# Installing the Hub

## Local Development

Create a virtualenv and

    $> pip install -r requirements.txt

### Required Environment Variables:

`HUB_DB_URL`
`SECRET_KEY`

For auth...

`MS_ACCESS_KEY`
`MS_SECRET_KEY`
`MS_ASSOCIATION_ID`

For search

`SEARCHBOX_SSL_URL`

I run elasticsearh locally and have the following config:

    SEARCHBOX_SSL_URL=http://localelastic:9200

For uploaded media:

`MEDIA_ROOT`

### Recommended

`DEBUG`

    DEBUG=1

### Required applications

`elasticsearch`

## Static Files

The hub uses scss, which needs to be compiled to css...

    $ npm install

You may also want to `collectstatic` depending on your staticfiles settings.

## Runing Tests

    $ ./manage.py test

## Database configuration

I recommend pulling down a copy of the production database from heroku. Refer to *heroku.md* for more info on that. You are also welcome to simply start a new postgres or sqlite3 db:

    $ ./manage.py migrate
