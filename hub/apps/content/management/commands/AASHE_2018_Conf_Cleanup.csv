Where civil rights fit into sustainability: an environmental justice workshop,"An in-depth exploration of how civil rights and environmental justice fit into the global sustainability framework, this presentation will utilize case studies from across the US to exemplify how environmental injustice is affecting the health of communities across the country. It is the purpose of this workshop to explore potential policy and non-policy solutions, as well as to better define the social pillar of sustainability. This presentation takes extensive research to draw that conclusion that perhaps the health disparities we see across the US are not genetic, but rather environmental.",3169,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Public Engagement,,,,,,"environmental justice,civil rights",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Rebecca Evans,3169,Campus Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9449/1430_Evans_0791.pdf,,,
Building Relationships Between Sustainability Offices and Diversity Offices,"Sustainability offices and diversity offices have a lot in common - both in our roles and in our subject matter. Both offices are change agents, frequently struggling against the same kinds of resistance. In subject matter, the historical roots of current environmental problems have a lot of overlap with the roots of inequality, and any lasting solution to one requires a solution to the other. There are compelling reasons for sustainability offices and diversity offices to collaborate, but building that bridge can be a challenge. The Zilkha Center for Environmental Initiatives at Williams College (our sustainability office) and the Davis Center (our center for social identity, inclusion and activism) have had an active and productive collaboration for years, including periodic joint staff meetings, strategic planning, and joint programming. That relationship was purposely developed over time, and this session will address how sustainability offices can follow a similar path. The session will cover four steps in building such a relationship: self-education, being a good ally/accomplice, building personal relationships and initiating joint programming. The presenter will use examples from Williams' experience to demonstrate the different stages and will provide a list of resources for further exploration.",59,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,Diversity & Multicultural Affairs,Sustainability Office,"social justice,on-campus collaboration",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Cecilia Del Cid,59,"Assistant Director, the Davis Center",Amy Johns,59,"Director, Zilkha Center for Environmental Initiatives",Mike Evans,59,"Assistant Director, Zilkha Center for Environmental Initiatives", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8436/1045_Evans_0830.pdf,,,
Step Changes in Climate Action: Data-Driven Plans to Decarbonize Campus Energy Systems,"Answering the call to address the climate crisis is one of the central themes of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Colleges and universities have been working to deploy energy efficient, net zero energy, and Living Building Challenge buildings on their campuses for a number of years to help meet their greenhouse gas reduction goals. However, many are now looking to develop date specific and dynamic decarbonization plans that examine how a campus can achieve fossil-fuel freedom through the total transformation of their energy systems. This effort to move towards real-time data-driven decision-making marks a cutting-edge development in energy planning on campuses. In this session, Dano Weisbord from Smith College and Laura Draucker from Amherst College will discuss the reasons behind their pursuit of holistic energy system transformations to achieve carbon neutrality, and how they both partnered with Integral Group to develop an innovative plan to meet our goals. They will also speak to how the plans are currently being implemented on their campuses, and their efforts to infuse the results of the decarbonization planning efforts into the curriculum on campus and into individual behavioral decisions by faculty, staff and students. Our session will guide the audience through the process of decision-making and planning for real-time and data-driven carbon positive colleges and universities.",2649,4705,7744,,,,,Energy,Air & Climate,Buildings,,,,,"carbon neutrality,energy reduction,energy management",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Laura Draucker,2649,Director of Sustainability,Dano Weisbord,4705,Director of Sustainability and Campus Planning,Bill Updike,7744,Principal, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8532/0915_Draucker_0921.pptx,,,
So You've Got Energy Meters - Now what? Dealing With the Other Challenges to Getting Energy Data,"It's hard to manage what you don't measure, and this is especially true with energy. We are strong believers in the role energy data analysis plays in helping us identify and prioritize projects, track progress, engage students, and drive behavior change. In an effort to act on this, we have also learned the hard way that it is never as simple as getting the funding and installing meters. While we have all seen great presentations on the benefits of metering, none of us were prepared for the additional questions and challenges that come with a metering project. Should you do them all at once or start small? Are your old meters collecting the right data or do they need to be replaced? Should you meter steam? Where does the data go and who has access to it? Do you want the data stored in the cloud or a server? Is the data real time? Who is even leading this project - facilities, sustainability, IT? If you are considering adding meters to campus, join us for an opportunity to learn from our mistakes and successes. If you have meters and have experiences you also want to share, please join us as well. This will be an open and frank discussion, with a goal to support each other in our efforts to reduce energy use on our campus and create living lab opportunities through data. This session will address the Partnership and Climate Action SDG goals.",2649,4705,59,,,,,Energy,Buildings,,,,,,energy metering,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Laura Draucker,2649,Director of Sustainability,Dano Weisbord,4705,Director of Sustainability and Campus Planning,Amy Johns,59,"Director, Zilkha Center for Environmental Initiatives", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8536/1130_Draucker_0923.pptx,,,
Reduce Peak Demand and Increase Grid Stability With On-Site Energy Storage,"The Austin Community College District (ACC) has installed a 72kW energy storage system on their Eastview campus. The grant funded battery project, known as Sustainable and Holistic Integration of Energy Storage (SHINES) was paid for by the Department of Energy and a competitive site selection process was managed through the local utility: Austin Energy. In this presentation we will discuss onsite energy storage as a viable option for higher education facilities, overall objectives and project goals, construction concerns, realized benefits, and answer questions. The Eastview campus was selected to host the SHINES Energy Storage System in part because of ACC's commitment to utilize this cutting edge battery system for education as well as site specific elements such as the campus' location in a growing part of town and a preexisting 100.8kW roof-mounted solar array. Energy storage mitigates the risk of a utility outage by supplying power during peak usage times to reduce the facility's burden on the grid and is a potential solution to the grid stability disadvantage caused by the intermittency and variability of other energy sources, such as solar production. The SHINES project attempts to demonstrate a solution adaptable to any region and market structure. Results, including daily output graphs showing the peak-shaving capabilities of the battery capacity and management software, will also be discussed.",2066,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,,,,,,energy storage,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Caleb Crow,2066,Sustainability Staff,Andy Kim,2066,"Director, Energy & Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8164/0830_Crow_0568.pdf,,,
"Bates College Conversion to Burn New Wood-Based, Liquid Fuel in Central Steam Plant","Bates College has begun burning a new, wood-based liquid fuel in its central steam plant - the first college in the country to do so. This new fuel, called Renewable Fuel Oil, has an extremely low carbon lifecycle emissions profile. The fuel is cheaper than natural gas, and because it is a liquid fuel, is much easier to retrofit compared to other biomass-based solutions. It has been an integral part of the College's ability to make large strides towards our Carbon Neutrality pledge of 2020. The fuel, if popularized, has the additional potential to revitalize the Northeast's struggling low-grade wood industry. We will share our process and lessons learned with the fuel, highlighting steps needed for schools interested in using this fuel.",4335,,,,,,,Energy,Air & Climate,Buildings,,,,,"biomass,biofuels",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Tom Twist,4335,Sustainability Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Estimating the financial feasibility and technical potential for solar PV on all U.S. schools,"In 2016, approximately 64% of total electricity generated in the United States came from fossil fuel sources, while approximately 2% came from solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation. Due to this mostly fossil fuel dependent electricity portfolio, electricity generation accounts for approximately 35% of total U.S. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions each year. Solar PV can significantly reduce emissions of CO2 and other harmful pollutants such as PM2.5, which have asymmetric negative effects for at-risk populations such as asthmatics, the elderly, and low-income families. According to the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) database, educational institutions account for 11% of total U.S. building electricity consumption and 14% of building floorspace - as a result, they contribute to approximately 4% of total U.S. CO2 emissions. Therefore, we wish to estimate the reductions in the emissions of CO2, PM2.5, SO2, and NOX and their associated avoided damages by installing solar PV on educational institutions throughout the United States. In previous work, we described a method for estimating the technical potential of solar PV on educational institutions using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data for 29% of all of the U.S. schools. Using only those estimates, we found a total technical potential of 12 GW and 19 TWh/yr, covering 0.1 billion m2 of rooftop space and serving 25 million students and teachers in associated facilities. In this paper, we perform a benefit-cost analysis (BCA) at the school-level for various scenarios to address these research questions: 1.        What are the total annualized lifetime cost and benefits - both private and public - of installing today rooftop solar PV systems on all U.S. educational institutions today? 2.        How sensitive are BCA results to the following inputs: (1) discount rate, (2) value of excess generation, (3) financing (i.e. third party ownership options), and (4) value of mitigated damages?",2849,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,,,,,,solar,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Inês Azevedo,2849,Professor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

"The Upgrade Alternative: When Energy Upgrades Prove Cost Prohibitive, Microgrids Offer Another Path","K-12 and higher education systems across the U.S. and beyond often struggle to upgrade or install energy efficient HVAC and other energy equipment in the face of shrinking budgets, escalating electricity bills and aging infrastructure. A program introduced by The Hawaii Department of Education offers a solution for schools and institutions worldwide who are wrestling with similar economic pressures. In response to a $1.6 billion campus air conditioning installation shortfall, the Hawaii Department of Education found a game-changing solution in microgrids. The capital cost of implementing microgrids with roof-top PV+storage together with split system A/C units to cool individual classrooms proved to be substantially lower than traditional central air systems. Plus, having on-site energy storage and flexibility in programming the power electronics allowed schools to keep their current energy costs and energy access stable while maintaining grid-connection for backup power. Looking at the Hawaii case study and beyond, this session will examine how creating distributed microgrid assets that spare the cost of infrastructure upgrades and reduce energy costs month-over-month can offer a new avenue to improved operations, sustainability and long term energy resiliency for the education sector. Beyond a compelling economic case, the session will also touch on the added benefit of microgrids in helping to insulate colleges and universities from grid instability and lack of availability in times of natural disaster or other crises.",8354,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,,,,,,"microgrids,disaster & emergency response",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Catherine Von Burg,8354,CEO and President, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9600/1430_VonBurg_0966.pdf,,,
University of Denver's Renter Efficiency Program for Students,"The University of Denver's Renter Efficiency Program for Students offers free energy audits to students who are renting off campus houses or apartments. The goal of these energy audits is to teach energy and water efficient practices. This includes how to program a thermostat, how to identify and fix drafty windows, how to install weather stripping to doors, and many other energy and water efficient practices. This service is provided because students often don't feel like investing into a property they will only spend a few months in just to save on their energy bills, and the landlords do not make improvements since they typically don't pay the energy bills. By offering this program for free, we solve this split incentive dilemma between renters and landlords not wanting to make energy efficient improvements to the property.",2186,,,,,,,Energy,Air & Climate,Buildings,,,,,"housing,energy audits",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Aziz Syammach,2186,"REPS Program Lead, Center for Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9009/1430_Syammach_0300.pdf,,,
Rising to Meet the Challenge of 100% Renewable Energy,"Campuses are increasingly looking to renewable energy as the most financially attractive strategy for making dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieving their GHG goals. The costs of renewables has dropped significantly and, as a result, campuses are rapidly adopting onsite solar. While onsite solar is highly visible, it is rarely sufficient to meet GHG goals. This workshop covers a portfolio of approaches that can be part of a comprehensive strategy. Specifically, this workshop will: - provide a process for campuses to identify strategies appropriate to their size, location, and energy context - outline key considerations for executing a comprehensive renewable energy strategy - review case studies from three campuses targeting 100% renewables with three different sets of challenges and opportunities. Topics will include: - on-campus solar sites; community solar; offsite projects, including regulated and deregulated markets, and out-of-state solutions; aggregating to achieve scale; stakeholder management; academic integration.",2869,2246,5184,,,,,Energy,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"renewable energy,solar",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Rob Andrejewski,2869,Director of Sustainability,Dennis Carlberg,2246,Sustainability Director,Christen Blum,5184,Managing Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7874/0830_Carlberg_0290.pptx,,,
A Billion Dollar Deal: Public-Private Energy Partnership Advances Campus Effort Beyond Efficiency,"In July 2017, Ohio State launched an innovative approach to sustainably manage its building energy use, in a manner that will provide significant energy management knowledge and financial capital back to the university to further the university's academic and sustainability goals. Through a 50 year, $1.165 billion lease agreement, the university has transferred the operation of its energy delivery assets to Ohio State Energy Partners (OSEP), a private sector entity consisting of energy industry experts. One portion of this agreement requires OSEP to make the university's Columbus campus buildings 25% more energy efficient within a decade. In addition, OSEP will invest $150 million back into the university to help achieve the university's academic and sustainability goals, including student scholarships and internships, faculty and curriculum endowments, sustainability fund endowment, annual philanthropic giving, and a new visionary project to advance energy-related innovations from the research lab to the private sector market. This creative management agreement creates new financial resources for the university without creating bonded debt.

Getting to 100% Renewable Electricity,"Colorado State University (CSU) signed the Climate Reality Pledge in January 2017 - pledging to achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2030. Since electricity is responsible for ~50% of CSU's GHG footprint, this aligned well with CSU's existing ACUPCC pledge and goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The University of Denver (DU) has committed to 5% onsite renewables and 20% offsite renewables by 2025, with an interim goal of 24% GHG reduction by 2020, on the way to carbon neutrality by 2050. Even before all these commitments were made, university staff at both institutions have been working toward achieving these goals. Easy? Not easy? Some US states have 'retail choice' - where customers can choose their electricity provider. Colorado is not one of those states. Our electricity provider is determined strictly by geography - customers are stuck with the utility that serves that location - and with that utility's generation 'mix'. How do we get to 100% renewable electricity when: 1) the current mix is about mostly coal 2) we lack retail choice and 3) we intend to take physical delivery of the renewable electricity? This session will cover the paths taken, the bridges crossed and the chasms yet to span. In spite of barriers, throughout 2018, CSU and DU will be actively pursuing our ambitious renewable electricity goals - and may have success to report and share. Let's talk!

Scaling UP Renewable Energy Beyond Campus,"The Paris Agreement (at the moment) represents civilizations best path forward for global action and accountability of our collective reduction in harmful greenhouse gas emissions. What happens when a significant player backs away? The 'We are still in' movement has captured the attention of a broad coalition of parties committed to the Paris Agreement, specifically, the United States Climate Alliance. New York State is a committed member. New York State, also, has a large number of Colleges and Universities with firm commitments for Climate Action. Through grassroots networking and mutual goals, the New York Campus Aggregate Renewable Energy Solutions (NYCARES) coalition is in the process of pooling our need and our resources for a large portion of New York State's Commitment to supporting the Paris Agreement. This session will explore key milestones of developing the public / private partnership, garnering both internal and external institutional support, risk assessment, economies of scale beyond a single owner / buyer, and other legal / contractual aspects of Large Scale Renewable Energy (LSRE) development.

Transforming Our Tomorrow - A New Clean Energy Vision,"Whenever, I run into a problem I can't solve, I always make it bigger. I can never solve it by trying to make it smaller, but if I make it big enough I can begin to see the outlines of a solution.' This wise counsel from President Dwight D. Eisenhower, helped us rethink our approach to achieving our clean energy goals and provided us with a new frame that is beginning to demonstrate how we can scale climate change mitigation efforts to provide maximum impact both on our campus and beyond. The Localizing our Renewable Energy Future initiative--spearheaded by the University at Buffalo--aims to invest in the region while reducing energy costs for a who's who of Buffalo-area anchoring institutions (City of Buffalo, Erie County, University at Buffalo, Buffalo State College, and SUNY Erie Community College). The effort is also working to help save taxpayer dollars while creating more efficient budgeting for the participating institutions. There are three specific objectives that are being addressed: 1) The establishment of 100 new megawatts of renewable energy--enough to provide 50% of clean energy needs for participating partners, mostly in the form of solar power, by 2020. 2) The creation of clean energy student engagement space for curricular and experiential learning activities as well as sustainability oriented groups on campus and local non-profits focused on clean energy. 3) Expanding our clean energy curriculum and creating the next generation of clean energy.",1306,5184,,,,,,Energy,,,,,,,"renewable energy,solar",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Tonga Pham,1306,Associate Vice President for University Facilities,Christen Blum,5184,Managing Director,Ryan McPherson,1306,Chief Sustainability Officer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7856/0915_McPherson_0278.pptx,,,
The Impact of Real-time Visual Feedback on Electric Consumption at Middlebury College,"The typical associations with 'energy efficiency' are production oriented. However, in order to make a meaningful impact, these innovative production solutions need to be matched equally with creative ways to reduce consumption (SDG #12: 'Responsible Consumption and Production'). In a world of global connectedness, the only indication of electric use to the average consumer is in the form of a bill at the end of the month. For college students, even that small notion is lost, severing all connection between behavior and ecological impact. The first step to bridging this gap in institutions of higher education is transparency around resource consumption. In three buildings (12 townhouse apartments) at Middlebury College, LED strips were installed to provide residents with real-time feedback on their current electric usage, as compared to a baseline. The creative design behind this project is a prime example of interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together students, faculty in three departments, and facilities staff members. Moreover, the design of the device does not rely on a third-party, meaning that it can be morphed for applications in countless other sustainability projects across campus (e.g., an alert system to reduce peak loads, building competitions, art installations showing all-campus consumption). In addition to the strength of the learning model, the LED strips have significantly changed the way that the residents engage with electric consumption.",532,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,,,"behavior change,energy reduction",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Thomas Wentworth,532,Undergraduate Student,John Byrne,532,"Director, Office of Sustainability Integration", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8088/0830_Wentworth_0512.pdf,,,
Creating a Successful Campus Temperature Policy,"Heating and cooling account for more than 60% of Wesleyan's energy and carbon footprint. In 2013, Wesleyan's Utilities Manager estimated that we could reduce our energy consumption 20%, or approximately $1.6 million, through basic conservation measures. To address this, Wesleyan established its first Energy Conservation Policy, which identified target temperature ranges in campus buildings. Four years in, we have seen great success, including decreases in energy consumption and greater buy-in campus-wide for energy conservation. The foci of the policy are: 1. Reducing the environmental impact of Wesleyan through energy conservation makes us a more responsible steward of the planet's resources. This reduction in energy usage improves local air quality, global air quality through reduced carbon emissions, and reduced need for natural gas. 2. Wesleyan has spent millions on energy conservation efforts over the past 15 years, but until the policy, very little had been done to invite students and employees to play a role in this process, instead making reduction of energy costs the 'the administration's job.' Energy conservation through this policy allows us to divert utility funding to campus projects that further improve energy efficiency and encourage conservation, as well as to invest in renewable energy. 3. Discomfort issues nullified Wesleyan's past attempts at temperature guidelines. In implementing this policy, we created comfort suggestions and educational materials and worked with each department on campus to ensure their considerations were accounted for in plan development. Wesleyan is one of few schools that have successfully implemented such a policy. Gaining buy-in from our campus president on down that this new policy is 'what we do' at Wesleyan has helped immensely in making this policy culturally successful . This policy has overall been a success on campus with tangible results, decreasing our environmental impact and energy costs.",3771,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,,,"energy conservation,temperature controls",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jennifer Kleindienst,3771,Sustainability Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8994/1430_Kleindienst_0281.pdf,,,
Student-Developed Energy Management Information System,"Like many other educational institutions, our college cares about the efficient use of energy and seeks ways to reduce its impact on the environment. We promote energy-wise behavior among students, faculty, and staff; however, their overall effect is limited. The greater return on investment lies with a handful of people, usually facilities staff. We have realized that using real-time data with the help of an energy management information system (EMIS) can better affect the return for individual projects. This is accomplished by evaluating energy efficiency, forecasting future consumption, detecting abnormal energy use and optimizing overall efficiency. Like all institutions, we have limited financial resources and staff, so we have employed low-cost electricity meters. We struggled with visualizing and leveraging data in a standard spreadsheet program, which provides far less analysis than that of an EMIS; so, we have created a solution to overcome these limitations. As a model of both Urban Sustainability and a Living Laboratory, the Sustainability Office hired a first-year computer science major to develop an interactive web portal featuring various visualizations including a heat map, as well as a tool for automated meter data collection. This solution proved to be an invaluable tool for our energy manager and other facilities staff. Together during this presentation, we will explore the process of creating an interactive and intuitive dashboard.",4603,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"students,energy management,dashboards",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Tomas Panek,4603,Student; Developer at Sustainability Office,Kurt Miller,4603,Sustainability Project Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

Turning Energy Challenges into Solutions at Higher Education Facilities,"While budget cuts and finite resources can often act as hurdles to enacting energy efficiency improvements, these investments can produce long-term and unmatched benefits that significantly reduce overall energy expenses and improve the energy-related equipment, infrastructure, and systems at higher education facilities. Constellation, one of the country's leading energy providers, helps higher education institutions achieve their sustainability goals, develop energy resiliency strategies, and manage their costs and capital expenditure liabilities. Energy efficiency upgrades can generate millions in savings within a single year. Having worked with colleges and universities nationwide including Ohio University, Mercyhurst University, Salem State University, and the University of Maryland, Constellation is uniquely positioned to speak about large-scale, innovative energy overhaul projects. Having overseen many of these projects, Marc Aronson, Senior Business Development Manager, and Bob Belyea, Principal Technical Sales Manager, can discuss how performance-based energy efficiency and sustainability solutions can help higher education facilities address their energy challenges. They will also speak to specific strategies that can assist colleges and universities in improving their current energy utilization.

Paying for Sustainable Development from Wasted Energy,"The World Green Building Council posits that green buildings support nine UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Public-Private Partnerships (P3) have become a popular mechanism for higher education institutions to transform existing infrastructure to green buildings. Outsourcing construction, financial, and operational risks enable higher-ed institutions to upgrade energy infrastructure, lower energy consumption, enhance campus sustainability, and create better learning environments. Financing barriers arise as public higher-ed institutions are often unable or unwilling to invest funds in energy efficiency projects and higher-priority needs demand limited funds. Hence, institutions often seek external financing for these types of projects. However, financial institutions are generally reluctant to provide loans for multiple reasons, such as perceived high-risk energy efficiency projects. The use of public-private partnerships can utilize private-sector financing. In this approach, the customer engages a commercial service provider to design and implement an improvement project with its compensation connected to the performance of the project. Generally some form of performance guarantee (such as a guarantee of energy savings) is provided by the service provider. A few examples of P3 benefits include no upfront capital needed, various financing mechanisms available, project risk displacement, and turnkey service. P3 helps university leadership secure funding, find ongoing support, and align future funding, while engaging students in the project as learning experiences. From a decade of experience at Kutztown and UMass Dartmouth Universities, we will explore the merits of P3 projects that benefit people employed by, and living on, their campus.

Using Sub-Metering to Prioritize and Measure Energy Management Projects,"Every institution faces limitations as it relates to spending money. These limitations can be on operating budgets, staffing levels, or both. It is paramount while operating within these limits to direct resources towards the most important projects. But how do you know which are the most important? As a result of installing low-cost sub-meters, the College has been able to prioritize energy efficiency projects that have saved considerable funds and millions of kilowatt hours of electricity. Additionally, after a project, the College has been able to use the sub-meter data to verify the effectiveness of each of the projects. This verifications is critical for both processing rebates to utilities as well as tracking our progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Join us for this session to learn how you can identify, prioritize, and verify energy management projects.",4603,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Water,,,,,"energy metering,energy efficiency",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Kurt Miller,4603,Sustainability Project Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Occupant Engagement and Centralized Controls: a Hybrid Energy Management Solution With Major Savings,"Introduction: Plug loads (PL), devices plugged into wall outlets, comprise approximately 1/3 of electricity use of commercial buildings, and are expected to rise to 1/2 by 2030. Traditional PL reduction strategies, such as centralized controls, fail to incorporate the role of building occupants in PL performance. A novel PL management technology (Keewi Inc.) enables occupants to take part in managing their energy use. This study presents results from implementation of socially-driven and centralized PL management at the University of Maryland (College Park, MD). Methods: 171 devices in 42 offices and 76 devices in 4 concessions at the XFINITY Center were plugged into Keewi smart plugs that provided energy monitoring, remote on/off and schedule-based controls. After 78 days of baseline energy data collection for each device, staff in the offices were given access to their personalized energy data through the Keewi mobile app. For 102 days, participants took part in a game of PL energy management with points, rewards and team competitions to reduce energy use. Devices in concessions, on the other hand, were turned off centrally on dark days (intervention period: 36 days) and the average daily base load was calculated. Results: Office occupants using the Keewi app achieved a 32.0% reduction in daily electricity consumption during intervention compared to baseline. Of the 31 participants, 27 showed positive energy savings with Keewi's socially-driven PL management system. During intervention, the median participant logged into the app 21 times and spent 45 minutes on the app. The most active occupants, who spent at least 2 hours on the app, achieved a reduction of 48.7% in their personal energy use. Centralized controls in concessions, on the other hand, reduced average daily base load consumption by 17.2%. Conclusions: This study demonstrates effectiveness of a hybrid strategy with socially-driven and centralized PL management in higher educational facilities.",8283,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,,,occupant engagement,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Hedi Razavi,8283,Co-founder and COO, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10374/1430_Razavi_1099.pdf,,,
How to Benchmark Your Building in Five Minutes or Less,"As a management practice, benchmarking involves tracking building performance by regularly measuring key performance indicators such as energy use and periods of peak and low demand. Benchmarking then compares current performance against past performance, or current performance to that of other similar buildings. Unfortunately, the challenges of benchmarking often get more attention than its many benefits. By energy benchmarking an organization can establish energy reduction targets, identify savings opportunities and stay on budget throughout the year. Lucid Design Group (Lucid) is a software company that works to improve the operational, environmental, and financial performance of building portfolios through the better use of building data. In 2016, Lucid began a collaboration with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) through a small business voucher offered by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the purpose of making energy benchmarking easier and more accessible to facilities/sustainability managers thereby reducing the energy use of buildings on a broad scale. The outcome of this unique collaboration was, Benchmark My Building, a free public-facing energy benchmarking tool that leverages the Energy Star Portfolio Manager (ESPM) and DOE Building Performance databases to allow anyone with internet access to start benchmarking their building(s) and to visualize the value of improving efficiency in terms of dollars and cents.

Campus-Wide Change: Turn Down for Watt,"Northern Michigan University's EcoReps and Facilities Management hosted the first Turn Down the Lights campaign during Sustainability Week in March 2018. During this week, corridor lights were turned off in 14 academic buildings on campus. This amounted to a week long savings of 5,600 kilowatt hours and a financial savings of $700. Outreach took place through campus-wide postings, stickers, and tabeling sessions. 'Why are the hallways dark?' was a common catalyst for discussion on campus. Students and staff not typically reached by campus sustainability programming were directly engaged by this visual representation of institutional energy consumption. If these corridor lights were permanently turned off, this could equate to a savings of $36,000 a year.5,600 kilowatthours were avoided which equates to electricity necessary to run NMU's Heating Plant for approximately 3 days.",3209,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,,,"energy reduction,events",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Marley Redd,3209,EcoReps Intern, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10405/1430_Redd_1104.pdf,,,
Transitioning a 100-year Legacy of Campus Steam to 21st Century Geothermal,"Colleges and universities are leading the way on the next generation of energy solutions. Efficiency, decarbonization, and cost management are important elements of these programs, yet how we engage the campus and community in both the technical and financial solutions is critical to success. Carleton College will provide an overview of their plan to reduce carbon emissions, energy consumption and operating cost by transitioning the campus steam heating system to a 'low temperature' hot water system tied to three geothermal borefields. This approach not only diversifies the campus fuel mix but also makes integration of renewables much more attainable.

From Student Power to Renewable Energy: A New Approach to Investing in Solar,"Over the last year and a half, students at Southern Oregon University have worked to develop an innovative new approach to funding solar. Inspired by the power purchase agreement model, the SOU student government has established a similar agreement with the university itself to fund new solar panels on campus. The 'Solar PPA' both increases the amount of renewable energy used on campus and provides revenue that is allocated towards the development of new sustainability-related projects through reinvestment in the university Green Fund. This session will discuss the strategies employed by student government to make this project a reality, and how it can be replicated or adapted to other colleges and universities.

The Present & Future of the Open Energy Dashboard,"The Open Energy Dashboard needs your help! OED is a free, open source energy dashboard that continues rapid development with 8-20 student programmers per semester and an expanding user base. Major features added over the last year include expanded graphical representations to support sustainability goals, ability to acquire new types of meter data, multilingual support, site customizations, and enhanced mobile support. In the first half of this presentation, we will demonstrate the capabilities of OED and ask for audience input on these features. Do they do what you want? Could they be improved? In the second half of the presentation will engage the audience in where OED should be going. There are many requests for features such as allowing more resource types and semiautomatic baselining (in progress); maps, tracking projections vs actual savings, social media, incorporation of weather data, and much more. The researchers working on the OED want the sustainability community to decide the directions we take so your insights into the next features for development are critical to the project.",187,,,,,,,Energy,Campus Engagement,,,,,,dashboards,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Steven Huss-Lederman,187,Assoc.

Shifting to 100% Renewable Campuses and Communities,"College and university campuses can lead the way toward a future powered by 100 percent renewable energy. With the effects of climate change growing ever more apparent, and with the federal government doubling down on dirty fossil fuels, it's up to us to lead the way forward. Environment America and the Student PIRGs are working to shift America towards 100 percent renewable energy. To realize this vision, we're starting at the local level, working to win commitments to 100 percent renewable energy from colleges and universities. So far, several colleges and universities have committed to transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy, however we need even more in higher education to lead. In this session, we'll share our vision for 100 percent renewable energy, our recent progress, and the resources we've developed to help campuses switch to renewable energy. We'll discuss opportunities to lead a campaign for 100 percent renewable energy on campuses and the importance of student power and action on campus.",8628,8302,,,,,,Energy,Campus Engagement,,,,,,renewable energy,10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Sophie Haddad,8628,Board Chair and Student,Jake Taber,8302,Clean Energy Fellow, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Hitting Bumps in the Road to Renewables,"Almost every month it seems like a new renewable energy project is announced on a college campus, feeding a sense of urgency at those colleges and universities who have not yet installed their first solar panel. And, as sustainability-conscious students, faculty and staff increase their calls for climate action in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals ('take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts') and the We Are Still In movement, the pressure is on to implement more green energy projects. However, the road from idea to implementation is not always smooth and sometimes even with support at the highest levels, renewable energy projects fail to come to fruition. We will describe and analyze two examples of renewable energy projects that, despite strong commitment and lots of background work, failed to actually be implemented. The first presenter is from a large, public, research university and the second is from a small, private liberal arts college, allowing comparisons between different funding and organization types. Each presenter will describe the project their institution was hoping to implement, what background work was completed, why the project fell apart, and lessons learned from the process. We hope that by sharing the details of our failed projects, instead of focusing on successes, attendees can plan for and avoid hitting the same bumps in the road to their own renewable energy projects.",2990,1109,,,,,,Energy,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,renewable energy,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Margaret Bounds,2990,Assistant Director of Sustainability,Malte Weiland,1109,Sustainability Staff, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7747/0830_Bounds_0145.pdf,,,
University of Houston-Downtown Embraces Student Engagement in Urban Agriculture and Sustainability,"The University of Houston-Downtown has created a Center for Urban Agriculture and Sustainability (CUAS) to support research, teaching and community outreach. The program not only expands the educational opportunities for UHD students but it aims to ultimately improve Houston neighborhoods through the education of the next generation of Houston's leaders. The current initiatives that engage students fall into two categories. Students may submit green project grants for funding and the center typically funds about 10 per year. The second program is a summer experiential learning program where students from different majors work together in teams to plan, build and test a system that builds on the university's sustainable initiatives. Here we highlight two summer projects for the UHD Sustainability Garden - an automated composting system and an aquaponics system. The aquaponics system was developed as a low-cost, small-scale, and observable fish-plant ecosystem that utilizes solar energy for water-flow and can be implemented to reduce food costs and to provide opportunities for the biological and ecological research. Students also designed an automated composting system that mixes compost using solar power so that compost can be made more efficiently from the leftover food from the UHD food court. All student projects allow for hands-on experience and require the integration of the concepts outlined in UN Sustainable Development Goals.",1503,,,,,,,Research,Curriculum,,Agriculture,,,,"urban focus,project based learning",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Roshani Malla,1503,Sustainability Coordinator,Daniel Adrian,1503,Student,Mario Alavez,1503,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9976/1430_Malla_1045.pdf,,,
Renewable Energy for Campus Facilities Services,"Through our case study, we were able to demonstrate that a self-sustaining biodiesel program could be effectively operated on the Black Hills State University campus as well as potentially other campuses across the country. As a smaller university BHSU uses about 500 gallons of fuel every year to maintain campus. Over half of that is diesel and could be converted to biofuel. As equipment and vehicles are traded out, purchasing diesel-run equipment will further enhance the impact of this case study. By demonstrating the ease of such a program, we hope to inspire others to utilize cost effective ways to reduce GHG emissions on campus and reduce waste. We have demonstrated an innovative, easily replicable model for other small to mid-sized institutions wishing to reduce waste, costs and environmental impacts. We have successfully shown the university that a biodiesel program would help meet our carbon neutrality and zero waste goals, while also demonstrating innovative ways for students to practically apply what they learn in the classroom. By working with a variety of stakeholders and demonstrating effectiveness, this program is set to grow and further strengthen our already substantial impact. As the program grows we intend to partner with community entities to further divert waste from the landfill and re-use for biofuel. Beyond the scientific knowledge we gained in the lab, this project gave us a better understanding of sustainability and the process involved in implementing sustainable practices at a university level. From designing and following our goals to presenting our findings, our experiences during this case study have helped develop our dedication to sustainability. We began this project committed to making an impact during our tenure and finished knowing that we could fundamentally change the way the university views it's disposal of waste. Additionally, this project has also expanded our knowledge of and commitment to environmental resiliency.",603,,,,,,,Energy,Waste,,,,Facilities Management,,"biodiesel,biofuels",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Liam Porter,603,Undergraduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9813/1430_Porter_1021.pdf,,,
Thompson Rivers University - The Solar Compass: A Case Study on Ground Mounted Solar Modules,"In the summer of 2017, a collective of faculty, students, industry professionals and an innovative photo voltaic manufacturer installed North America's first ground mounted solar array. The installation is on Thompson Rivers University's campus, in sunny Kamloops in the interior of BC in Canada. Dr. Michael Mehta, professor of Environmental Studies teamed up with Electrical Instructor Amie Schellenberg and Solar Earth Technologies to bring the revolutionary installation to life. There were two phases to the project, which was funded by a $25k grant from TRU's Sustainability Grant fund. The first phase was to install a small stretch of solar sidewalk, and the second is the show stopping Solar Compass located at the heart of the campus grounds. A total of 10kW are installed (between both installations) and grid-connected via micro inverter to a single phase supply at the sidewalk, and a 3 phase supply at the compass. Data is being collected and analyzed, and improvements are being made to the module manufacturing and installation process. We will be discussing the uniqueness of the modules, the installation, and the potential for this amazing technology.",1431,,,,,,,Energy,Grounds,,,,,,"solar,solar panels",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Aaron Wiebe,1431,Research Assistant,James Gordon,1431,Environmental Programs & Research Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10119/1430_Gordon_0811.pdf,,,
Getting to a Green Light: How to Build Organizational Buy-In for Large-Scale Renewable Energy,"This interactive and action-oriented session will provide insights and tools to update your understanding of renewable energy, map out critical stakeholders on campus, and translate the renewable energy opportunity into their language to get buy-in. Participants will learn how to build and communicate the business case for large-scale renewable energy. Despite renewable energy technology cost continuously declining, and a growing interest in leveraging renewables to cost-effectively meet carbon reduction goals, many campus leaders struggle to get out of the 'starting block' on procuring renewable energy at scale. Without a mandate from the top, a major challenge centers on building understanding and buy-in among cross-functional colleagues and administrative leadership. Learn from your peers on how Brown University and Michigan State University began their renewable energy journey, built organizational buy-in, navigated the process through calmer and stormier waters, and ultimately received the 'green light' from leadership. Like any large energy project on campus, large-scale renewable energy purchasing requires the involvement and 'green light' from multiple decision-makers. While typically not requiring any upfront capital outlay, it still represents a significant deviation from business-as-usual 1-3-year grid power procurement. Equipping campus leaders with tools and language to effectively communicate about large-scale renewable energy is key.",7676,439,4390,,,,,Energy,Investment & Finance,Purchasing,,,,,"renewable energy,large-scale renewable energy",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Susanne Fratzscher,7676,Director BD,Ann Erhardt,439,Chief Sustainability Officer,Leah VanWey,4390,Associate Provost for Academic Space, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Contracting for Renewable Energy Procurement: Financing and Legal Strategies and Considerations,"Colleges and universities are adopting aggressive sustainability targets and deadlines to reduce carbon emissions. To meet these targets, institutions have a range of options, including installing on-site energy generation and storage projects; investing in off-site electric power generation facilities; engaging in long-term purchases of renewable power; entering into comprehensive energy management contracts; and exploring other innovative self-generation and power purchase arrangements, including through utilities. Moreover, in many U.S. energy markets, renewable generation is becoming the most cost-effective long term option for commercial and institutional users. The financial opportunities for universities are substantial. Designing and implementing a strategy for large scale renewables procurement can save millions of dollars in the short term, and reduce exposure to energy price swings over time. Contracting for renewable energy brings a host of financial and legal issues that are new to universities. Experience from higher education renewable energy projects to date offers helpful lessons learned. And this is an area that has been extensively developed in the business context, as utilities and major corporations have focused on contracting for renewables for over two decades. This panel will discuss options and strategies for smoothing the pathway to an effective renewables strategy.",8233,,,,,,,Energy,Investment & Finance,Purchasing,,,,,"power purchase agreements (PPAs),renewable energy",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Jim Wrathall,8233,"Counsel, K&L Gates LLP", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8312/1445_Wrathall_0693.ppt,,,
Creating Campus Revenue Streams to Support Sustainability Initiatives,"Educational institutions across North America are aiming to reduce both energy spend and GHG emissions, with targets ranging from 10%-50% by 2030, 2025, or even 2020. At the same time, financial constraints appear to limit possibilities. This presentation will present creative solutions to planning, implementing and financing immediate equipment upgrades to support the long-term mission of sustainability directors. The presenters are all sustainability leads on campus, and have all found ways to work directly with their counterparts in facilities management to ensure a joint vision for the future. When Adelphi University's boilers were at end of life, the Facilities Department had an opportunity to rethink infrastructure rather than simply replace equipment. In light of high electricity rates on Long Island, they decided to self-generate with a CHP facility, reducing their GHG emissions by 3,850 metric tons (a 25% reduction) in one year and creating a significant revenue stream through savings to fund infrastructure upgrades across campus. While Ithaca College pays significantly lower rates for electricity, their ambitious carbon goals recently drove them to use wind energy for all their electricity needs. This important step has eliminated the College's Scope 2 emissions and has enabled them to get 35% closer to complete carbon neutrality. The College intends to use the RECs (renewable energy certificates) associated with the 2016 installation of the solar farm.",3169,8536,439,4390,,,,Energy,Investment & Finance,,,,,,"energy management,revenue generation,energy reduction",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Gregory Lischke,3169,Director Energy Management & Sustainability,Marc Couture,8536,"P.Eng, CEM, PMP, Solutions Developer",Ann Erhardt,439,Chief Sustainability Officer,Jessica Berry,4390,"Director, Office of Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8625/1445_Matte_0996.pdf,,,
Agrivoltaic Arrays: Cultivating the Future of Renewable Energy,"Agrivoltaics' combines the terms, 'agriculture' and 'photovoltaics' to create a symbiotic relationship between food and renewable energy. The vast majority of solar energy generated comes from solar farms. However, as solar farms are created, potential agricultural land is lost. This project could prove that the production of clean energy and food are not mutually exclusive, in a system where the solar panels provide shade for the plants from the harsh sun, enabling more efficient growth for the plants, which in turn cool the solar panels above via evapotranspiration (in some cases by more than 20°F), making them more efficient. At the University of Arizona, only 0.5% of energy generation is from on-campus solar, despite being in one of the sunniest regions in the nation. Once completed, the installation of a rooftop agrivoltaic array will revitalize the solar energy effort on the UA campus that was paused in 2012. This project will not only improve sustainability by drastically improving land use efficiency for energy and food production, but will also serve as a site for experiential education and community outreach, as well as a place for research. Together, this project will generate approximately 50,000 kWh per year and a savings of $101,338 in utility bills over the course of 20 years. Additionally, it will provide unparalleled insights into how we can transform underutilized rooftops here in the arid Southwest, and on the UA campus (a fresh food desert).",4465,,,,,,,Energy,Public Engagement,,,,,,"agrivoltaics,renewable energy",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Stanley Wong,4465,Energy and Climate Committee Chair, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7765/1130_Wong_0173.pdf,,,
Student Funded Initiatives & the Intersections of Social Justice & Sustainability,"This is going to address clear and tangible ways students can have agency and autonomy over some of their Student Activity Fees in order to create more than just a 'Green Fund' which can help to provide students, staff, and faculty ways to fund important efforts, initiatives, and events that promote and further support a more just and sustainable future. What we will look at is how this is also an opportunity for the voices from marginalized groups who have often been unheard can participate more in this creating a more equitable, and inclusive sustainability movement at our schools. We'll also explore some of the programs and events that we at Portland Community College have done that involve food insecurity, women's health and empowerment, social/environmental justice work, and some of the classic sustainability initiatives that have improved our school, like learning gardens at all four campuses, cob structures (ovens and sheds), water filling stations, reusable dining ware, and composting systems. This will be a presentation format that will welcome plenty of audience engagement and participation. By examining and exploring the intersections of social justice and sustainability through this student funded program, we will also help to illuminate how intrinsically connected these two areas truly are. Ideally, at the end of this we can all feel even more connected moving forward and genuinely appreciate even more that we are all in this together.",2505,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,food security,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Teri Fane,2505,"Student Body President ~ Cascade Campus, Portland Community College",Joe Culhane,2505,Sustainability Communications Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10202/0830_Culhane_0905.pdf,,,

Encouraging Sustainable Food Purchasing Through Student Programs,"Many institutions endeavor to serve local and sustainable food within its dining services, but the complex and often opaque food system presents significant challenges to identifying and sourcing responsibly-produced products. To address these complexities, Skidmore College, a small liberal-arts College in upstate New York, developed a series of programs to improve the transparency of our food system, provide accountability, deepen campus consciousness, and shift food dollars to food that meet the institution's Sustainable Food metrics. This presentation will explore how a number of interconnected programs including an academic internship, a weekly low-impact dining initiative, and a student outreach team support our efforts to meet institutional sustainability goals. Collectively, the programs provide students with an opportunity to interrogate food purchases, conduct semester-long independent research, work alongside chefs to amend recipes, and deepen campus consciousness through dialogues, events, and lectures. Skidmore's diverse array of programs is the result of more than five years of development and growth. The programs offered by Skidmore's Sustainability Office and Dining Services provide a strong foundation to build upon, but there is more to achieve.

BYO[Solutions]: Reuse Programs in Campus Dining,"College campuses are hubs of waste, from plastic bags to disposable food containers and single-use coffee cups. However, universities can use this opportunity to implement waste-reduction programs with the aim of instilling sustainable habits on students that will follow them into life after college. At the University of Pittsburgh we've seized this opportunity to encourage sustainable habits through the BYO[Bag] and BYO[Mug] programs. These programs educate students about packaging waste and encourage students to adopt a reuse mindset to reduce waste and save money. Before the BYO[Bag] program Pitt's Oakland campus went through 15,000 plastic bags each week. A student-supported 25¢ charge for single-use bags paired with an education campaign resulted in a 97% reduction in bag use on campus while raising money for the student Green Fund. Following BYO[Bag]'s success, we rebranded our reusable mug program to approach the problem of single-use coffee cups and are in the process of launching a campus-wide reusable container program. Our goal is to serve at least half of our beverages and to-go meals in reusable containers. We haven't figured it all out yet but we're well on our way and already have some wins behind us.",760,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Waste,,,Dining Services,,"reuse,waste reduction,reusable containers",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Nick Goodfellow,760,Sustainability Coordinator,Lyndee Feick,760,Sodexo Intern, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8013/0830_Goodfellow_0435.pdf,,,
Empowering Student Leaders to Create a Zero Waste Food Court,"In order to divert 95% of solid waste from the landfill, UCI Hospitality & Dining (HDS) and Aramark collaborate with Social Ecology Field Study interns, Campus as a Living Lab interns, a Global Foods Initiative Fellow, Green Captains, and members of organizations such as Engineers for a Sustainable World. Together, these students work with Dining's Sustainability Coordinator to plan and host quarterly events such as Wiping Out Waste, MyLastTrash activities, and Trash Talking. Students also conduct waste audits, write grant submissions, and develop project proposals. Although most of them are not environmental science or sustainability majors, 88% of the Green Captains said that they've learned more about sustainability since joining the program. While working at events, students develop leadership, public speaking, and management skills. Since joining, 94% of the Green Captains state that their leadership qualities 'have grown tremendously'. At the end of events, students fill out an evaluation to determine whether or not the event was successful and impactful. Large scale projects are also led by students. Recently, HDS installed Digital Waste Bins, an interactive system that informs guests of the carbon-equivalent emissions of their trash. For projects like the bins, Interns and fellows write project and grant proposals, and once it is funded, a student group that specializes in the subject takes the reins. For the Digital Waste Bins, HDS partnered with Engineers for a Sustainable World, a student group at UCI. The students worked on the project together, with weekly check-ins from the HDS Sustainability Coordinator. They delegated tasks between themselves, budgeted the expenses, and determined what software to use to program the devices. In just five months, HDS has developed initiatives that save over 26,000 gallons of water, divert 12% additional solids from the landfill, and tripled its number of waste education events.",3691,4502,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Waste,,,Dining Services,,"zero waste,student engagement,waste reduction",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Lotus Thai,3691,Sustainability Coordinator,Lin Tang,4502,Interim Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Closing the Loop: Building a Healthy and Sustainable Campus Food System,"California State University, Northridge (CSUN) has made remarkable changes to its food landscape in the past few years. Our campus supports and hosts multiple organic food learning gardens as well as a native plant pollinator garden that supports the important work of bees and butterflies in maintaining our food supply. The produce harvested from our gardens is donated to student volunteers, our campus Food Pantry, and local non-profits that work to feed food-insecure community members. We also offer a weekly farmers market that accepts SNAP benefits and also supports local farmers and food producers. Reducing food waste has become a major priority. To achieve this goal, a local non-profit dedicated to gleaning helps us harvest thousands of pounds of oranges from campus each year, and we have a very active chapter of the Food Recovery Network that recovers prepared foods all of our coffee shops and many restaurants on campus at the end of business days. This food is taken to community members in need. We have also implemented a food composting program that currently diverts 100% of our pre-consumer waste from the landfill, and the compost we make is used to feed the soil our food gardens, helping us close the loop in which food waste can be transformed into edible food. We're also working to reduce unnecessary single-use plastics, for example, with a 'ban the bag' initiative at all of our campus operated restaurants, have eliminating plastic straws in the Student Housing dining facility, and serve food in compostable or reusable containers with compostable cutlery. We also launched a BYOB - Bring Your Own Bottle - campaign to help educate our campus community about the free water refill stations around 'town.' We would like to share our experiences and our story to help those who wish to make change on their campus or workplace, and to hear about what more we can do!",1248,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Waste,,,,,"food systems,closed loop",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Erica Wohldmann,1248,"Interim Director, Institute for Sustainability; Professor",Sarah Johnson,1248,Sustainability Program Analyst, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9238/1430_Johnson_0577.pdf,,,
Driving Food Reconnection at Arizona State University through Collaboration between USP and Aramark,"Surveys conducted at Arizona State University dining locations indicate that the vast majority of customers care about using natural resources responsibly and make a conscious effort to only take what they can eat, yet they are not fully aware of the resources that go into food production or how their food choices impact the environment. Food reconnection at ASU begins with real nutritional food and the knowledge of its sources and impacts on the health of the planet which are fundamental to health, productivity, and connection to nature. Community gardens and gardening courses allow students to take personal ownership of a plot of land from the planting stage all the way through to harvest, with a highlight on the nutritional benefits of eating organic, seasonal produce. ASU's food service provider, Aramark partners with ASU Wellness on a weekly Meatless Monday and Carbon Footprint of food campaign in the residential restaurants to showcase the vegan Daily Root station and teach customers how to replace meat in their diets with plant-based proteins. Food Reconnection goals are present at Engrained Café, the living and learning sustainable restaurants at ASU, while urban farming through the ASU Arboretum Campus Harvest program provides students an opportunity to participate in the harvest of edible landscape from campus to be used in dining locations.

Expanding the Mission of a CanstructionU Competition to Include Partnerships for Hunger Awareness,"As part of a year-long effort to develop community partnerships themed on sustainability, Penn State Brandywine connected with the local food bank for an academic and volunteer collaboration. In the Spring 2018 semester, a kick-off event was held to generate awareness of Media Food Bank and community challenges for addressing hunger. A faculty member who addresses the scholarship of hunger and homelessness spoke to students and faculty about the importance of helping all individuals get to zero hunger, part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through one course on social media marketing, students had Media Food Bank as a client to assist them with their online marketing and promotional materials. Another course on environmental food systems formed teams to participate in the campus-wide Canstruction competition. Canstruction is a global competition that challenges teams to build structures made entirely of canned food. Although additional clubs were allowed to sign up and participate in the campus Canstruction event, the students in the environmental food systems course were required to tie in their structures with the themes of the SDGs and prepare multimedia materials to further promote awareness and education of hunger. The campus library created displays on hunger, which generated so much interest that there was new interest in our campus food pantry. All judging and voting in the competition was done electronically, while engineering students used a sustainable filament to 3-D print the awards. A campus advisory board member was brought in to speak to the students about the importance of community work in their future careers. Instead of just constructing objects from cans, we were successful as a campus crossing discipline boundaries and bringing an academic component to the competition and to assist our community partner with additional needs beyond donations.",4147,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,"competitions,hunger,food banks & pantries",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Karen Theveny,4147,"Lecturer, Communications",Laura Guertin,4147,Professor of Earth Science, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9085/1430_Theveny_0394.pdf,,,

UT Farm Stand: A Campus-Scale Model for Sustainable Food Production,"At the University of Texas, UT Farm Stand offers an innovative campus-scale model for a sustainable food production system. This student-run program depicts the unique tale of farm to market to waste within the bounds of an urban college campus, helping to bring students closer to food production and to engage in food sustainability. In two sustainable gardens, students cultivate produce which is then harvested and sold at an affordable price at a biweekly market. At the market, students purchase affordable and eco-friendly produce, volunteer to educate others about food sustainability, and learn about the impact of their food waste. UT Farm Stand enables students to engage with each step of the food production process and provides the hands-on knowledge and tools to understand the role of sustainable food production in a world of food deserts, corporate agriculture, and environmental degradation.",3049,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"campus grown foods,student engagement",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Katherine Strain,3049,Sustainability Student Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Food Service Contracts and RFPs as Vehicle for Sourcing More Sustainable Food,"College and universities need new strategies to scale sustainable food procurement. Programs like STARS and the Real Food Challenge have institutionalized sustainable food purchasing targets and many campuses have made meaningful progress toward their goals. Still, many campuses struggle to meet their goals or have plateaued in the volume of sustainable products that they purchase. Even among campuses that have had success with sustainable sourcing the majority of food still comes from industrial-scale producers that raise crops and animals using unsustainable agricultural practices. This session will present resources and case studies of universities that have used Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and foodservice contracts as a tool to increasing sustainable food sourcing. The food served in campus dining operations is sourced either by a food service management company or by campus staff through a food distributor. In both cases, campuses are often limited to purchase food available through the established supply chains of the food service management company or distributor. While some distributors and most food service management companies offer sustainable products, choices are often limited and sustainable vendors are often not included in their 'preferred' networks. In both cases contracts and RFPs offer an opportunity for universities to articulate sustainability goals, set sourcing expectations, and create accountability.",7604,4473,3995,,,,,Food & Dining,Coordination & Planning,Purchasing,,,,,"food purchasing,requests for proposals (RFPs),food service procurement",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Andrew deCorliolis,7604,Director of Policy,Samantha Lubow,4473,Enviornment Initiatives Coordinator,Michelle Smith,3995,Green Building Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7770/0915_deCorliolis_0192.pdf,,,

Leveraging Sustainability in Food Service Across Campus,"The University of Houston has undergone a physical and culture transformation with a different food service provider and new collaboration with our Office of Sustainability. In spring 2017 the Food Service Advisory committee urged the university to initiate the request for proposal process to enhance food service operations campus wide, and to include high impact sustainability initiatives. Incorporating sustainability for an institution wide contract provides leverage and influences the entire campus experience. Since the transition of our new provider we have implemented recycling in dining halls, farm to table programming, and have gained our community's attention by launching the University of Houston's first farmers market. Through our new food service partnership, the University is aggressively tackling the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals of zero hunger and responsible consumption and production. With the Office of Sustainability's support, food waste programs are now stronger and built across campus and all residential dining halls established a goal of zero waste by 2020. We have also incorporated responsible consumption and production with cage free eggs, antibiotic free chicken, milk free of artificial growth hormones, and purchasing policies aligning with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program with 100% certifiable seafood from fisheries with a commitment to responsible and environmental fishing practices. Lastly, vegetarian and vegan options have been expanded and encouraged. During our presentation we plan to educate our audience on how to leverage sustainability campus wide by providing the example of our new food service partnership. The Office of Sustainability manages the sustainability contract piece and has outlined targets and methods to achieve these goals. The presentation will discuss first steps of starting at the corporate level to implementation challenges and lessons learned to guide other institutions.",2287,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Coordination & Planning,Purchasing,,,Dining Services,,"food purchasing,requests for proposals (RFPs),food service procurement",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Gabriel Durham,2287,Sustainability Coordinator,Michael Mendoza,2287,Sustainability Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9041/1430_Mendoza_0353.pdf,,,

Estimating Greenhouse Gas and Water Reduction Through Food Labeling at a University Dining Facility,"As one of the most basic requirements for survival, food plays a massive role in how humans interact, not merely with one another, but also with the environment. The diet of an average individual encompasses the majority of their environmental footprint, where some studies suggest that diet is responsible for five thousand pounds of greenhouse gasses emitted throughout their lifetime, and 92% of their daily water consumption. With the increasing global concern for climate change and its related impacts on food production, reducing the amount of environmental burden associated with feeding the growing population is imperative. Adjustments must be made to current dietary habits to prevent further, possibly irreversible, destruction to the ecological systems that act as the foundation to the global economy. At Villanova University, through the graduate Mechanical and Sustainable Engineering programs, a life cycle analysis study has been underway of the food served at one of the campus dining facilities to develop a system of labeling that denotes the environmental burden associated with the meal options provided. Surveying was completed to get a sense of the student motivation to use environmental impact as one of the decision-making criteria when choosing their meal, including the influence on the level of accuracy of the labels. This poster illustrates some of the findings from the study, including the estimated reduction in equivalent carbon dioxide emissions and water usage.",1718,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Air & Climate,Purchasing,,,,,"food labeling,life cycle assessment",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Lucy Baron,1718,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10197/1430_Baron_1076.pdf,,,
Closing the Food Loop,"As a group of student from three different universities and a diverse range of interests, we all noticed that there were many problems with the current food system. To start, we converted a 20' by 8' shipping container into a portable aquaponics farm. By harnessing the symbiotic relationship between fish and plants we are able to use 90% less water, 70% less energy, and produce 10 times the yields as compared to conventional farming. Furthermore, this farm can be deployed anywhere to provide both food and act as a communal economic asset. After being able to produce food so efficiently, we took a step back to look at the entire food system and realized that food waste is a huge problem facing the world. Inspired by the holistic loop of aquaponics, we decided to construct an anaerobic digester which could take food waste and convert it into energy. We use this energy to sustain our farm and produce extremely nutrient rich fertilizer which can help communities grow their own food. This way we could use the waste, or end of the food system to close the loop and restart the cycle through growth.",760,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Energy,Waste,,,,,"aquaponics,food waste,closed loop",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Kareem Rabbat,760,Undergraduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9451/1430_Rabbat_0796.pdf,,,
Building a Bigger Table: Engaging Communities on Food Security,"On our campus, and in the surrounding community, there appears to be a growing urge for increased engagement and 'silo-busting.' One of the largest focal points for this is food, in particular, access to healthy, affordable food that not only nourishes our individual bodies but our communities. In this session, I will share insight on some of the silo-busting initiatives The College of Charleston has been a part of in regards to food security, both off-campus and on-campus, as a recent research initiative, the Charleston YOUth Count, has indicated 30% of our students face this issue. By the time this proposal has undergone review, numbers from the YOUth Count will in for how many youth are facing food insecurity in our county as a whole. Our Office of Sustainability will have hosted a 'Sustainability Week' in which there will be at least one brainstorming session where community stakeholders will share their ideas on how to create a more just and sustainable food system. Many of these stakeholders, such as collectivists of The Stone Soup Collective, a nonprofit with strong ties to The College of Charleston, will be a part of the newly-forming Tri-County Food Alliance, a group of nonprofit leaders, professors, community advocates, farmers, and more who are working in the areas of food justice. This work we are doing within and outside our university is ongoing and highly collaborative. In this session, I will share not only our latest initiatives, but personal insight as a faculty member, nonprofit representative, and technical associate on our triumphs and struggles on addressing the food security issues we have among and outside our college community.",5047,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Public Engagement,,,,,,"food security,community engagement",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jennifer Saunders,5047,Adjunct Professor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9373/1430_Saunders_0716.pdf,,,

Using FEEDS Communication Platform to Share Sustainability News From Dining Services,"As part of our commitment to sustainability, in October 2017 UNC Asheville Dining Services, a division of Chartwells Higher Ed, rolled out a new public communications platform called FEEDS: Farm-Forward Eating and Environmentally-Driven Sustainability. FEEDS helps diners better understand how our multi-level approach to sustainability benefits students, the greater community and the planet. Strategies include reducing pre-consumer waste, donating leftovers to our hungriest citizens, composting, weekly educational tables and partnerships across campus and beyond. UNC Asheville Dining Services strives to incorporate sustainability to the greatest extent possible, in a context where sustainability-minded students are forever wanting more. We believe it is important to think of food systems with a multidimensional approach. Therefore, we created a three-tiered classification system that identifies items as local, Carolina grown or from the Southeast. We use FEEDS as an umbrella to convey our sustainability message in one clear, concise platform. In this presentation, we will discuss how we arrived at this system, what we have learned and challenges we still face. Come learn about FEEDS and discover creative ways we express our sustainability platform, educate students and keep the movement progressing.

Increasing Local Food Procurement at Ontario's 24 Colleges,"Mohawk College executed an innovative project that proved that by sharing knowledge, resources, and solutions, together, colleges can work together to address systematic barriers to sustainability. The project, Increasing Local Food Procurement at Ontario's 24 Colleges was an 18-month project led by Mohawk College with support from the Greenbelt Fund and Ontario's Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs. The project began with in-depth research on the barriers and opportunities to local food procurement on campuses. Then, Mohawk and four partner colleges piloted solutions that directly responded to the research findings. Based on the pilot projects, research and further stakeholder consultation, Mohawk College released a Local Food Framework for Ontario's 24 Colleges in February, 2018. The Framework is a step-by-step guide to increasing the purchasing, preparation and promotion of sustainable, local foods on campus. It provides open-source tools, resources and templates that colleges can use to increase campus local food procurement. Increasing the amount of local food served on college campuses is an important opportunity for colleges to better serve their students and communities. By offering more local food options, colleges can increase student satisfaction, campus sustainability and their regional economic impact - all while increasing the quality of campus food services. In partnership with the Greenbelt Fund and the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food & Rural Affairs, Mohawk College led a research project that created a scalable, transferable framework to increase local food procurement at Ontario's 24 colleges. This project comprised of three phases: industry research; pilot projects; and a research summit - all of which contributed to the development of the Local Food Framework for Ontario Colleges.",6363,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,,,,"local foods,food purchasing",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Kate Flynn,6363,"Manager, Campus Sustainability and Climate Change", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Real Food Challenge at University of Pittsburgh,"The Real Food Challenge is a nation-wide initiative to bring local, fair, humane, and ecologically sound food to college campuses. By 2020, every participating institution aims to have 20% of their campus food be 'real.' This will effectively shift $1 billion nationwide of university food budgets away from industrial farms, overly-processed junk food, and other companies with labor/humane-practice violations. The network of students involved inspires leadership and passion for fixing a broken food system. At the University of Pittsburgh, Real Food Challenge interns commit to working toward these national goals. Some responsibilities include inputting data about purchases, calculating and analyzing the current percentage of real food in our main dining hall, and innovating unique solutions to increase this percentage without raising prices of meal plans. In the coming years, we will expand this initiative across campus and, after the goal is met by 2020, work toward 25% of food on campus being 'real' by 2025. Additionally, the Real Food Challenge Team at Pitt plans, promotes, and runs an annual event called Real Food Day to educate students on campus of our work and promote an improved food system. The goal of this event is to inform our peers, motivate them to take action, and gain support. As students, we have the right to access healthy, sustainable food on campus and the responsibility to leverage our institutions to invest in such a food system. Our poster aims to educate other students, organizations, activists, and institutions of the current problems in the food system and what can be done to start solving them. We are passionate about correcting an often unjust, inhumane, unhealthy food system and want to inspire others to do the same. As part of our poster presentation, we describe more about the Real Food Challenge and 'real food' in general, detail our efforts and goals, and explain how we can all contribute to bettering a food system in need.",760,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,,,,,,real food,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Zoë Neal,760,Undergraduate Student,Rosemary Holtz,760,Undergraduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Green Dining at Georgia State University,"Georgia State's insourced dining services, PantherDining, continues to impress and promote sustainability throughout campus. With the help from the Student Sustainability Fee Fund, PantherDining recently launched Freight Farms' Leafy Green Machine to begin growing produce that will be served in the dining halls- the ultimate farm-to-table experience for the Georgia State community. Furthermore, two of the University's dining halls were given the very first 3-star green certification in the south based on the categories of disposables, energy, food, furnishings and building materials, pollution and chemical reduction, and waste and water usage by the National Restaurant Association. In addition to the fantastic work of university dining staff, Georgia State students recently created a Panther Food Recovery Network where they collect surplus food from the dining halls and donate to local charities. This is the first food recovery chapter in Georgia. Just this year, the Panther Food Recovery Network has recovered and donated over 5,000 pounds of food, enough to feed 3,000 people! During this session, presenters will take a deeper dive into the benefits and challenges of all of the efforts listed above as well as resources saved.

Using Catering to Create a Virtuous Cycle of Sustainability in Your Community,"Sustainability practitioners are constantly grappling with the hard questions: How to overcome inertia of the status quo? How to get others to adopt change? How to get businesses that could face slightly increased costs to care? How to get the for-profit sector to participate in the exciting movements coming from college and university campuses? This university and catering management company found answers through aligned incentives and by driving business to vendors who have committed to helping the university achieve its sustainable food and zero landfill waste goals. This session follows the popular 2017 session by demonstrating how contracted caterers are incentivized to make sustainability commitments, how event planners know which caterers align with the university's sustainability goals, and how both parties benefit. The session focuses on results for how the program has influenced participation levels of caterers serving the university, how caterers and event planners engage on sustainability, and how this initiative enhances the intersections between sustainability and the institutional community through engaging with suppliers on food purchased and waste produced at catered events. Presenters will also demonstrate the enhanced online ordering platform that communicates the university's sustainability goals, places icons next to caterers that support these goals, and allows customers to filter for caterers designated with a sustainability icon.",8304,3931,,,,,,Food & Dining,Waste,,,,Dining Services,,catering,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Rob Lebowitz,8304,Chief Operating Officer,Kelly Weisinger,3931,Sustainability Staff, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10459/1400_Weisinger_0997.pdf,,,
How to Get Reusable Dining Containers on Your Campus!,"Many campuses serve food at dining locations in single-use plastics. These plastics may be recyclable, but unfortunately, these containers are rarely cleaned. As a result, the recycling is contaminated. In order to prevent the waste of single-use plastics, Northern Arizona University's Green Fund has implemented the O2GO program on their campus. Five dining locations in the University Union serve food for students in the container that can be reused an infinite amount of times. The Green Fund paid for the machine and containers, while campus dining runs the program. Some small universities across the campus have this program, but Northern Arizona University is the largest university in the United States. This workshop will teach students about how the Green Fund pursued the project, partnered with campus dining, and implemented the program. The presenters will also discuss the problems with the program and how universities can overcome those problems.",567,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Waste,,,,,,"reuse,waste reduction,reusable containers",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Chandler McCormick,567,Undergraduate Student,Gabriela Galvan,567,Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Food Recovery and Partnership Models,"The University of Utah is collaborating to address seven of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals on on-campus, in local communities, as well as throughout the state. While working to reduce food waste, food is diverted to food insecure members of our communities through coordination of efforts with Salt Lake City's Sustainability Department, State and County Health Departments, local food pantries, food services like restaurants and caterers, local home gardeners, community garden nonprofit organizations, and more. The University of Notre Dame is collaborating with nonprofits and two student groups to prevent food waste from the dining halls, Au Bon Pain and catered events. One glaring issue remained: Athletics food waste. That food now goes to Cultivate Culinary, a local non-profit culinary school that gives job training to cooks who prepare meals with rescued food. Most of the trainees represent at-risk individuals in the community. Students from the University of Pittsburgh student group Food Recovery Heroes began recovering surplus food from campus dining facilities in 2014 when they realized the food that was being thrown away at the end of the day was perfectly edible and that neighbors in the community needed food donations. A partnership with local food rescue organization 412 Food Rescue developed soon after to ensure food was reaching people outside of traditional food donation spaces such as residents of Housing Authority communities.",3994,3704,3600,8617,,,,Food & Dining,Public Engagement,,,,,,"food waste,food recovery",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Nick Knight,3994,Student,Shannon Jones,3994,Associate Instructor/Project Lead,Charles Allen,3704,Sustainability Program Manager,Nick Goodfellow,3600,Sustainability Coordinator,Jennifer England,8617,Program Director, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9760/0915_Goodfellow.pdf,,,
"Campus Grown: Connecting Sustainability, Local Food Systems, and Experiential Student Learning","When farms, gardens, and other agricultural production takes place on college campuses those spaces can serve as hubs for sustainability education, local food systems, and transformative student learning. In this session you will hear from representatives from Penn State and UNC Chapel Hill, who will each describe some of the unique aspects of their 'campus grown' programs, and how they are using their programs to model innovative approaches to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Attendees will hear about Edible Campus UNC, a student-initiated program of the North Carolina Botanical Garden that creates working landscapes across the university campus that grow edible, medicinal, and pollinator-friendly plants, and the Penn State Student Farm, a one acre site for community and campus engagement, sustainable food systems, and unique learning models.",4238,4190,,,,,,Food & Dining,,,,,,,"local foods,food systems,experiential learning,campus grown foods",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Laura Mindlin,4238,Edible Campus UNC Coordinator,Whitney Ashead,4190,Director of Campus Outreach for the Student Farm Club at Penn State, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9786/1445_Mindlin.pdf,,,
Lettuce Talk: Students and Dining Staff Collaborating on Plant-Based Dining,"Plant-based diets can be healthier and more sustainable than meat-centric diets but plant-based options in college dining halls often fail to be crave-worthy. At the University of Pittsburgh dining halls, Sodexo works closely with student diners who are leading the plant-based charge to improve options on campus. The Veg Collective is a group of students (some vegan, some vegetarian, and some omnivores) and Sodexo staff who meet regularly to discuss plant-based dining options on campus including ways to improve them and to educate diners about the importance of eating a plant-based diet for your health and the environment. The partnership has produced significant changes to campus dining including the addition of two 100% plant-based (vegan) stations in the main dining halls as well as dozens of plant-based options added to locations across campus. Through this presentation we'll share the argument for why it's important to promote a plant-based diet and offer plant-based options in dining halls, how students and dining staff at the University of Pittsburgh worked to get where we're at now, and where we're heading.",3600,760,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,,,,Dining Services,,"plant-based foods,vegan & vegetarian dining",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Nick Goodfellow,3600,Sustainability Coordinator,Lisa Beilman,760,Nutrition Intern,Bridget Trimble,760,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9679/1130_Goodfellow.pdf,,,
Put Your Fork Where Your Ethics Are: Exploring Food Systems & Leveraging University Purchasing Power,"Do you support climate change? What about modern-day slavery? You don't have to answer that, the food that you buy already does. Worldwide, food is an essential commodity that goes through an entire infrastructure of production, processing, packaging, transportation, storage, and sales. At each step, it can contribute to environmental degradation and human rights violations. Consumer demand and spending can either support or disrupt this system. How do we vote with our dollars every day when we choose what food to buy? As students, we are members of an institution that purchases food for hundreds or thousands of people each day. We have the power to make a difference in where that food comes from. We have the power to leverage the purchasing power of universities to support a better food system. In this introductory workshop, we will delve into what the food system is and how it affects the environment, farmers and farmworkers, up to the consumers. Universities play a significant role in the local, national, and global food system. We will discuss how the purchases universities make can affect our food system for better or for worse, how students can advocate a more sustainable food system on their campuses, and organizations that support students to do so. As an illustrative example, we will present a short case study for a specific product shift Johns Hopkins University has made to source their food more ethically.",515,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,,,,"food purchasing,food systems,ethics",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Bela Garces,515,Undergraduate Student,Katie Smith,515,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8607/1015_Garces_0980.pdf,,,
Big Food in our Universities: Exploring the Ties Between Institutions and Big Food Corporations,"Our universities and higher education institutions have the power and duty to be at the forefront of the movement for a more just and sustainable food system. So why is it that the incredible initiatives and efforts of students and other campus advocates are still not the norm at our universities? Why does it feel like we are making such slow progress? In this workshop, we will explore the public and covert relationships big food corporations have with our institutions, whether in university dining, research, education, or funding, and how these relationships impact the roles our institutions play in transforming our food system. We will also explore the role students can play in influencing our campuses as agents of change in the food system.",6891,,,,,,,Food & Dining,,,,,,,food systems,10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Dominique Fahmy,6891,Research and Projects Fellow,Clarissa Chen,6891,"Undergraduate Student, Public Health", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Grounds for Change: Electrifying CSUN's Landscaping Equipment,"Driven by CSUN's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality, Facilities Planning staff worked with The University's Grounds Shop to test and purchase electric string trimmers, leaf blowers and a riding lawnmower to replace their gasoline-powered counterparts. In addition to eliminating the emissions associated with gas-powered equipment, the electric replacements produce significantly less noise, fumes and vibration, resulting in safer operation for their users and less disruption to the campus. The equipment is also charged using trailers outfitted with solar panels and battery storage, making their operation completely carbon-neutral.

Leadership in Sustainable Grounds Management: The Audubon International Experience,"This presentation will provide an open dialogue and best practice sharing on the process of achieving Audubon International's (AI) Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Program (ACSP) certification at both public and private, post-secondary institutions in Canada and the United States. Through award-winning environmental education, technical assistance, certification, and recognition, AI has facilitated the implementation of natural resource management practices on campuses that ensure land, water, wildlife, and other natural resources are sustainably used and conserved. AI has enrolled over 3,000 properties (including golf courses, industrial lands, ski areas, housing developments, farms, resorts, and college campuses) and communities in its rigorous certification programs. A panel made up of American University, the University of Florida, and Niagara College Canada (all ASCP certified institutions) will provide case studies of how AI is able to help public and private colleges and universities conserve and restore wildlife habitat, water, energy and other natural resources while engaging the community and other partners in these efforts. This approach to environmental management encourages continuous program improvement, as progress reporting is required to maintain certification. It also ensures that landscape and sustainability managers engage the campus community in education, monitoring and management activities that promote awareness.",5880,7415,2613,2088,,,,Grounds,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"landscaping,third party certifications",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Amber Schmucker,5880,Sustainability Engagement Officer,Jessica Latus,7415,Director of Sustainable Community Programs,Stephanie DeStefano,2613,Grounds Operations Manager,Matthew Williams,2088,"Director, Office of Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7927/0915_Latus_0352.pdf,,,
"Overcoming Obstacles When Establishing Intentional, Productive Urban Campus Green Spaces: Natural and Man-made Challenges","In April 2016, Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), an urban research university in downtown Richmond, VA, created an on-campus Learning Garden. Urban campus gardens can face a unique set of challenges - both natural and man-made - because of location and surrounding environment. During this session, the VCU Learning Garden Coordinator, along with the co-presenter, Director of Sustainability for VCU, will describe hindrances to the success of the newly-established campus Learning Garden, share strategies to address these obstacles, and identify how these strategies can potentially work for other urban campus gardens. Presenters will also discuss VCU's community garden, living plant wall, student housing green spaces, and a future sustainability-themed campus pocket park. Presenters will focus on the following topics: 1) Creating a garden space that looks defined and intentional, but is still accessible to students and the community. 2) Creating biodiversity and implementing crop rotation in a space flanked by hardscape and man-made structures. 3) Balancing sustainability goals with garden safety concerns when the two do not align. 4) Leveraging existing student interest to create more support from the student body. Attendees seeking to create an urban campus garden will gain insight into potential challenges and can use this insight to better plan their garden. Attendees managing existing garden spaces can acquire new strategies to address obstacles.",1546,,,,,,,Grounds,Campus Engagement,Food & Dining,,,,,gardens,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Sara Barton,1546,Learning Garden Coordinator,Erin Stanforth,1546,Director of Sustainability, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10278/1445_Stanforth_0598.pptx,,,
Supporting Sustainability Education and Biodiversity Through Grounds Management,"For the last 3 years, AASHE Sustainable Campus Index has recognized SUNY Cortland as top performing in the grounds category. This poster will highlight the variety of methods we use to support sustainability education and biodiversity through management of our campus grounds. SUNY Cortland encompasses nearly 800 acres of land with nearly 600 dedicated and devoted for outdoor educational opportunities and the preservation of natural areas and biodiversity. At our main campus, we have incorporated bioswales planted with native species, model gardens, and a growing edible forest and orchard based on permaculture principles. These efforts have resulted in not the marginalization of model gardens, or campus orchard efforts, but brought them directly to the center of campus where most students and staff cross daily. SUNY Cortland has strong engagement from the grounds department which support sustainability and biodiversity efforts through Integrated Pest Management, use of native plant species, care and support of existing campus trees and establishing no mow zones. This strong engagement has brought about summer maintenance opportunities for student employment to maintain the biodiversity in our bioswales, campus gardens and edible forest garden. In addition, there is much involvement from other staff, faculty and students through the Campus Garden /Bee Campus USA Committee which initiated and manage the campus model garden and established SUNY Cortland as a Bee Campus. The Tree Campus USA Committee works closely with the grounds staff in managing and keeping track of our campus trees, in establishing a tree replacement plan, and in diversifying the types of trees on campus, and works closely with the local community including conducting tree canopy assessments. All of these aspects provide a healthier campus and community, provide models for our local community on grounds management strategies and provide tremendous education opportunities for our students.",1427,,,,,,,Grounds,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"gardens,landscaping,Tree Campus USA",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Matthew Brubaker,1427,Campus Energy Manager,Beth Klein,1427,Professor and Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10402/1430_Brubaker_1102.pdf,,,
Pollinator Protection: Save the Monarch Butterfly!,"This poster will describe the process Central Community College uses to engage students in the support of pollinators, particularly the Monarch butterfly. Furthermore, basic information regarding Monarch butterfly behavior and research will be conveyed. CCC, as a Bee Campus USA institution and participant in Monarch Watch, actively engages students, faculty, staff, and community members in protecting pollinators. Media accounts of declining numbers of Monarch butterflies have alerted many institutional stakeholders to the importance of Monarch butterfly research and preservation. CCC's efforts to maintain pollinator gardens on our all three campuses, grow multiple varieties of milkweed, capture and purchase caterpillars, and release tagged adults has received significant attention on campus and in the community. It is hoped that sharing this information with an AASHE audience will further enhance efforts to understand and save the Monarch butterfly.",4372,,,,,,,Grounds,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,"pollinators,butterflies",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Brent Adrian,4372,Instructor of Communication, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10226/1430_Adrian_1079.pdf,,,
Rising to the Global Biodiversity Challenge: A New Model at the University of British Columbia (UBC),"With the world's 6th mass extinction underway, we are in the midst of a critical historical juncture. In a time characterized by rampant urbanization, climate change and disconnection between citizens and the environment - the need for biodiversity conservation, engagement and enhancement has never been more critical. At the University of British Columbia (UBC), a new cutting-edge model - the Campus Biodiversity Initiative: Research and Demonstration (CBIRD) serves as an innovative incubator for advancing biodiversity. CBIRD is the first campus-wide initiative of its kind in Canada, through utilizing the Campus as a Living Laboratory is an innovative hub connecting academics, practitioners and the wider community in collaborative applied research to advance biodiversity. The vision of CBIRD is to cultivate innovative ideas, research and actions to inform biodiversity policies and practice at our campus and in wider regions. Key values of CBIRD include: Interdisciplinary, whole-systems and action-orientated approach, scalability and replicability. Applying a radially organized framework, an interdisciplinary committee and framework serves as a 'hub' to guide and support a series of 'satellite' Campus as Living Lab projects which inform the development of emerging biodiversity plans and policies. Embedded within UBC's internationally recognized award winning SEEDS Sustainability Program, CBIRD represents a new innovative model in SEEDS with more than 8000 participants.",2242,,,,,,,Grounds,Curriculum,Research,,,,,"biodiversity,living labs",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Liska Richer,2242,Manager,John Madden,2242,Director Sustainability and Engineering, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8203/1045_Richer_0603.pdf,,,
Great Gardening Goals: Aligning WMU's Gibbs Permaculture Site With the UN's SDGs,"At the Western Michigan University Gibbs Site, the Office for Sustainability demonstrates permaculture techniques, and researches the validity of those techniques, while repairing damaged land, building soil carbon, increasing biodiversity, collecting water, and providing a sustainable food source for the humans and non-humans that benefit from the site. Many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are addressed at the Gibbs Site-we describe alignment with: 'Zero Hunger,' 'Quality Education,' 'Good Health and Well-being,' 'Sustainable Cities and Communities' and 'Life on Land.' Techniques demonstrated on site provide an educational alternative to the industrial agricultural model. However, the site's function is not confined to the 2 acre site-we argue that permaculture principles can help achieve each of the 17 SDGs in some capacity. We will provide several examples such as our food forest which contains over 100 varieties of different edible and non-edible plants and was designed from the perspective of the permaculture principle 'use and value diversity.' The idea of the food forest is to mimic natural systems in order to create a resilient and thriving ecosystem. A natural ecosystem contains thousands of interconnected species that all support one another-our food forest includes edible and useful plants that are beneficial to all forms of life. This dynamic network of biota is essential for providing sustained and reliable food production aligned with the SDGs.",1817,,,,,,,Grounds,Food & Dining,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),permaculture,gardens",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Molly Smucker,1817,"Student, Office of Sustainability",Helene Woyczesczyk,1817,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8348/0830_Smucker_0723.pdf,,,
Native Food Garden in the Sonoran Desert,"Since July 2017, I began volunteering at The Desert Research Learning Center (DLRC). The DRLC is owned by the National Park Service and is located adjacent to the east district of Saguaro National Park in Tucson, Arizona. The Sonoran Desert Network provides research vital for conservation to 11 different National Park Service units in Arizona and New Mexico that are relatively small and were established primarily to protect cultural resources. Besides monitoring and collecting innovatory, the DRLC aims to create a showcase of desert environment and demonstrate the kinds of sustainable practices that can help to maintain and restore life in arid lands. I am involved with their new garden project which is a variety of fall and spring crops that demonstrate sustainable gardening methods, techniques for starting a garden in Arizona, and native practices used by ancestors in Southern Arizona. The garden offers guests with a hands on learning experience in history, sustainability, and science. The DLRC also receives volunteers from the community and the University of Arizona to assist with planting, harvesting, and plant removal. The garden is watered by a drip irrigation and a rainwater collection system. Pests are controlled by the use of Neem oil. One-hundred percent organic compost was added to the soil to add nutrients and reduce pH and salinity in the desert soils. Traditional techniques in the garden included a clay watering method (Olla), the 'Three Sisters' technique, as well as growing traditional nutrient-rich foods like Tepary beans and Chiltapeans. I am so honored to be a lead in this project. I love finding ways to involve the community and I believe it is very important for everyone to learn where their food comes from. I, myself have also learned so much due to researching and designing a garden that started as a weed infested field.",4465,,,,,,,Grounds,Public Engagement,,,,,,gardens,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Megan Gaul,4465,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

Solutions for Evaluating Projects: Quadruple Bottom Line & Financial Models for Climate Neutrality,"It's time to move the conversation beyond 'financing climate neutrality.' In order to move away from traditional financial, single bottom line decision making for large capital investments, institutions must create and integrate new valuation tools which elevate climate neutrality and sustainability decision making alongside traditional financial models. Cornell University has adopted a 'quadruple bottom line' sustainability decision making framework which advances a model for People, Prosperity, Planet, and Purpose (academic mission and living laboratory potential) for use in project approval processes, capital planning, and project decision making at all levels. First used successfully in a comparison of 10 major investments for heating and powering a carbon neutral campus, the QBL framework is now being integrated into formal decision making processes across the campus from building design and construction to human resource management. This session will cover the QBL framework creation process, it's implementation for climate neutrality project financing, and the suite of tools developed by Cornell for integrated QBL into business decision making at all levels.

Celebrating Anniversaries: Reflecting and Adapting within Campus Green Funds,"Adaptability is key for any successful program. In spring of 2016, students renewed The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) at UC Berkeley for an additional 10 years, celebrating 10 years of a successful green fund program since its founding in 2007. A year later, in 2017, the Student Environmental Resource Center (SERC) celebrated its 5-year anniversary offering support, advising, resources and direction to campus sustainability efforts. Join UC Berkeley's TGIF Coordinator and SERC Director (also a former TGIF Coordinator) in this session of reflection, best practices, and challenges faced in each program, with a focus on TGIF. TGIF will share how it has adapted and helped support campus sustainability goals and initiatives by providing $2.5 million in funding for students, staff and faculty to realize over 180 sustainability projects, while SERC will share how it has become the departmental home for TGIF. Where one problem is solved, another is created. With plans to continue funding campus sustainability efforts through the year 2027, TGIF will share how it has begun evaluating its operations and impact through a workgroup of key stakeholders and developing a recommendations document to bolster the program moving forward. TGIF will also share some of its 'firsts' for the UC Berkeley campus, or initiatives that have grown into full-fledged, institutionally-recognized programs and services. With plans to open a physical center in the campus student union building in fall 2018, SERC will share its methods of strategic planning and how to prepare for gauging student community input to offer the most desirable and best resources for the environmental sustainability community on campus.

Moving Toward Climate Justice Through Divestment and Reinvestment,"All colleges have an endowment that they use to invest in a broad range of industries. Divestment is a powerful tactic where institutions can use their political and financial power to target the financial stability and social capital of companies profiting from injustice. Since 2011, the fossil fuel divestment movement has been taking root on campuses across the world, calling attention to the climate crisis and the role of the fossil fuel industry in causing this crisis. The movement has mobilized thousands of students to take action, and to date, over 140 colleges across the world have committed to fossil fuel divestment. It remains the fastest growing student movement in history. We will discuss the underlying moral and political arguments behind divestment, the basic financial considerations, the movement's current direction in centering climate justice and reinvestment, and go over a 'how-to' for a campaign. Participants will receive resource materials to help them start campaigns of their own and will be plugged into the national campus fossil fuel divestment network.

Aligning Endowment Investments With the Sustainable Development Goals,"The past few years have seen a surge in interest and activity around how endowment investment practices can be better aligned with institutional mission, values, and sustainability goals. Endowment decision-makers are increasingly looking for opportunities to align investments with sustainability goals and shift capital to sustainability solutions. One strategy is for university endowments to align their portfolios with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) -- a growing trend among investment managers worldwide. The SDGs provide a compelling framework to contextualize the sustainability leadership of American colleges and universities. This session will include a moderated discussion among leaders in the higher ed sustainability movement, senior administrators, and investment professionals about how the SDGs can serve as a framework for endowment investing. Through facilitated dialogue exercises, participants of this session will share where their institutions stand in terms of sustainable endowment investing, learn how to leverage this framework to enhance endowment investing, and be invited to join and help shape the future of the Intentional Endowments Network.",8634,7689,,,,,,Investment & Finance,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),endowment",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Meggin Thwing Eastman,8634,"Vice President, Head of Impact and Screening Research",Lisa Hayles,7689,Boston Common Asset Management,Kaede Kawauchi,7689,Program Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Advocating for Sustainability: Effective Communications With Finance,"This session is designed to help sustainability professionals advocate successfully for necessary financial support for sustainability initiatives. For many years the National Association for College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) has encouraged investments in sustainable college campuses, and each year campuses add to a growing list of significant achievements ranging from converting to sustainable energy sources to net zero buildings and more. Yet short term financial pressures on institutions can make it difficult to obtain funds for sustainability initiatives. Infiltration of the finance office is key to establishing numerous sustainability goals and obtaining funding to achieve those goals. Hear how campuses have improved their physical plant operations and increased investments in sustainability initiatives. Learn how to communicate with your business office using their language and by using sustainable principles to address their challenges. Note there are different processes and paths to achieving success. Evaluate your own campus leadership hierarchy to maneuver to the best possible solutions. NACUBO representative will present information how other campuses have forged success to advance a myriad of sustainability efforts. a university sustainability manager will provide their on-the-ground perspective.",2385,4368,,,,,,Investment & Finance,,,,,,,funding,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Sally Grans Korsh,2385,"Director, Facilities Management & Environmental Policy",Chris Steuer,4368,Sustainability Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7864/0915_GransKorsh_0282_1001_093949.pptx,,,
Student Green Funds: Lessons Learned,"Three campuses will share their experiences creating and working with Green Funds. The panel will review key lessons learned regarding Green Fund structure, function, efficacy, longevity and campus engagement. When the University of Nebraska-Lincoln established a green fund the structure seemed to be an innovative means of creating a green fund in a politically conservative climate. However, two years later the structure has created challenges affecting its success. Learn key structural components that will help make the operation of your green fund successful from the start. UIUC will explore how student-driven green fund projects build a conscientious community focused on environmental stewardship. We will provide examples of green fund projects that have positively altered the sustainability discussion at UIUC and facilitate a discussion about promoting conscientious behavior. Southern Oregon University will discuss the challenges and benefits of using a green fund to support multi-year projects. They will also review how to solicit diverse projects and how to transition projects to be institutionalized to promote greater impact and longevity.",3610,4308,1628,,,,,Investment & Finance,Campus Engagement,,,,,,green funds,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Cale Brodersen,3610,Sustainability Staff,Cathy Liebowitz,4308,Student Sustainability Committee Coordinator,Lindsay Swanson,1628,Director of Sustainability,Roxane Beigel-Coryell,1628,Sustainability & Recycling Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9785/0915_BeigelCoryell.pdf,,,
All We Need is Political Will: Empowering Students on Civic Engagement on Climate Change,"At this critical time in our nation's history, the need to transition to a clean energy economy and a just and equitable society is more urgent than ever. Young people can play a critical role in building political will for policies that create a sustainable future. Citizens' Climate Education is a national, nonprofit organization dedicated to building political will for climate solutions by enabling breakthroughs in the exercise of individual and political power. Its consistently respectful, non-partisan approach to climate education is designed to create a broad, sustainable foundation for climate action across all geographic regions and political inclinations. By building upon shared values rather than partisan divides, and empowering our supporters to work in keeping with the concerns of their local communities, we work towards the adoption of fair, effective, and sustainable climate change solutions. CCE works with students through the Campus Leaders Program, which trains students in organizing and lobbying skills to advocate for carbon pricing, and our higher ed allies conduct outreach at hundreds of colleges and universities to harness the voice of higher education for climate solutions. This panel will feature faculty, and staff students that have worked with CCE to share best practices and lessons learned in working with students on civic engagement on climate change.",7760,2782,2203,760,,,,Public Engagement,Air & Climate,Campus Engagement,,,,,"civic engagement,climate change",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Clara Fang,7760,Higher Education Outreach Coordinator,Debra Rowe,2782,President,Sharon Yohn,2203,Assistant Professor of Chemistry,Samuel Ressin,760,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8390/1445_Fang_0783.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8391/1445_Rowe_0783.pptx,,
Climate Memes: Undergraduates Making Climate Data Go Viral,"On Earth Day 2017, Climatepedia boothed in Pershing Square at the March for Science-Los Angeles. Students from the University of California, Irvine branch of the organization displayed their signs at the booth, along with information on climate change. The most popular signs were those with memes, which were viewed by thousands of people at the march. Memes are a form of imagery that have become increasingly prevalent in today's culture because they are relatable and easily shareable. Undergraduate students from Climatepedia realized that memes were an ideal medium to spread the word about the scientific consensus on climate change, as well as communicate the risks and consequences of issue to the millennial generation. Thus, Climatepedia students launched a meme page on Instagram. According to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, less than 50% percent of adults in America discuss climate change at least occasionally. Memes are a simple, culturally relevant, and humorous way to bring light to climate change. Memes provide context quick in ways that regular images cannot, making their messages more effective. Through this project, students involved with Climatepedia are working on their own climate literacy. As part of their own climate literacy training, they find charts, graphs, and data online that they believe should be shared. The meme page serves as a stepping stone to expose people to climate-related information.",4502,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Air & Climate,Campus Engagement,,,,,"climate change,memes,communications",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Gianna Lum,4502,"Undergraduate Student, Earth System Science",Patricia Haigh,4502,Undergraduate, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7839/0830_Lum_0245.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7839/0830_Lum_0245.pdf,,
Community Outreach on Steroids: Impacting People in 8 Counties While Recruiting Great Students,"In June 2017, Slippery Rock University's Office of Sustainability launched the 'Healthy Planet, Healthy People Environmental Summer Camp and Community Project Incubator'. The focus of this program was to create a ripple effect of environmental awareness, education and stewardship action in local communities, while also recruiting high school students passionate about sustainability. This case study details an innovative way in which colleges and universities can work with high schools and environmental organizations to develop authentic experiences that foster a genuine desire among students to engage in addressing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) within their communities. By engaging these students in a local environmental project of their own design, teachers and students were involved in addressing 11 of the 17 SDGs. At the start of the project, 12 teams of high school teachers and students from 8 different counties came together to attend a week-long summer camp held on SRU's campus. During the camp, the teams participated in leadership training, immersive field experiences and collaborative project planning sessions. Camp staff, environmental professionals, and university faculty then mentored each team as they completed their project plan. Project plans included a budget, a management plan, a timeline, and team assignments. Each team left the camp with a high level of confidence that they could successfully carry out their projects.",4704,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"project based learning,student recruitment,Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Christine McHenry-Glenn,4704,Sustainability Staff,Paul Scanlon,4704,Director of Sustainability, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8137/0915_McHenryGlenn_0538.pdf,,,
Learning from our Future: Engaging Youth in Climate Justice,"How do we build a truly inclusive climate justice movement that values every voice and experience? Engage young people. They have a lot to say, and are eager to say it. In 2016, the University at Buffalo co-hosted an event that brought seventy youth between the ages of 12-21 from all over Western New York together at an interactive forum specifically focused on climate justice. These young people had a dialogue on climate change and how it has impacted their lives. They had a frank and honest conversation that answered critical questions on the current conditions of Western New York pertaining to social justice, the Black Lives Matter movement, and climate change. After an afternoon of communication and relationship building, the youth participants and adult facilitators were energized about future possibilities working in the climate justice movement together. They formed a committee and are currently building on the momentum that was created two years ago. This interactive session will discuss the tactics and tips that higher education can use to meaningfully engage diverse youth that live in communities that will be unequally impacted by climate change. You will hear from some of the youths' experiences first hand on how they have worked with the community, not as tokens, but as powerful leaders.",1306,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Air & Climate,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,"youth,climate change,environmental justice",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Derek Nichols,1306,Sustainability Engagement Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9096/1430_Nichols_0403.pdf,,,
"UC3: The Research University's Role in Place-Based, Cross-Sector Climate Action","The University Climate Change Coalition, or UC3, is a coalition of 13 leading North American research universities that are prototyping a collaborative model designed to help local communities achieve their climate goals and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future. In launching UC3, an initial cohort of distinguished universities from the United States, Canada and Mexico has committed to mobilize their resources and expertise to accelerate local and regional climate action in partnership with businesses, cities and states. UC3 operates in close partnership with Second Nature's Climate Leadership Network, a group of hundreds of colleges and universities that have committed to taking action on climate. Every UC3 institution will hold a climate change forum in 2018 to bring together community and business leaders, elected officials and other local stakeholders. Meetings will be tailored to meet local and regional objectives shared across sectors and will aim to accelerate the implementation of research-driven climate policies and climate solutions. In a moderated panel discussion format, UC3 representatives will discuss the outcomes from their respective forums, including lessons from both the process as well as the climate prioirities that emerged.

Climate Lab: Taking the Gloom out of the Doom,"Let's face it - thinking about climate change and sustainability - and what to do about these pressing issues - can be downright depressing. People don't want to hear about starving polar bears on melting ice floes or feel guilty about how their deleterious habits are affecting the environment. So, the University of California's Marketing Communications team, in collaboration with Vox Media, took an innovative approach: just own up to this 'elephant in the room' and break down overwhelming topics into very relatable, short segments designed to engage and inspire viewers into action. Each of Climate Lab's nine, highly-produced videos challenge conventional storytelling tropes about global warming and offer viewers palatable solutions to monumental problems. Hosted by Conservation International CEO and UC alumni, Dr. M. Sanjayan, the videos were widely recognized for their creative and positive approach. https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/climate-lab",4144,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Air & Climate,,,,,,"videos,climate change",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Larissa Branin,4144,Multimedia Director,Matthew St.Clair,4144,Director of Sustainability, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Urban Forestry and Community Engagement - the Chemis-tree of Successful Partnerships,"Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) is an urban research university located in downtown Richmond, Virginia. With greenhouse gas mitigation goals looming, VCU established the VCU Urban Forestry Collaborative (VUFC) - a unique example of university climate action through asset-based community development. This innovative program provides a model for a) quantitative community-based research in an urban environment b) developing and sustaining university-community partnerships, and c) achieving tangible outcomes that address community and university goals. This session will provide an overview VUFC program goals and objectives and our process for developing and sustaining partnerships that facilitate innovative work. The role a sustainability office or officer plays in facilitating such partnerships will also be discussed. The session will focus around: Research: How we are leveraging GIS and iTree to establish a carbon sequestration baseline and quantify the ecosystem services value for every public street tree in our partner neighborhood and evaluate the distribution of tree canopy between neighborhoods in the City of Richmond. Engagement: How we are translating our research findings so that a) our community partners will have tools to lobby the city for public tree program funding, and b) neighborhood residents can better understand the economic, ecological, and social value of public street trees.

"How Higher Ed Helps Enact Tomorrow's Climate Change Legislation, Today!","New York City is poised to enact the world's most sweeping climate change legislation, based on the innovation, validation, and support of higher education. How did NYU lead in making this landmark legislation possible? And how can your institution do the same? Examples will include: 1) Long-term planning: Universities invest in energy savings as proving grounds for carbon commitments and reduction. Who should this information be shared with to influence local climate policy? 2) Research: Cities don't perform original research, so university departments from Engineering to Planning can lay the groundwork for impactful, evidence-based policy. How can government and research be connected? 3) Scale: Campuses are cities in miniature, and thus guide policies that affect the real estate industry. How can universities exert influence in this realm? With NYU at the forefront, higher ed has led the way in pushing NYC towards landmark climate policy. In this session, we're going to share our experiences, things we learned, and have an open discussion about how the work might translate elsewhere. Participate in the discussion of how your institution's focus on climate change and social justice can not only help local governments improve policy, but give students, frustrated with a lack of federal policy progress, a chance to get involved.",2138,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Buildings,Research,,,,,"climate policy,advocacy",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Cecil Scheib,2138,Assistant Vice President for Sustainability, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10015/0830_Scheib_0242.pdf,,,
"Co-Designing a Sustainable, Native American Cultural Center with the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate","Public engagement is a crucial way for higher education institutions to align their teaching and research activities around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This case study examines how an interdisciplinary University of Virginia research team of faculty and students is collaborating with the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate (SWO) to design a sustainable Cultural Center on the tribe's Lake Traverse Reservation in South Dakota. Working with SWO tribal members, the Nis'to native non-profit organization, and the Sisseton Wahpeton Tribal College, this publicly engaged sustainability research combines scholarly and creative methods to propose programs, architecture, and landscapes to support traditional and contemporary Dakotah culture, including visual arts, dance, music, theater, culinary arts and agriculture.

Community Impacts Through Energy-Efficient Housing Education,"The Energy Efficient Housing Research Group (EEHR), an outreach arm of the Hamer Center for Community Design, is a conduit between high-performance housing research and housing stakeholders. EEHR connects multidisciplinary students and faculty from across Penn State with community partners in Pennsylvania through engaged-scholarship projects to advance the research, design, and implementation of energy efficient homes. EEHR has three iterative and interrelated aims: Design Innovation, Evaluation, and Education and Engagement of 'responsible housing'-housing that is affordable, sustainable, and healthful. In addition to housing research, EEHR has facilitated the University's Race to Zero team in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center. For this Department of Energy sponsored collegiate competition, students from across the university work collaboratively to design and document a zero-energy ready home. In each of the five years of the competition, Penn State has partnered with a local affordable housing organization to inform the site and context for the project. The result of this partnership elevates the educational experience by providing a 'real-world' project while also allowing students to inform the housing organizations about appropriate high-performance design practices and building science. With the added goal of designing with a local client, students are also able to have a lasting impact in the Penn State area, such as with the construction of the GreenBuild duplex in the State College Borough, a set of two attached high-performance homes modeled after the 2015 Penn State Race to Zero project submission. This presentation will examine the work and research done by EEHR through engaged-scholarship projects and competitions like the Race to Zero and how EEHR is able to create real change through student and housing stakeholder education throughout Pennsylvania.",4190,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,Energy,,,,,"housing,energy efficiency",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Christopher Hazel,4190,Energy Efficient Housing Researcher, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Mapping our Participation in the United Nations Global Compact: Storytelling and Sustainability,"As a participant of the U.N. Global Compact, the State University College of New York at Geneseo uses the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals as a framework to talk about our local and global sustainability efforts. As members of the President's Sustainability Commission for Geneseo, we came up with an innovative way to organize our efforts and communicate them with the public. We are using ArcGIS to tell the comprehensive story of how the college and its faculty, alumni and students are leading sustainability efforts - on campus, regionally and throughout the world. Our interactive storytelling map addresses each of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals and the difference our efforts are making. (www.geneseo.edu/sustainability) This unique tool has allowed us to effectively catalogue our efforts as well as educate our stakeholders, students, faculty and staff on the breadth of what working towards a sustainable world really looks like. This session will focus on how we developed the map, how we organized content according to each Sustainable Development Goal, ongoing maintenance, and how visibility of our efforts has helped expose areas that need work. We will also share how we use the map in our communications strategy to strengthen Geneseo as a leader in sustainability.

Weatherizing Together: Finding Effective Community Partnerships,"Is your school planning on or already implementing a home weatherization program? Have you found community partners for your program? Furman University's home weatherization program, the Community Conservation Corps (CCC), aims not only to help individual homeowners, but also to build an important relationship between the university and the community. The program began 9 years ago as a way to reduce homeowners' energy costs while claiming carbon credits from the energy saved. However, strong community partnerships have enabled the CCC to be much more effective. The Community Conservation Corps has uncovered multiple community partnerships from energy companies and contractors to non-profits and other universities that have made the program successful. This presentation will examine the various community partnerships the CCC has had, the benefits and barriers of forming collaborations, as well as future projects for collaboration.

Let's get together for a focused discussion about goals, challenges, and successes in your behavior change programs. Please bring any materials to share as we learn from each other. For those new to social marketing, it is not social media. Social marketing integrates commercial marketing concepts with other approaches to influence positive behavior change for individuals and communities-- all for a greater social good. It's getting you to brush your teeth, rather than getting you to buy the toothbrush. For a more technical explanation, industry leaders defined social marketing through a consensus definition building process in the following way: 'Social Marketing seeks to develop and integrate marketing concepts with other approaches to influence behaviors that benefit individuals and communities for the greater social good. Social Marketing practice is guided by ethical principles. It seeks to integrate research, best practice, theory, audience and partnership insight, to inform the delivery of competition sensitive and segmented social change programs that are effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable'.",2188,6513,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"behavior change,marketing",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Andrew Lentini,2188,Sustainability Coordinator,Alec Cooley,6513,Senior Advisor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Session participants will describe specific initiatives aimed at catalyzing transformative sustainable change in the campus community and in their regions. All of the participants - from Agnes Scott College, Georgia Institute of Technology, Emory University, University of Georgia, Spelman College, and Southface in the Atlanta area; Coastal Carolina University in Georgetown County, South Carolina; and Portland Community College in Portland, Oregon - are founding members of University Regional Centres of Expertise (RCE) on Education for Sustainable Development acknowledged by UNC, which aim to advance SDG #4 - 'ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all' - through university-community partnerships. The session will include a lightning round of presentations on a range of university initiatives - Emory's Water Hub that helps alleviate sanitary sewer overflows in underserved communities (SDG 6); Georgia Tech's Living Building - the first in the Southeast (SDG 9); Spelman's work with the EcoDistrict covering nearby Atlanta neighborhoods (SDG 11); Agnes Scott's educational programs linking climate action to gender equality (SDGs 5,13).",494,1109,3931,2188,2505,3192,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),community partnerships",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Susan Kidd,494,"Executive Director, Center for Sustainability",Jennifer Hirsch,1109,"Director, Center for Serve-Learn-Sustain",Ciannat Howett,3931,Director of Sustainability,Kevin Kirsche,2188,Director of Sustainability,Kim Smith,2505,Sociology Instructor,Iesha Baldwin,3192,Sustainable Spelman Student Intern, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8294/1130_Smith_0674.pdf,,,
Connecting Communities to Data That Matter - Linkages Through SDGs,"In recent years, a rising number of innovative firms and entrepreneurs have intentionally coalesced around university centers to bring invention plus implementation together. These universities known as anchor institutions typically are concentrated in downtown communities that grapple with sustainability challenges such as poverty, pollution, food deserts, etc., many of which are subsumed in the SDGs. While metro-Atlanta has one of the highest concentrations of institutions of higher education (IHE) in the United States, these anchor institutions have historically operated in silos and not been part of a network to address these challenges. United Nation sanctioned Regional Centres of Expertise (RCE) on Education for Sustainable Development bring this much needed collaborative support to these ecosystems. RCE Greater Atlanta, one of only 6 RCEs in the United States, is an innovative network of universities, government, and non-profits that emerged from a realization by many of these universities that a sharing of expertise beyond our campus walls and regional collaborations are needed for sustainable development. IHEs can serve a key role in bridging the gap between communities and lack of access to 'empowering data' that meet critical needs while at the same time empowering residents to become change agents in their communities, such as recent use of GIS mapping data to identify food desert challenges and opportunities. Our challenge then is connecting universities to the public, particularly vulnerable communities, to data that will inform their decision making processes and empower them to become change agents working towards implementing the SDGs in their communities. In addition to exploring this challenge, community partner, Kwabena Nkromo, Founder and Lead Principal of Atlanta Food & Farm PBC will discuss IHE's pivotal role in connecting vulnerable communities to data.",1109,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),data,research centers",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Carol Thurman,1109,Academic Assessment Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9051/1430_Thurman_0362.pdf,,,
Role of Higher Education Institutions in Reducing Poverty by Promoting Sustainable Tourism,"All college and university campuses are imbedded in a local community. All communities have the potential to offer ecotourism opportunities to residents and visitors. Ecotourism/sustainable toursim is now defined as 'responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of the local people, and involves interpretation and education' (TIES, 2015). The questions then become: How can the students, faculty and employees of higher education promote and support ecotourism/ sustainable tourism in their communities to leverage economic development? What methodologies and experiences exist on this topic? This session will share what has been done in the community colleges of Santa Fe, NM and Dallas, TX. The presentation will describe of the work with stakeholders to promote and train the community about the importance of sustainable development and how ecotourism can help conserve the environment and produce jobs and quality of life for the local community.

Using the UN SDGs to frame community resilience assessment and planning for students and partners,"After Allegheny signed Second Nature's Resilience Commitment (Climate Commitment signed in 2007), the sustainability coordinator cultivated collaborative partnerships in the community and explored ways to support existing work while developing a unique resilience assessment and planning process that cultivates a community-based understanding of our vision for the future. An existing process, My Meadville, funded by the Orton Foundation, allowed Allegheny to partner with individuals working out of the Meadville Redevelopment Authority to interview over 700 citizens, gather stories, and transform them (through transcription and coding) to establish eight community themes and value statements that resonate with citizens. In parallel to this work, the sustainability coordinator and a professor of Environmental Science and Sustainability integrated the community resilience assessment work into the curriculum of a junior seminar. A team of nine students approached resilience through the lens of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to understand local resilience within the global context while challenging first-world assumptions about where and who issues of poverty, hunger, inequality, etc. are experienced.

"Educating, Engaging and Empowering Sustainable Businesses Through a Smart Business Challenge","A vital facet in ensuring a sustainable community is sustainable awareness and commitment of its businesses. As part of the Town Gown Collaboration with the Iowa State University Office of Sustainability and the City of Ames Electric Services Department and Chamber of Commerce, a unique approach has been implemented toward engaging and empowering community businesses in sustainability. The City of Ames Smart Business Challenge both celebrates dedication to and accomplishment in environmental, economic and social sustainability as well as offers connection to expertise and resources toward increased and collaborative commitment. This session will describe the process of creating a model specifically for the community of Ames, Iowa, that is also easily transferable to any size community. Time will be spent on lessons learned and adjustments made to ensure the most effective and relevant program was offered to community businesses that also supported an overarching sustainable vision for the collective Ames community.",3118,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"small businesses,community partnerships",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Merry Rankin,3118,Director of Sustainability,Taylor Silvestrini,3118,Smart Business Challenge Coordinator,Scott Nemec,3118,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8510/0830_Nemec_0908.pdf,,,
Repairing our Foodshed,"Wells College has acted to address gaps within its local foodshed. Responding to area 'food desert' conditions, the college initiated the Aurora Farmers Market to provide community residents access to fresh, locally-grown, seasonal produce during summer months and offering small area gardeners and growers with a retail opportunity for their bounty. The 4-year-old Aurora Farmers Market is run by a paid student market manager, supported by Wells student interns. The College is also in its fourth year of offering a free community Seed Exchange program, operated out of the institution's Library - hundreds of area gardeners and small produce growers have utilized the exchange to obtain free seed, much of it organic and GMO-free. The College's Introduction to Gardening class offers students in the college's Sustainable Food Systems program with hands-on learning opportunities. This team-taught course - so far including faculty from Biology, Chemistry, Anthropology, English, Japanese, Sociology, Women's and Gender Studies, and other disciplines - has developed on-campus gardens that supply enhanced learning and tasty produce to the campus community.",4581,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Grounds,Food & Dining,,,,,"farmer's markets,seeds,gardens",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Marian Brown,4581,"Director, Center for Sustainability and the Environment", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9200/1430_Brown_0529.pdf,,,
What Does a Tree Have to Do with Interior Design?,"On the McConnell Springs site of Lexington, Kentucky, there exists an historically significant tree - one of only a few old Bur Oaks that remain since the early days of settlement. Its large, impressive form encourages visitors as they walk by and encourages visitors to explore. However, a massive branch is growing out and over the pedestrian trail. Over time, the tree will be unable to support the growing branches because the core of the tree is hollow, making a more typical cable system would not provide an effective solution. One design faculty assigned first year students the task of designing a tree crutch for the Bur Oak, taking into consideration how surrounding elements interact with the tree crutch and the overall space as well how users interacted with it. By allowing students to become intimately familiar with the design process, many practical, yet design conscious structures were created that would not only complement the Bur Oak but also act as support for the overhanging limb. If the limb were to fall, it would be upheld by the tree crutch, thus keeping visitors and the surrounding trees safe. As the project continued to develop, the faculty member and a select group of students connected with community members, stakeholders and specialists, through a collaborative process - a Community Design Event. The process began by creating informational material to hang in the Community Room at McConnell Springs to gather ideas, which was followed by an open-invitation charrette. The results from the charrette, including the designs created by the students will be implemented into building the tree crutch, with construction scheduled to begin Spring 2018. A project focusing on bringing the study of interiors to the outdoors transcends the traditional ideas and boundaries, prioritizes sustainability, and challenges students to think of the outdoors as a space that can be preserved and renewed through theories of human interaction and experience of space.",1600,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Curriculum,,Design,,,,trees,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Emily Andreasson,1600,Student,Alexa King,1600,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Blending Sustainability & Community Engagement in STEM: Models from 4 Diverse Universities,"From diverse institutional perspectives, this interactive session explores community engagement through course-based sustainability projects done in collaboration with community partners. We will outline important opportunities and challenges of this work in STEM settings; describe salient connections in our programs to the UN Sustainable Development Goals; discuss how to navigate obstacles common to community-based or experiential learning programs; and share key examples and best practices that can inform the work of practitioners at the intersections of STEM, community engagement, and sustainability. Addressing Virginia Tech's Civic Agriculture and Food Systems Minor, a faculty member in Sustainable Food Systems and a Community Partner Liaison will discuss high impact project-based learning opportunities such as Community Action Projects (CAPstones) and strategic actions that support the Minor, such as the forming of an Advisory Task Force including partners, faculty, and students. Offering a perspective from Villanova, leadership from the Engineering Service Program will unfold that program's particular combination of deep community relationships, multiple forms of expertise, and project implementation processes that fuel international engineering service-learning opportunities with local partners in Cambodia, Costa Rica, Ghana and other partner communities abroad.",1109,400,1334,1718,,,,Public Engagement,Curriculum,,,,,,"STEM,service learning",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Ruthie Yow,1109,Service Learning and Partnerships Specialist,Jennifer Hirsch,1109,"Director, Center for Serve-Learn-Sustain",Susan Clark,400,Associate Professor,Jonelle Bradshaw de Hernandez,1334,"Senior Director, Corporate and Foundation Relations",Jordan Ermilio,1718,"Director, Engineering Service Learning Program", ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
A University-Community Research Collaboration to Promote Sustainable Agriculture for Food Security,"Many counties of Western North Carolina have high levels of food insecurity that may be addressed by training communities to grow, prepare, and preserve their own food. Through the McCullough Fellows program, the University of North Carolina Asheville develops partnerships between faculty and students with area organizations to address locally identified needs. In collaboration with a Section 8 housing development in Polk County, NC and the local organization Groundswell International, a faculty-student team from UNCA developed and tested a sustainable agriculture curriculum in the summer of 2016. Research for the program development investigated successful community agriculture projects and assessed participant learning. Weekly classes were conducted and evaluated, and an overall assessment of the program included pre- and post-surveys. Challenges included frustration over constraints enforced by the housing rules, poor soil, and unbearable Polk County heat. This program specifically addresses the second Sustainable Development Goal: to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. The final 'Grow Food Where People Live' 13-lesson curriculum is open access and, with some modifications based on region, can be applied to any community struggling with food security challenges.",4237,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Food & Dining,Curriculum,,,,,"food security,sustainable agriculture",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Alison Ormsby,4237,"Faculty, Environmental Studies", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
"SDG2: Global Challenge, Local Solutions Powered by Penn State University Food Security Initiatives","With the mission of creating hunger-free and healthy communities through engaged scholarship, several Penn State campuses have joined forces to begin the efforts in their regions. They have partnered with non-profit organizations to offer meaningful service learning opportunities but also to enhance the operations of the partners in the area of Zero Hunger. The student-driven projects include creating food pantries on the campuses, gleaning food for regional food pantries, Waste Not programs, community tables with homeless populations, community-based activities and United Nations exercises. A much bigger project that several campuses have started and are growing is student farms. In these farms, best practices are shared with our communities. The gardens are tasked with running sustainably through Community Supported Agriculture, selling back to campus or other venues. A portion of the community gardens goes directly to support the underserved in our communities. The goal of these projects is twofold; to increase meaningful engaged scholarship opportunities for our students while increasing community engagement which will build capacity and increase town/gown relations. The connecting element of all of these projects is the educational opportunities for our college-level students to create a change in culture for future generations.

"Intersections of Food Waste, Hunger, and Spectrums of Homelessness, Abuse, and Addiction","Homeless adults have disproportionate rates of chronic diet-related diseases, food security, rates of obesity, as well as co-morbidities such as diabetes. The outlook is even worse for children and youth. Yet, most have access to a preponderance of energy-dense, nutrient-deficient foods at shelters and pantries. University of Utah's Center for Community Nutrition has implemented a longitudinal study assessing the efficacy of nutrition education, healthy food access, and food environment improvements for individuals, families, and youth across spectrums of homelessness, abuse, and addiction. One commonality is that our clients face chronic stress. Continual activation of stress hormones alters physiological processes, and is shown to be a correlate to obesity, heart disease, addiction, depression, and more. To compound these effects, a key stress hormone, cortisol, is increased during caloric restriction, which then cyclically increases stress levels. We are working with shelters to improve existing, or start new, on-site vegetable gardens. Through our campus Food Recovery Network, we work with our Dining Services, restaurants, and grocers to decrease healthy foods from entering landfills through diverting food waste to our shelter sites. And, we photographically document shelter pantries and food storage to measure shelters' food environment changes. Our aim is to increase access to healthy foods, decrease hunger, decrease food waste, and improve the food environment.",3994,6643,,,,,,Public Engagement,Food & Dining,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,"food waste,hunger,wellness,food recovery,food banks & pantries",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Shannon Jones,3994,Associate Instructor/Project Lead,Jennifer Nielsen,6643,Chartwells, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Solar and Sheep Grazing - Is it for Ewe?,"Does your institution have solar panels or are you thinking about installing them? Does your institution have sheep or know someone who does? If you answered 'yes' to either of these questions, then you (ewe) may be ready for a Solar-Sheep partnership. Solar panels, while certainly great at producing renewable energy, come at a cost. Installation costs aside, there are additional, longer-term costs like ground and fence maintenance and the more abstract opportunity cost of land that is now 'tied up' for a single purpose. What if we could find a way to reduce some of those costs? Enter: sheep. Why sheep? Sheep, unlike goats, are grazers, eating short plants close to the ground. They can easily graze the hard-to-reach areas underneath the panels, fertilizing as they go, reducing the need for time-consuming, costly, greenhouse gas-producing mowing. The solar panels provide shade and shelter for the sheep, and if adequate fencing is in place and water is available, often no other infrastructure is necessary. This sustainable partnership can make financial sense, practical sense, and be a great way to forge a unique community partnership while providing ample opportunities for learning and engagement. In this session, we will discuss the solar-sheep partnership at Furman University, including how it originated, key stakeholders, the hurdles we encountered along the way, the current status, and our plans for the future.",3836,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Grounds,Energy,,,,,"solar,solar panels,livestock",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Laura Bain,3836,Associate Director of Sustainability Assessment,Hannah Dailey,3836,Program Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9170/1430_Bain_0501.pdf,,,
EAN Sustainability Index: How to Measure the Sustainability in an University Incubator?,"The implementation of sustainability at the EAN University is a process that takes more than eight years, however, being an institution whose focus is entrepreneurship, it is clearly necessary to incorporate sustainability into the process of training future entrepreneurs, but also, It requires tools to measure 'how sustainable is an enterprise'. More than 300 ideas pass annually through the EAN Impacta program (EAN university incubator program) and more than 30 new companies leave the University every year with their business models. Therefore, it was necessary to develop a tool to help measure the level of implementation of the sustainability of these new ventures, beyond the theoretical-practical content offered at different elective and nuclear courses at the academic levels. With this in mind, criteria and variables of previous research were proposed and analyzed to determine qualitative and quantitative variables that would allow the development of a quantitative index. This index allows to measure objectively and under a series of standard criteria the degree of appropriation and implementation of sustainability in the new companies, in accordance with the EAN Impacta program and the SDGs (sustainable development goals), but fully applicable and replicable in external initiatives. The validation and application of this Index was developed from the hand of the District Department of Economic Development of the city of Bogotá between 2017-2018.",5109,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Coordination & Planning,Research,"Business, Management, & Finance",,,,"entrepreneurship,business",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Jose Martinez Sepulveda,5109,Sustainability Department Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8308/0830_MartinezSepulveda_0684.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8308/1400_MartinezSepulveda_0684.pdf,,
Measuring Student Attitudes Towards Sustainable Development With a One-Semester Sustainovation,"In Fall 2017, Penn State Brandywine kicked off an initiative titled Sustainovation, emphasizing programming and community collaborations through sustainability and innovation. The campus identified three community partners to work with to assist in advancing the partner education and outreach goals. Several courses and student clubs from across the campus came together at the beginning of the semester for an initial meeting to be introduced to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to meet the community partners and to hear about the semester projects. In addition, a survey was given to the students to define their attitudes towards sustainable development before working with these partners and the projects. The validated survey from Biasutti & Frate (2017) addressed the four constructs of environment, economy, society, and education. Throughout the semester, students from across the disciplines and faculty/staff from Academic Affairs, IT, and the Library worked with adding an educational component to a local arboretum's fall festival, bringing mobile technology to an updated tree biodiversity tour at a state park, and writing essays addressing the SDGs as a curricular resource for a statewide teacher organization. At the end of the semester, the same survey was given to student participants in sustainovation projects. Aggregate data show that there is a statistically significant difference in student attitudes at the 95% confidence level (t-test).",4147,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Research,Waste,,,,,"student attitudes,community partnerships",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Laura Guertin,4147,Professor of Earth Science,Karen Theveny,4147,"Lecturer, Communications", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Lifting up the UN SDG's in Pennsylvania: The Power of the Penn State Sustainable Communities Network,"The Sustainable Communities Collaborative Network at Penn State is an example of the power of working across campus boundaries to address sustainable development projects state-wide. Six campuses have worked collaboratively with each other and with community partners on a variety of projects that address many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals including SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). Monthly meetings allow the campuses to identify barriers and obstacles, brainstorm collectively, and share solutions. The network of faculty and staff among the campuses shares tools such as a Memorandum of Understanding, a Project Agreement Form, a learning assessment instrument, and funding opportunities to strengthen our work as a University and to improve the quality of the work that we do with our community partners. The network approach also allows sharing of faculty expertise across campuses so that faculty and students from one campus can work with a partner in the community of a different campus. The presenters will share lessons learned and tips for success in establishing a network and using the UN SDG's as a framework for working in communities.",4190,4147,,,,,,Public Engagement,,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),community partnerships,inter-campus collaboration",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Ilona Ballreich,4190,Program Manager,Peter Boger,4190,"Assistant Director for Outreach and Engagement, Sustainability Office",Angela Fishman,4190,Associate Teaching Professor,Laura Guertin,4147,Professor of Earth Science,Karen Theveny,4147,"Lecturer, Communications", ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10150/1430_Ballreich_0541.pdf,,,
"10,000 Makes Mini Sustainable Product Make-A-Thon","This workshop is the Design U 10 Thousand Makes Make-A-Thon but in a smaller workshop format. The 10,000 Makes Make-A-Thon is give them a pile of reused materials and a glue gun, or something similar and tell them to ideate different ways that they can take something and reuse it for something else or create something new. Design U every year puts on the 10,000 makes 24 hour make-a-thon where we bring in engineers, designers and business students to create something new. We start by giving them a how might we statement which goes along with our yearly theme. This year we chose Sustainability and Upcycling. Up until this year sustainability has not been our main focus, we haven't even thought about it. As a team we sat down and had to think about our team, we mainly wanted to think about impact and making sure that this Make-A-Thon would change how people perceive design, engineering and business. We decided to eliminate the plethora of resources and the budget to buy materials that the participants had in years past and use Thinking Sustainably is basically the same thing as design thinking because you need to brainstorm other uses to even how to get your materials to a place where they can be reused. Students and facility will get in groups of 5-9 and begin by brainstorming what they could do with the objects on their table. The objects on the table are basically found objects that will be provided from a reuse center. Next, ideas will be written down on white boards and write down as many ideas as they can for different ways to combine, subtract, add and make something new from what they have. The idea is to get quantity over quality which means the more ideas that you generate the better the ideas will get. The teams sketch every idea and briefly explain the idea to the group The idea is to use what you have to make something new that serves a purpose. The group votes on an idea and then with a few adhesives will build their final product.",32,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Waste,,,,,,"reuse,do-it-yourself,upcycling",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jessica Foor,32,Graphic Designer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Localizing UN Sustainable Development Goals in Hawaii: The Community as our Living Laboratory,"The 2018 State of Hawaii legislative session saw the introduction of bills to codify the UN SDG framework at the local level. Hawaii has a long history of sustainability, and its integrated approach to environmental, social, and economic priorities corresponds closely to the SDGs. A set of statewide 2030 sustainability goals, developed through Hawaii's Aloha+ Challenge, is a recognized place-based model to implement the SDGs and can serve as an example for other state and local governments of a cutting-edge initiative to localize the global goals. Just as the global SDGs can provide a balanced blueprint for local policy, bottom-up initiatives, such as the Aloha + Challenge, can demonstrate local community solutions to global challenges. This presentation: 1) tracks the journey of the SDG-related bills through Hawaii's 2018 legislative session; 2) considers how other subnational governments can learn from the Hawaii case to localize SDGs; and 3) examines the role of higher education, community engagement, and partnerships in promoting SDGs.

Taking It to the Next Level: Campus-Community Partnerships,"Engagement between campus and the local community is a strong priority for many institutions, often focused in service learning and volunteerism. But siloed approaches to service learning and volunteerism do not always address the complete needs of the community. Comprehensive course-community programs take engagement to a higher level, addressing real world challenges with the expertise of faculty, the ingenuity of students, and the perspectives from community partners. This model brings courses from across the university to focus on real-world challenges that are identified by a community partner, simultaneously providing experience to students and solutions to sustainability issues. These programs have the ability to address the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on a local and state level. In this panel representatives from multiple universities that have incorporated similar frameworks will reflect on their experience in addressing SDGs through collaborative partnerships. Penn State will share an example of a single project that brought five courses from five different colleges together to collaborate on a single project that touches on multiple SDG's including Good Health & Wellbeing (SDG 3), Clean Water & Sanitation (SDG 6) and Life on Land (SDG 15).

Raising the Bar - Updated Environmental & Social Criteria for EPEAT-Registered Computers/Displays,"Product design has progressed, and EPEAT standards are progressing along with them. An update to the computer and display standard that large-scale purchasers have relied on to identify more sustainable IT products over the past 11 years is near completion. New criteria include include supplier energy efficiency; full material disclosure; labor and human rights; occupational health and safety, F-GHG emissions; reporting on suppliers; CSR practices, raw materials extraction; and conflict mineral reporting. Products that meet the new standard, with elevated sustainability and social criteria, will begin to appear on the EPEAT Registry in November of this year. This session will guide those who currently require use of EPEAT for purchase of computer and display products on how to best address the transition to the new standard, including revisiting current EPEAT specified language in contracts, and a review of the status of EPEAT products currently being purchased. Those who are not yet evaluating their IT products for sustainability will leave the session with easy-to-use tools for aligning electronic procurement with their overall sustainability goals.

Data-Driven Planning for Campus Materials Management - From Inputs Through Outputs,"While the higher education sustainability field is grappling with materials management challenges, from procurement through waste operations, there are limited tools and processes for data-driven planning. University campuses yield the purchasing power and environmental impact of small cities. We import nearly all materials needed to sustain residential populations and fuel research activities, driving demand for thousands of products from global supply chains. Our campuses also export nearly all waste generated, relying on processing systems driven by available infrastructure and global markets. Fulfillment of our educational and research missions and achievement of positive contributions requires material consumption; however, there are also impacts of material consumption that lack alignment with higher education's values, posing reputational risks to our institutions. In order to grow a more sustainable approach at MIT, we've formed a faculty/researcher/student/operations partnership to understand material flows--grounded in urban metabolism-- impacts and opportunities. By establishing a baseline campus materials flow analysis, MIT aims to use data-driven planning to leverage MIT's purchasing power-of both procurement activities and waste management-in order to drive impacts that reflect MIT values while mitigating risks.",2697,,,,,,,Purchasing,Coordination & Planning,Waste,,,Purchasing/Procurement,,materials management,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Brian Goldberg,2697,Sustainability Staff,Rachel Perlman,2697,Graduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8273/0915_Goldberg_0659.pptx,,,

Internal Carbon Tax: Methods and Results from the First Rigorous Willingness-to-Pay Study,"Internal carbon fees raise awareness, incentivize behavior changes, and create revenue streams to reduce emissions. While there are a substantial number of internal carbon pricing programs in the private sector, these programs are still very rare in universities. There appears to be no published academic research, as yet, that explores the systematic determinants of individuals' willingness to incur the costs of internal carbon pricing programs of different types. Using realistic policy choice scenarios and best practices from so-called 'stated preference' research the University of Oregon research team assessed the strength of demand for several types of internal carbon pricing programs. We established price points constituents are willing-to-pay in exchange for emissions reductions. Since the costs and benefits are unlikely to be uniformly distributed (there will be 'winners' and 'losers') the project also investigates how they are valued by different campus stakeholders. This research is guided by Dr. Trudy Cameron, a noted environmental economist and expert in the design of stated preference surveys.",3746,,,,,,,Research,Air & Climate,Investment & Finance,,,,,carbon pricing,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Steve Mital,3746,Director of Sustainability,Ryan Walch,3746,Ph.D. Candidate, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

Campus Action Research Advances Sustainable Development Goals,"Across North American college campuses, learners seek to enhance our sustainability competency through acting locally to advance the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainability Action Research (SAR) provides a systematic approach for both students and practitioners to do so. Here we define SAR as an iterative process of assessment, planning, action and reflection to test and advance a theory of change toward realizing sustainable development. We demonstrate how faculty, students and staff can serve as SAR catalysts and leaders. For example, George Mason University faculty use SDGs as an organizing framework for undergraduate sustainability majors' capstone SAR projects and as foci for developing an interdisciplinary graduate certificate in Action Research for Social and Ecological Impact.

Ecological Grief: How Higher Education Responds to Environmental Trauma,"Grieving the loss or change of a cherished natural space has not always been recognized as a true form of grieving. With summers filled with smoke, devastating flooding, record-breaking hurricanes and subtle changes in the seasons, ecological grief is now starting to become recognized as a legitimate form of mourning and anxiety. This presentation provides a brief introduction to the concept of ecological grief, by highlighting the similarities and differences from other forms of grief. This discussion draws from 2016 field work conducted in the Ghost River Valley in Alberta, Canada, during a clearcut logging event. Following an introduction to the topic of ecological grief, this presentation will explore how post-secondary institutions can support the growing number of students and employees who may be experiencing environmental trauma and grief. How do we mentally and emotionally grapple with environmental change, not just mitigate and adapt? How can we support climate refugees? What role does higher education play in the psychological responses to climate change?",6424,,,,,,,Research,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,"disaster & emergency response,grief,refugees",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Amy Spark,6424,Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10532/0830_Spark.pdf,,,
Becoming a Social Organism: Action Research Turns Environmental Research Into a Sustainable Act,"""What is the impact of my work on the environment?"", asks designer and educator Victor Papanek in the first chapter of his revolutionary 1995 book, The Green Imperative. Papanek's words drive my teaching every day and lead me to question the meaning and purpose of contemporary sustainability research in education. I will present my research, a case study that takes place at Shenkar College of Engineering, Design and Art in Tel-Aviv, where I teach. The research is inspired by David Orr's approach that ""all education is environmental education"" and by Fritjof Capra's holistic view that life is a complex system that integrates organisms, social systems and ecosystems. I will show how an ordinary qualitative research study evolved into Action Research involving a group of twelve faculty members, who, by sharing their sustainable ideas, projects and curricula raised awareness of ecological and social issues through the power of art and design. The goal of the group was to prepare collective work for an exhibition on environmental issues, however through the creative process - meetings, acting, connecting and sharing - we gave birth to a new social organism that had a transformative effect on the members as teachers and individuals. Through audience participation I will demonstrate the concept of the interconnected system methodology and provide session participants with creative social tools to inspire their own research and teaching on their campuses and in their communities.",8636,,,,,,,Research,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,action research,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Rakefet Kenaan,8636,Senior Lecturer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7919/1130_Kenaan_0340.pdf,,,
Microbial assessment of rainwater tanks and runoff retention basins: A pilot study,"Exploring the reuse potential of stormwater runoff and the roof-top rainwater, to meet water supply needs on the University campus is the core focus of this research. Although rainwater is generally considered clean, the potential of public health risk associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms cannot be ignored. Faeces of wild birds, insects, mammals and reptiles that have access to the roof can be washed into the holding tank during rain events. Main objective of the work is to characterize microbial quality of the collected rain/storm water on the campus to understand the presence-absence of 6 target pathogens - Shigella flexneri, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Legionella spp., L. pneumophila and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in correspondence with the fecal indicator organism - enterococci. A secondary objective is to test for drug resistance genes in the samples as that will allow us to profile for priority contaminants in the study samples. The study focuses on testing the water stored in 6 retention basins and 2 rainwater barrels on West Chester University (WCU) campus. The results of this study will provide baseline data to understand microbial threats to campus stored rainwater/runoff water. The study is currently ongoing and samples will be analyzed for target pathogens during Summer 2018. Preliminary results of a PCR testing conducted on water samples recovered from six WCU water retention areas indicated presence of pathogenic Shigella flexneri in tested samples.",3773,,,,,,,Research,Grounds,Water,,,,,"rainwater,stormwater",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Qunaisha Burrows,3773,Water quality assessment of rain water tanks and reservoirs on campus: A pilot study, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Achieving Intertwined Sustainable Development Goals Through Coastal Resilience Research,"Sustainable policy, design, and visualization strategies are essential as climate change and sea level rise threaten coastal cities. Higher education institutions in coastal regions have the opportunity to conduct meaningful scholarly research and make a real difference in their communities by engaging these challenges. Norfolk, Virginia is experiencing some of the highest rates of sea level rise globally. Wetlands loss, hardened shorelines, and river dredging reduce coastal resilience and threaten human livelihoods and cultures. Through a stakeholder engagement process with the City of Norfolk and several NGO and community organizations, a trans-disciplinary University of Virginia research team of faculty and students developed adaptive design proposals for several vulnerable Norfolk neighborhoods. Using ecosystem services as a framework, they made informed decisions about environmental, socio-cultural, and aesthetic benefits. Integrated quantitative and qualitative methodologies valued assets not easily measured. Scenarios creatively combined natural and synthetic strategies for landscapes and buildings (eg. living shorelines, wetland inundation parks, floating and elevated buildings). Adaptive measures were designed as restorative and recreational public places that connect Norfolk residents with their river. Several Sustainable Development Goals are addressed, including climate action, sustainable cities, clean water and sanitation, and good health and well-being.",4028,,,,,,,Research,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),coastal focus,resilience",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Phoebe Crisman,4028,"Professor/Director, Global Environments + Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8496/1400_Crisman_0887.pdf,,,
Transdisciplinary Undergraduate Research In Costa Rica: 5 Week Faculty Led Study Abroad Model,"This session explains the process and lessons learned as Central College (Pella, Iowa) faculty and staff developed undergraduate research opportunities within the model of a short-term faculty-led study abroad program in Costa Rica. This academically rigorous summer program focuses on a multitude of research areas related to the UN SDGs, including topics in health, wellness, and global sustainability; emphasizing the interconnectedness of environmental, ecological, social, political, and economic systems. Developed by faculty from English, Biology, and Exercise Science, the program was conceived with sustainability as a core theme connecting disciplines and increasing access to undergraduate research opportunities in departments that have traditionally had fewer, like those currently seen in the humanities. Vital to this last point, presenters will explain how they negotiated issues of research supervision and disciplinary authority in such a way that the program is open to students from multiple disciplines without forcing the program budget to absorb costs for multiple faculty supervisors traveling and living in-country. Additionally, the session will introduce best practices and ethical considerations for sustainability, study abroad, and community-based research. Presenters will describe a series of site visits and ongoing communications with communities and partner institutions in Costa Rica, which has been essential to establishing mutually beneficial relationships. Together, a coalition of students, faculty advisors, sustainability & study abroad staff, and local research hosts support the development of research questions that are of value not just to the students, but to the community in which the research will take place. This program also incorporates principles of fair-trade learning by encouraging students to proactively share their research findings with the local communities with whom they collaborate.",4371,,,,,,,Research,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,"study abroad,faculty",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Cierra Rustad,4371,Undergraduate Student,Sara Shuger Fox,4371,Assistant Professor of Exercise Science, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
WEB of Science Database: Sustainable Knowledge of the Hopi A Prototype for the Future Research,"The Hopi tribe of the US Southwest is the carrier of the traditional knowledge (TK) comprising the knowledge of sustainable living. The search of the Web of Science database has been performed to analyze the representation of the Hopi people in publications for the period from 1900 to 2016. The aim of the analysis was to reveal connections between the science and the Hopi sustainable practices. Data mining for the topic 'hopi' resulted in 670 available sources from the Core Collection with the 219 abstracts constituting the prototype of the corpus. The language patterns in the corpus were analyzed using Tableau, AncConc, and Sketchengine. The rise in number of publications starting 1990s indicates awakening of the interest to the Hopi theme with the main increase of publications in Geosciences. Based on the language patterns the observed trends in changes include a shift from the earlier image of the Hopi as an exotic object to the Hopi image as a subject, an informant, and a patient. The sampling concludes that the Hopi TK, the Hopi way of living and their remarkable sustainability practices do not have sufficient representation in the scientific publications. Finding the root cause of changes in the representation of the Hopi people in the Web of Science publications requires building of the full-length corpus.",4531,,,,,,,Research,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,,indigenous focus,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Arina Melkozernova,4531,Instructional Designer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Automated Gardening System with Solar Integration,"Industrialized agriculture has benefitted our society by feed billions but is also adding a burden to the environment. Inefficient watering techniques and indiscriminate use of chemicals in much of today's industrialized agriculture practices are not sustainable. Organic farming is an environmental friendly alternative, but with a catch-it is labor intensive and in many parts of the world, less cost competitive with industrialized agriculture. The Automated Gardening System with Solar Integration project, self-initiated by us undergraduate students from Carnegie Mellon University, aim to explore the use of robotics in agriculture. We, as a group of six, began our planning process during the fall of 2017. Researching different options to make a 2D planting system, we settled with a belt-conveyor design that is cost-effective for gardening. After building a computer model with the design, we began the building process by prototyping the 3D printed parts. We participated the Build18 electrical engineering hackathon at Carnegie Mellon during the first week of the Spring 2018 semester. During that week, we successfully built our 2 feet by 2 feet gantry system where a mount with a watering hose and camera is able to move in 2D space and dispense water at locations with plants. Currently, we are implementing a solar power integration so that this system will be functional in off-grid locations as well. Another exciting development is the use of computer vision to differentiate weeds from plants. This second prototype will also include a z-axis manipulator that could interact with the garden by poking selected weeds back into the soil and planting seeds from a seed reservoir. This project has gained attention during the showcase of the hackathon. This is a long term project and the group is excited about bring new developments to the system. By combining academic interests and passion in sustainability, students like us are coming up with creative solutions to global problems.",2849,,,,,,,Research,Food & Dining,,Agriculture,,,,"solar,technology,robotics",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Chun Ming Jeffrey Zhang,2849,Co-President, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9442/1430_Zhang_0785.pdf,,,

"From Bags to Boards: The Experimentation Behind the Recycled Building Material ""BagBoard""","In the United States alone, the EPA estimates that 380 BILLION plastic bags are used once and then discarded. The answer to this plastic plague may come from the small nonprofit, Full Belly Project, in Wilmington, North Carolina in the form of 'Bag Board.' Bag Board is one of their inventions created through a process of folding, heating, and compressing over 900 plastic bags into a solid board, comparable to an elementary school desktop or a thick piece of plywood. Bag Board is still in its experimental phase and the process of making it isn't perfect. I have been working to find the most efficient way to create the highest quality boards. I've taken risks and been rewarded but have also experienced setbacks and failures at every step in the creation process. Throughout the presentation I will explain the best methods, the worst failures, and the learning process that I have been though while creating Bag Board. Another topic that I will discuss is my findings on the safety of the Bag Board creation process as the idea of a board made of baked plastic bags, understandable, raises a flag to many who know plastic's toxic potential. The next step in Bag Board's story will be testing to see what environmental factors the board can withstand. These findings will be used to better understand the board's potential in the world of construction, creation, and environmental advancement. Bag Board's future is bright, but it needs more research behind it to get it off the ground. The audience members who attend will have gotten a chance to get up-close and personal with Bag Board, learned about the behind-the-scenes of its creation and get a glimpse into the exciting future of testing and product design that the board will be undergoing.",740,,,,,,,Research,Waste,,,,,,"recycling,upcycling,plastics,plastic bags,plastic reduction",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Megan Romanchok,740,Undergraduate Student,Kathryn Pohlman,740,Chief Sustainability Officer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9407/1430_Romanchok_0744.pptx,,,
"Living Housed, Healthily and Happily: Conceptualizing Disparaging Circumstances in Queer Communities","The data and implications aim to identify the meaning of social sustainability while highlighting issues within the field. LGBTQ communities are affected by many adverse circumstances and their lives can be harmed without basic day to day fundamentals like food and housing security. Historically, there have been no intentional records of lgbtq youth experience with respect to food and housing insecurity in the lowcountry of Charleston, SC ever before. With the collaboration of the College of Charleston Joseph P. Riley Center for Livable Communities and 'We Are Family', the only youth based lgbtq+ advocacy organization in the state of South Carolina. The Riley Center for Livable Communities and We Are Family developed a survey that would be administered to both College of Charleston students and local youth (under the age of 25) in order to asses their exact circumstances as they relate to both food and housing insecurity. The findings among College of Charleston students regarding inadequate housing and meals per week were alarming enough to gain the attention of the greater city officials and beg the question of what viable remedies could be implemented to eradicate these issues.Both We Are Family and The Riley Center have devised a 'street mapping' process to canvass areas throughout the county in search of housing insecure youth either in between homes in a transient state or visibly on the street. Currently there are no agencies that provide shelter directly for lgbtq+ youth in the area and compiling this research/ data will allow for the City of Charleston and partnering agencies to determine funds needed to be allocated towards linkage to healthcare and rapid rehousing for these housing and food insecure lgbtq youth. The collection of this data and the compiling of all implications will serve as a catalyst for the City of Charleston to develop policies and procedures concerning housing and food insecure lgbtq+ youth and better define the resources needed.",5047,,,,,,,Research,Wellbeing & Work,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,"food security,housing,LGBTQ",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Vanity Reid Deterville,5047,Student Advocate/ Intern, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
How University Transportation Practitioners are Transforming USGBC's Global Transportation Emphasis,"Transportation is the fastest growing source of global C02 emissions. Two years ago, the USGBC added Parksmart, a parking-structure and transportation certification program, into its suite of offerings. Universities have taken the lead on certifying new and existing parking structures - and in so doing have accelerated the engagement of architects, engineers, sustainability staff, and parking professionals in the transportation sustainability discussion. Universities and colleges have been recognized by Parksmart for higher and better land use through sustainable structures, demonstrated cost-savings arising from Parksmart practices, and increased campus access while reducing SOV trips. Additionally, a number of university parking and transportation professionals have inspired the USGBC to grow a broader systems-based approach to assessing, recognizing, and promoting sustainable parking and transportation programs. These leaders are collaborating with USGBC to identify the most effective system practices and metrics to reduce SOV use, promote active transportation, encourage more sustainable forms of mobility, and reduce CO2 and other transportation-caused emissions. This presentation will feature discussions by ASU, Cornell, MSCBA, Stanford, and the USGBC on the creative dynamic in play here.

From Cars to Bikes - A Campus Transformation,"The transformation of physical environments on college campuses typically comes in the form of a formal master planning effort with great vision and fanfare. BUT there are other, more granular, ways to re-shape our campuses. At Purdue University we have been using bike infrastructure and the complete streets approach as a similarly effective tool in the steady deconstruction of the car-centric campus. Our transition in the treatment of street work and repair away from the curb-to-curb mentality toward adopting the Complete Streets and Road Diet approaches have been very influential in our most recent and successful projects, the State Street Redevelopment Project and the Purdue Discovery Park District, providing key proofs of concept. The State Street Redevelopment Project is a $120M infrastructure collaboration between Purdue University and the City of West Lafayette to use the main connection from the Wabash River, through downtown, through the university, and out to the western gateway as an opportunity to stitch these communities together. The Purdue Discovery Park District is a $1.2B public-private partnership to develop the western gateway of Purdue's campus, building a community from scratch. REA's bicycle planning work at multiple large campuses throughout Indiana (IU, Ball State, and Purdue) and their work on the Indianapolis Cultural Trail will bring a perspective of connecting dots and common themes among different institutions.

Sustainable for Your Bottom Line: Electric Buses and Simple Infrastructure for Your Campus Fleet.,"Campuses are growing and evolving, and with that, our transportation needs are changing. Now more than ever, we need smart solutions that provide safer, more reliable and cleaner transit. As we all know: When most engines burn fuel, they release harmful chemicals into the air. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and volatile organic compounds can all have a negative impact on your health day, electric buses are proving to meet those needs. The electric bus adoption rate is 10X that of electric passenger vehicles. This is the net steps in cleaning the air quality for our campuses. Electric buses are moving more people without a tailpipe than ever before! Transit agencies, Campuses, Airports and many commuter companies are moving towards all electric buses everyday. Revolutionary battery-electric buses help fleet operators abandon fossil fuels, improve environmental quality and reduce operating costs. Battery Electric Buses have proven themselves with millions of miles service in communities across North America, operating at a lower overall cost than any 35 or 40 foot diesel, hybrid or CNG transit vehicle. A revolution is taking place. The TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) saving of mainanace costs and fuel costs are proving to make battery electric transit for campuses a way to save money too! Many funding and leasing options now make it much easier to move to electrifying your campus fleet. Learn how to engage your utility, plan for a simple infrastructure, energy storage and renewable energy, while saving money and reducing your GHG emissions. What is learned froths clean transportation program could then be unitized as a curriculum for transportation, renewable energy, and environmental education.

Environmental Impact and Cost Savings Data for Low Speed Electric Vehicles on College Campuses,"In this discussion we will review environmental and financial data from two separate universities that have reduced their carbon footprint and the cost of their campus fleet operations through the use of low speed, plug-in electric vehicles. The data collected comes from two different universities that have begun the process of converting their fleets over to low speed electric vehicles. We will share environmental data, collected from telematics devices, that shows how much CO2 emissions are being reduced. Additional metrics will demonstrate the cost of acquiring vehicles as part of a regular rotation of replacing aged vehicles and the reduced cost of vehicle maintenance and operations. We will also share low cost options for evaluating a campus fleet's performance. Many institutions of higher education across the country are leading the way to a more sustainable future by striving to meet demanding sustainability goals and mandates set by school administrations and state governments. As managers tackle the problems associated with campus fleets they come face-to-face with the extreme upfront purchase costs that come with plug-in electric cars, hybrids, and alternatively fueled vehicles. This approach will increase the cost of fleet management in an era where most public higher education institutions are still seeing budget shortfalls. That means increased transportation costs will reduce funding in other areas of campus operations.",8165,,,,,,,Transportation,Air & Climate,,,,Transportation & Parking,,"electric vehicles,fleet management",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Aaron Stegemann,8165,Director of Strategic Accounts, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10447/0830_Stegemann_1111.pptx,,,
A Sustainable Parking Framework and Strategies to Encourage More Sustainable Transportation,"Thompson Rivers University (TRU) is transitioning from a commuter campus to an urban campus with a vibrant heart. Guiding the process are strategic sustainable priorities consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11: 'Sustainable Cities and communities'. The Campus Master Plan, which provides guidelines for future development on campus, outlines key principles to densify the core of campus: replacing surface parking lots with a mix of academic, commercial and residential spaces to enhance the 24/7 usability of campus.. A key step in achieving this longer term vision was to transform from a campus where single-occupancy vehicles (SOV) dominated to a campus where alternate transportation becomes the norm. The Campus Strategic Sustainability Plan (CSSP) and the Sustainable Parking Framework (SPF), detailed below, have paved the way for change. Transportation, an important section of the CSSP, has 16 wide-ranging initiatives and strategies to reduce GHGs and improve air quality. These include implementing alternate transportation options such as ride sharing programs, car share services, and bike share programs, and improving bicycle facilities (showers storage). The CSSP also identifies ways to reduce SOVs from entering campus, such as telecommuting and improved pedestrian design. The SPF outlines a tiered system with economy lots on the campus perimeter, general parking zones, and reserved stalls in the campus core.",1431,,,,,,,Transportation,Air & Climate,,,,Transportation & Parking,,"parking,single occupancy vehicles",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Aaron Wiebe,1431,Research Assistant,James Gordon,1431,Environmental Programs & Research Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10116/1045_Wiebe_0398.pptx,,,
Designing Despite the Department of Transportation,"In a state, South Caroline, that is lacking in alternative transportation infrastructure and can barely maintain the infrastructure, how can a place of higher learning creative transportation? Most roads in Charleston, SC are owned by the state which means that changes and maintenance go through the Department of Transportation, DOT. Non-DOT streets are maintained by the City of Charleston. Both of them allow for the College of Charleston certain rights to the streets on and around the College of Charleston. So when the College of Charleston cannot physically change the infrastructure surrounding it, it must design a way to change the campus communities behavior when it comes to commuting to campus. Starting from freshman year and progressing to graduation, the College should use certain incentives to give students the ability to navigate without the use of a car. The College already has some facilities in place like a free bike share and free transit passes for students, and staff. Next step is surveying the community to discover what is needed to allow more people to use alternative transportation. Further the College can use negative reinforcement with accessibility and policy to make driving to campus less of an option. The final step is collaboration in innovation. As an institution we have many creative minds that should work together by facilitating inter-departmental working groups, task forces, or committees. Design students working with physics students to create interesting solar panel bus hubs where students can charge their phones or public health and exercise science students creating an app that traffics the benefit of walking to class. The College can use tactical urbanism to make alternative transportation the better option like painting crosswalks to bring beauty along with awareness to them.",5047,,,,,,,Transportation,Campus Engagement,,,,Transportation & Parking,,alternative transportation,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Eliza Bower,5047,Graduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Alternative Transportation in the Rural Context,"SUNY Cortland and other smaller comprehensive colleges function as economic drivers to the local economy, and especially in the case of smaller colleges located in more rural settings. In this context, what options do institutions have to leverage economic activity, encourage accessible alternative transportation, and reduce our carbon footprint while expanding our transportation options and increasing participation? SUNY Cortland was one of the first in the state system to offer a community bike program to encourage sharing and point to point use on campus. Like many campuses, we also offer Zipcar as a means to provide other options for those slightly longer trips where the campus bus loop does not go. As we investigate plans for future improvements to our internal operations and enhance economic partnerships, can we offer alternatives to enable increase use of electric vehicles, or potentially more common car-pool / van-pool options? How have other campuses facilitated the economic partnerships to benefit the broader community? Does size matter in this quest for enabling greater adoption of alternative modes of transit, as we move towards the post-carbon economy?

The Case Study of Universal Transit Pass (U-Pass) Programs at Eight US Universities,"Many universities across the US address sustainability on campus and aim at reducing the environmental footprint. Universities' strategies to reduce the carbon footprint include promoting alternative modes of travel, such as walking, biking, taking transit, carpooling, and van pooling, to reduce the amount and impacts of single occupancy vehicle (SOV) trips within transportation, along with other strategies, such as the use of renewable energy sources and cogeneration, recycling and composting, and campus gardening. In particular, a number of universities has adopted universal transit pass (U-pass), which is a transportation demand management program to provide free or substantially discounted transit service to students, faculty, and/or staff of the university, and reduce SOV commuting and parking demand on campus. In addition to environmental benefits, U-Pass programs also address the equity in accessibility. In this study, we examine U-pass programs at eight universities in the US regarding the types of U-pass program, costs and financing, effective discount rates, governance, and planning process. We conduct a study with particular attentions on: (1) the cost to the students and university, (2) contractual terms with the transit agency or agencies involving timing and funding, and (3) the governance and planning procedure that led to the successful implementation of the U-pass programs. Particularly, it is critical for a university to understand both the financial impacts of the members of campus community and the effectiveness of U-pass program in achieving its sustainability objectives, and communicate and negotiate with a transit agency regarding the payment and the level of transit service provided. Based on the study findings, we provide a set of factors to be evaluated and recommendations of the procedure and steps to be taken toward a successful implementation of U-pass program.",1712,,,,,,,Transportation,Public Engagement,,,,,,"u-pass,public transit",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Mark Stewart,1712,Sustainability Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
"Mitigating Air Travel Emissions: Measuring, Pricing and Collaboration","Presenters will discuss their approaches to tracking airline miles, estimating emissions, and counter-acting these emissions. Carbon neutral air travel requires data availability to accurately estimate emissions, but perhaps a larger barrier is identifying consistent funding to offset these emissions into the future. Presenting schools UCLA, Arizona State University and University of Maryland are the first schools in the US to implement a carbon surcharge on university air travel to fund emission reduction projects on-campus and annual offset purchases. Each school will present how they have navigated internal politics and public procurement processes to collect funding and retire offsets to address their annual emissions. Each school will discuss the structure chosen for their air travel fees and how the collected funds are utilized.

Dockless Bikeshare Successes: Minimizing Risks Through Proactive Planning and Communication,"Whether to reduce their carbon footprint, alleviate parking pains or address the first/last mile challenge for alternative commuters, institutions are increasingly looking to shared dockless mobility devices such as bicycles and scooters to encourage and enable alternative transportation. While there are some drawbacks to such models, many colleges and universities are eyeing dockless programs for their low cost, adaptability and data gathering potential. From feasibility study to launch day, learn about how California State University Northridge and the University of North Carolina Greensboro have used dockless bicycles and scooters to increase campus-community connectivity, improve safety and promote alternative transportation on their campuses.

Vermicompost: A Study of Alternative Composting in Arid Climates,"Traditional composting methods will often yield a nutrient-rich fertilizer. However, when such methods are performed in an arid climate, such as the Sonoran Desert, additional precautions must be taken to ensure quality. These steps can vary from methods of covering windrows of compost with tarps, to turning and spraying water into compost piles with heavy machinery. Yet, when water resources are precious, or the equipment to water the compost becomes unavailable, other methods of composting must be assessed. Vermicompost, the composting process utilizing worms to aid in the breakdown of organic materials, may provide an alternate solution to compost producers when water resources are scarce. This study will analyze a vermicompost operation being performed in the Tucson area by the University of Arizona's cooperative extension program, Compost Cats. The study will take an engineering approach to subjects including the system modeling, sensory analysis, and data analytics of the vermicomposting process - as well as an assessment of the quality of the compost produced. Additionally, the data from this study will help provide a basis for larger-scale operations of vermicomposting in desert climates.",4465,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"vermiculture,compost",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Ryan Yamauchi,4465,"Student, Compost Cats",Daniel Quinn,4465,Compost Cats - Equipment Specialist, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Sustaining the Borderlands: A Discussion on Food Waste in the Southwest,"Tucson, Arizona is situated 60 miles from the United States/Mexico International border. The nearest port of entry, Nogales, is one of the largest landlocked ports in North America. This port is responsible for funneling one quarter of the U.S. total fresh produce imports. This volume of import means a significant loss of organics -- 4,000 pounds out of every one million pounds of food that crosses the Nogales port of entry are sent to the landfill. A loss of produce represents organic material that must be sent to a landfill where the anoxic conditions accelerate the emission of methane gas, the most potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. This concerns the University of Arizona (UA) Compost Cats , who work to divert food waste from the landfill and provide commercial composting for more than 60 local businesses in the Tucson area. The UA Compost Cats have been successful in diverting over one million pounds of organics from the Los Reales landfill each year. Compost Cats partners with the City of Tucson to provide an alternate way to dispose of compostable bio waste for grocery stores, local businesses, community functions, as well as brush from city landscape maintenance. Expansion of this system of food waste diversion and philosophy of community sustainability is in the future for Compost Cats. The Fresh Produce Association of America recognizes the need to divert organics from the landfill and expresses interest in partnering with the UA Compost Cats to create a similar operation in Rio Rico, Arizona, less than 15 miles from the Nogales port of entry. This session will focus on the realities faced by commercial composting initiatives in the borderlands of the southwest.",4465,,,,,,,Waste,Public Engagement,,,,,,"food waste,compost",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Grace McGuire,4465,"Operations Manager, UA Compost Cats",Daniel Quinn,4465,Compost Cats - Equipment Specialist,Hunter Oldham,4465,Student,Chester Phillips,4465,Senior Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Zero Waste Campus: Mitigating Landfill Waste on an Urban College Campus,"Charleston, South Carolina is a coastal city that is home to the College of Charleston, an integrated city campus. As the city is on the forefront to experiencing rising sea level and intensifying storms, we intend to share how the College is taking a stand to mitigating its contribution to climate change for a sustainable future. Through the College's Office of Sustainability, our Zero Waste initiative is intended to help the College divert ≥90% of its waste from the landfill into either compost or recycling by 2030. The origin of Zero Waste at the College of Charleston draws heavily on the elements of Cradle to Cradle, a book by Michael Braungart and William McDonough that advises industries to follow biomimicry, where waste breaks down into biological and technical nutrients that will either be of environmental use or continue on a closed loop industrial cycle. The Office of Sustainability has since adopted this model and redesigned its philosophy by adding a Zero Waste Corps program that comprises of four student interns who lead individual projects, such as: infrastructural innovation, campus events, specialty recycling, and on-campus housing waste reduction. These interns work with other organizations and have various objectives such as special materials recycling, campus system redesign, and social outreach. Each intern works with the Office's goal for sustainable campus development by ensuring responsible consumption and education for all college affiliates. Asides from developing a more sustainable campus, this program teaches its interns to work collaboratively, analytically, and professionally to prepare them for their intended careers.",5047,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,,zero waste,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Neyle Steadman,5047,"Student, Office of Sustainability",Lauren Gabbamonte,5047,Undergraduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Utilizing Waste Management Plans in Residence Halls: A Case Study,"In large universities, waste and recycling can be a daunting task to take on and fix. At the University of South Carolina, there are 28 residence halls, all built slightly different, each endowed with their own challenges. By adopting a waste management plan like those seen in construction, buildings can address their specific problems while compiling data that is meaningful and uniform across campus. The plan includes a residential student, full time staff and housing custodial team sections. Due to the recycling crisis, landfill costs, increased hauler fees and more, this topic is very timely and one that we are faced with on a global scale. By having a waste management plan, university housing services can more effectively address specific issues, and target specific ways to reduce trash and recycle as they come up in each building. With the Theme of 'Global Goals: Rising to the Challenge,' This topic is very timely and hopefully a tool many housing coordinators can take back to their campuses to implement and inform their future work.",4756,,,,,,,Waste,Coordination & Planning,,,,Housing & Residence Life,,"residence halls,waste plans",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Laura Anne Hunt,4756,Housing Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Expanding the Horizons of Campus Recycling: Assessing Expanded Polystyrene Waste in Higher Education,"College and university campuses strive to minimize waste and promote thoughtful disposal practices among campus residents. However, one material that presents unique challenges to responsibly manage is expanded polystyrene (EPS), a plastic often referred to as Styrofoam. Valued for its structural and insulating properties, EPS is used in shipping containers for sensitive products in research laboratories. These properties become problematic once on campus, as the material cannot be included among plastics in recycling programs. Thus, EPS containers often are sent to landfill after a single use, to the consternation of laboratory staff and campus services employees. However, institutions of higher education can serve as proving grounds for novel waste management initiatives. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, students and staff have partnered with local actors to develop an EPS recycling program, successfully diverting EPS from landfill and extending its useful life. This program and its characteristics were featured in a session at the 2017 AASHE conference, with discussion focusing on lessons, ideas, and applications for institutions interested in mitigating EPS waste through approaches that employ the circular economy. This year's session will reprise the topic of EPS recycling and address an unanswered question from the 2017 conference: what are the environmental and economic outcomes of EPS waste mitigation practices? The presentation will be informed by the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the UW-Madison EPS recycling program. The LCA uses SimaPro software and measures the cradle-to-grave impacts of EPS across ten environmental categories. The LCA also assesses economic costs associated with the three disposal scenarios of landfill, recycling, and reuse. Discussion will revisit topics from the 2017 conference but focus on the implications of the LCA results for institutions engaged or interested in EPS recycling and reuse schemes.",4058,,,,,,,Waste,,,,,,,"styrofoam,recycling,life cycle assessment",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Tim Lindstrom,4058,Graduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9104/1430_Lindstrom_0414.pptx,,,
"Using Waste Audit Data to Drive Waste Reduction, Diversion, and Engagement","Unlike other utilities, such as electricity and natural gas, actual waste and recycling data are more difficult to track. The lack of ready to use data creates challenges in goal setting and tracking. Waste audits used to extrapolate this data are generally a onetime exercise. Collecting this data periodically involves creating a unique system that works in the local conditions of your institution. However, data without a plan is a waste of resources. Waste audits can fall into this trap so having a strategy for how audit data will be used is critical for success. Presenters will use the learnings from three different types of academic institutions to briefly discuss the many ways waste data can be collected and share how that data was used at their respective institutions to enact change. The four presenters will highlight how waste characterizations and audits do not have to be standalone assessments, that there is much to learn from collected data, and that these studies can be used to educate and engage the community and campus leaders, moving an institution's program towards greater reduction and diversion through a thoughtful process. This presentation will help the audience learn how to build engagement into the audit process, get feedback as a strategy is developed for applying the data, and set the program up for success in implementing change. The session aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12, to ensure sustainable consumption and production habits.",4748,4308,4916,2869,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"waste audits,data",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Julie Cahillane,4748,Northwestern University,Shantanu Pai,4308,Assistant Sustainability Researcher,Debra Kutska,4916,Sustainability Specialist,Rob Andrejewski,2869,Director of Sustainability, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8042/0915_Kutska_0455_1004_110121.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8042/0915_Kutska_0455.pdf,,
Thinking Outside of the Trash: Waste Policy Implementation and Education at Emory University,"Emory University consulted with Cascadia and Burns & McDonnell during 2016-2017 to assess Emory's materials management program and make recommendations for innovative and programmatic strategies to help Emory achieve its goal of 95% landfill diversion by 2025. Emory's first step after the consultants' work concluded was to create and seek approval for a new waste policy that removed landfill bins from exterior spaces, removed desk-side service of waste bins, standardized interior and exterior waste bins across campus, and established a new team of waste specialists to service the new system. This initiative is led by Emory Recycles, the Office of Sustainability Initiatives, Building & Residential Services, the Environmental Health & Safety Office, and the Planning Design & Construction departments. Emory University committed to this initiative to be a local leader and champion of SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities - and SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-Being. The Emory administration recognizes how critical it is to be a community steward and has communicated centrally about the social justice and environmental impacts of improper waste disposal. In this session, learn from members of the Emory Recycles and Office of Sustainability Initiatives teams about how and why Emory set its standards and how we approach outreach and engagement of students, faculty and staff.",3931,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"policies,recycling,receptacles",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Taylor Spicer,3931,Programs Coordinator,Kelly Weisinger,3931,Sustainability Staff,Deena Keeler,3931,Assistant Director of Auxiliary Services, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8079/1130_Weisinger_0505.pdf,,,
A Zero Waste Campus is Possible,"In this workshop we will facilitate student discussion around the waste crisis including the problems, solutions, and then empowering them to take action on their campuses. We draw on our national experience with campuses from across the country to highlight innovative ideas for how students can eliminate waste from campus by highlight the ways in which waste is a resources through which they can generate revenue, save their campus and student's money, and benefit the environment. Examples include, but are not limited to: move out collections, tool and bike shares, repair cafes, clothing swaps, campus thrift stores and more. We end with an exercise on power-mapping and discussing how students can take steps to implement change on their campuses: who to talk to, how to conduct those types of conversations, and where to turn when they face hurdles and challenges along the way.",6582,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,zero waste,10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Faye Christoforo,6582,"Co-Director, Campus Coordinator", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
A Residential Recycling Competition at Skidmore College,"Energy conservation competitions are a cornerstone project in many schools' outreach efforts, and this program utilized a similar approach to address apartment waste patterns. This recycling and compost-oriented competition involved on-campus apartments, which are often excluded from engagement efforts that focus on residence halls. The Village Recycling Competition (VRC) fostered collaboration with our waste hauler, provided insights to waste receptacle infrastructure, and bolstered support for the student-run composting program. This presentation explores the process, logistics, and takeaways from the Skidmore College Sustainability Office's two-month recycling competition. The VRC pitted two apartment villages against each other, including 22 buildings of about 1,000 junior and senior residents total. It was primarily organized by a team of six peer-to-peer education student employees. The programming cultivated awareness and behavior change with students that will be on campus for months or semesters to come, and yielded a survey to direct future educational outreach efforts and improve infrastructure that will be useful for years. Moving the needle on waste diversion in residential areas is a challenge across many campuses, including ours. The average recycling rate for Skidmore College is 30% for 2017, but the recycling rate within the apartment villages ranges from 10-30% month to month (this rate reflects routine zero-sort recycling and the MSW stream). This programming provided insight to behaviors and trends in the villages, which we incorporated into our educational materials through the competition and will inform our outreach in coming semesters. Skidmore College is a small, private liberal-arts college in upstate New York.",4696,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"competitions,recycling",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jennifer Natyzak,4696,Sustainability Coordinator for Student Programs, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9123/1430_Natyzak_0461.pdf,,,
Western State Colorado University Role in Advancing SDGs- Road Map to Institutionalizing Zero Waste,"Higher education plays critical roles in the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). More specifically, higher education should strategically strive in its physical operations in advancing the attainment of both SDG 12 (Sustainable consumption and production patterns) and SDG 13 (Urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts) through various measures despite limited budget. Such measures could include urgent actions (promoting zero waste culture) that will address the issue of climate change in achieving the Paris Agreement to hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2oC and to pursue efforts to limit the rise to 1.5 oC. At Western State Colorado University during the 2015-16 academic session, eight graduate students in the Master in Environmental Management program in partnership with Facilities, conducted a campus-wide waste audit with their results showing a diversion rate of 24% despite existing infrastructure being able to handle up to 72%. This led to strategically identifying several target areas for increased waste reduction. A year later, the President of the University institutionalized a goal to be a zero-waste campus (85-90% diversion rate) by year 2020. This meant that departments must ensure they minimize waste and recycle as much as possible to increase overall diversion. Collaboration efforts were intensified among three major departments (Residence Life, Athletics and Facilities) to pilot this process during the 2016-17 academic and results showed that diversion rates increased to 55-62% across those departments which increased the overall campus diversion rate to 35%. Another focused effort occurred in October 2017 when the University sought and was awarded a $25,000 RREO Mini-Grant from the State of Colorado to upgrade its recycling infrastructure. This will allow the purchase of new recycling bins with better labeling and education to further advance the zero-waste campaign goals.",1869,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"zero waste,waste audits,receptacles,waste diversion",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Ayodeji Oluwalana,1869,Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Accessible and Ethical E-Waste: Adaptability in Infrastructure,"This presentation is a case study on implementing an accessible and ethical e-waste system in UC Berkeley, where previously no affordable options had been available to students despite the hundreds of tons of e-waste the campus generates annually. The focus will be on how a program can be modular, especially in the face of limited funding and the transient nature of college campuses. The Zero Waste Research Center under the Student Environmental Resource Center is working on a solution to this problem. We have created an ethical and accessible system that can run on minimal resources. It relies heavily on student group and stakeholder interaction to ensure that our e-waste recycling program is constantly being updated to meet the campus's evolving needs. For collection, we will install bins in strategic locations in the residence halls and student union buildings. This will also be the basis of a map of e-waste collection sites with tagged data on the volume and type of waste we are receiving, as the university has not published data about its e-waste diversion since 2013. We are also screening our e-waste recycling partners to ensure that their process is both local and ethical, because we believe that the externalities of our waste should not simply be shifted to marginalized communities. Although we aim for biweekly pickups, there is a huge influx of e-waste when students move out. This is a problem unique to college campuses.",4473,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"e-waste,recycling",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Scott Silva,4473,Zero Waste Research Center Lead,Jenny Chiu,4473,Zero Waste Research Associate / Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
From Diversion to Prevention: Re-imagining Waste,"This is a story of a campus that has moved from seeing waste as merely a municipal bylaw, to diversion targets, and is now moving toward re-imagining waste as a tool for empowerment. Join this discussion to explore how to engage strategic allies like Human Resources professionals, videographers, and inquirers in the waste prevention journey. How can we begin to see waste as more than a Facilities Department responsibility, toward an initiative that can be built on collaboration, shared language, and experimentation? This presentation draws on pilot projects, including waste 'display cases', a cross-departmental 'Rapid Improvement Event', and a Repair Café to emphasis the experimental nature of waste aversion.

Off-Campus Student Housing Recycling Program,"Over 68 percent of students at the University of Nebraska Lincoln live in off-campus student housing, and many are conforming to the trend of residing in luxury student apartments. In an attempt to market to college students, apartment complexes offer workout rooms, pools, tanning beds, game rooms, study rooms, and an exclusive environment in which students can continue to live with students off of the university campus. In Lincoln, luxury apartment buildings have developed rapidly and can house thousands of students. While many of these apartments offer concierge trash services, none offered recycling services. Due to resources allocated by the University, the corporations that own their respected apartments, and the City of Lincoln, recycling in these apartments is being made possible. Though these apartments are unaffiliated with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the Environmental Sustainability Committee passed legislation through the Associated Students of University Nebraska-Lincoln that encouraged the development of recycling services in these apartment buildings. Unlike regular student government projects, we worked largely with the corporations that own the luxury student apartments. We also developed a relationship with the city of Lincoln, who was able to offer monetary incentives and assistance to the apartment buildings.

Engaging College Students With Sustainability and Human Rights Through Bottles and Cans,"The subject of my presentation will be UCan, a not-for-profit recycling system I launched as a first-year student at Colgate University in the Fall of 2017. UCan is a recycling system for universities and urban settings that collects, recycles, and redeems $0.05 deposit beverage containers and donates all proceeds to local hunger and homelessness outreach programs, such as affordable housing projects. Simply by disposing of beverage containers in UCan receptacles installed throughout campus, students learn about, support, and advocate for local environmental and human rights issues. At Colgate, over 40 UCan receptacles are installed in over 15 residential and academic buildings. Every week a team of student volunteers transports beverage containers from buildings to the redemption center, where containers are redeemable for cash. Then, UCan donates all proceeds to nonprofit organizations surrounding the participating university that directly serve and empower local homeless communities, and guide them through the process of safely transitioning out of homelessness, such as community-based affordable housing projects and hunger relief. The subject of the proposal is unique because it was founded with a two-fold mission: first, an environmental agenda to increase recycling rates at universities where bottle and can waste is produced in especially high quantities; second, a social agenda to help alleviate poverty in the area surrounding a university using the human resources, innovative spirits, and social awareness at the university's disposal. The presentation will focus on UCan Colgate's impact upon the surrounding city Utica, which is the 6th most distressed city in the United States with a poverty rate of 43%.

Achieving Zero Waste and Campus-Wide Compost Bins: Progress from Swarthmore College,"In 2017, Swarthmore College formalized its commitment to achieving a Zero Waste campus, with an interim goal of reaching an 80% diversion rate by 2022. This ambitious commitment, which built off of growing energy around composting and a developing need for a centralized campus waste yard, has since accelerated the College's waste innovations - placing it among other leaders of sustainable waste management in Pennsylvania and small liberal arts colleges nationwide, if not among the broader higher education community as well. We hope to share the progress that Swarthmore's program has made, offer a selection of tips and pitfalls, and solicit feedback from peer Zero Waste institutions. Swarthmore's recent waste initiatives include: -> Research and implementation of a standardized, campus-wide bin system. Each new 'waste station' has a color-coded set of compost (green), mixed recycling (blue), and incinerator trash (black) bins, with associated signage and other 'nudges' to encourage best sorting behavior. -> An educational campaign, developed by student researchers, to target ALL community members and - eventually - to ensure that every individual receives waste sorting training. -> A process for departments to volunteer to transition to Buddy Bins in office spaces, replacing traditional personal trash and recycling cans. -> Early development of designs for a centralized waste yard and associated staffing, landscape, and programmatic changes. -> Immense collaboration among departments of sustainability, custodial operations, auxiliary services, communications, and many more to identify unified strategies and visions.",3879,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"compost,zero waste,receptacles",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Christopher Proctor,3879,Sustainability Staff, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Engaging Housekeeping Staff for Zero Waste Success,"Contamination of single-stream recycling is one of the most significant obstacles to waste diversion. While campus culture promotes recycling, users do not reliably recycle correctly. The result is a contaminated recycling stream that does not meet strict guidelines set by the local MRF. To reduce contamination and increase waste diversion, Ohio State developed a program to leverage the unique position of housekeeping staff, which plays an integral role on the success of recycling efforts. Oftentimes, they are the first point of contact for student education about recycling and waste disposal guidelines. Housekeeping staff also play a crucial part on reducing waste contamination when sorting materials for pick up from buildings. This session will describe Ohio State's partnership with housekeeping staff to engage them to become educated ambassadors to the community, and be part of the university's effort to become a Zero Waste campus by the year 2025. Strategies that will be discussed include the development of a communications plan that addresses gaps in the staff's knowledge about recycling guidelines, and ways to communicate with native and non-native speaking staff.

University Zero Waste Research Center Networking Session,"The student-led Zero Waste Research Center at UC Berkeley works to create circular economies on the UC Berkeley campus by investigating innovative upstream and downstream solutions to campus waste problems. We know that other students and staff are working on zero waste research at other universities, and we feel that there is a disconnect in exchanging ideas and information between separate university groups. In this networking session, ZWRC at UCB will host students, staff, and faculty involved in zero waste research at their universities to have a discussion about the future of zero waste and how our work can serve as a model for the waste industry to handle waste resources more economically and efficiently. This networking meeting will give attendees a unique conference experience by connecting those who are working on innovative waste management practices, and allow for an exchange of ideas that can lead to solutions at other schools. We also hope to highlight the importance of a diversity of opinions and knowledge in zero waste projects through asking audience members to consider their project stakeholders and consider ways in which they can include more points of view in their work and teams. In an effort to maintain further collaboration amongst audience attendees, we will attempt get every attendees contact information to begin to create a database of students, staff and faculty working on zero waste research at universities, promoting communication amongst each other.",4473,,,,,,,Waste,Research,Public Engagement,,,,,"zero waste,student research",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Scott Silva,4473,Zero Waste Research Center Lead,Sharon Daraphonhdeth,4473,"Director, Student Environmental Resource Center",Jenny Chiu,4473,Zero Waste Research Associate / Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
How Might we Create a Sustainable Make-A-Thon to Inform Students About Sustainable Design?,"Design U every year puts on the 10,000 makes 24 hour Make-A-Thon where we bring in engineers, designers, business students and whoever else wants to join to essentially make something new. We start by giving them a how might we statement which goes along with our yearly theme. This year we chose Sustainability and Upcycling. This year the 10 Thousand Makes Make-A-Thon will took place in Ralph Rapson hall, which houses Architecture, and Design. The event happened on March 23 from 5:30-9:30 PM and March 24th 8:30 AM-7:30 PM. Up until this year sustainability has not been our main focus in Design U. Overall in the University of Minnesota College of Design, it isn't encouraged that students think of sustainable design, it is like we haven't even thought about it. As a team we sat down and had to think about our mission, we mainly wanted to think about impact and make sure that the Make-A-Thon would change how people perceive design, engineering and business. We decided to eliminate the plethora of resources and the individual teams budget to buy materials from Home Depot that the participants had in years past and use solely the reuse and recycling center on campus to get materials. All students were given a pile of reused/recycled materials to build their products from with few adhesives and all the tools from our wood shop, metal shop, and other labs on campus. This year alone we anticipated 70 participants, 14 teams and 14 mentors. We also reached out to key facility to mentor and assist the teams in making of their products. We had to think during our planning how might we keep Sustainability the focus of the event? We had meetings with the University of Minnesota Office of Sustainability who focus on direction and coordination for sustainability initiatives in the Twin Cities. They connected us to the reuse and recycling centers on campus to get materials for the Make-A-Thon but also gave us advice on making the event a road to zero waste.",32,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"upcycling,do-it-yourself (DIY)",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jessica Foor,32,Graphic Designer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Lessons From the Compost Pile: a Facilitated Conversation About Campus Compost Initiatives,"This meeting will focus on institutional compost collection and processing systems. It will be an opportunity to share experiences, ask questions, and connect with others engaged in campus composting efforts. We welcome educators, students, waste haulers, food service workers, communicators, and anyone else with an interest in compost to join the conversation. We will use compost production as a metaphor for the workshop learning process. The meeting will open with a brief case study to 'establish the culture of the compost pile.' University of Wisconsin-Madison staff will share how their university has taken a systems approach to addressing contamination in its food waste collection stream: working with stakeholders throughout the process. We will then turn to an activity to get a sense for who is in the room: 'assess our compost ingredients: our greens and browns.' This activity will give us information about the geographic distribution, experience with campus compost initiatives, and types of institutions represented in the group in order to start building connections between participants. Next, the group will generate questions related to campus compost initiatives. Each will be written on a sheet of flip chart paper and posted around the room. These will be our 'compost piles.' Participants will then sit or stand beside a question to which they feel drawn and strike up a conversation with the others gathered there.",4058,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,,,,,,"compost,food waste",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Ian Aley,4058,Green Fund Program Manager,Breana Nehls,4058,Sustainability Staff, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9827/1645_Nehls_0440.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8021/1645_Aley_0440.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8022/1645_Aley_0440.pdf,
Using Waste Reduction Technology to Adopt a Circular Economy,"This presentation will focus on waste management and the new shift to a circular economy. We will investigate the environmental and economic opportunities of a circular economy. We will study what this will look like along the entire make-use-dispose process, from resource extraction, processing, design, manufacturing, distribution, usage and finally disposal. The importance of improving resource productivity will be examined, designing products so that they can be reintroduced into the process as resources to create further value, while simultaneously minimizing and eliminating waste. We will also examine jurisdictions that have already successfully adopted a circular economy, we will look at what this will look like for our future and economy as we make this transition. We will investigate how cutting-edge technology is helping to fuel the shift to a circular economy. We will learn about the Resource Center, which is a free new software program that allows institutions to track and manage their refuse within their buildings at the container level. It acts as a roadmap to a better recycling program and a higher diversion rate, for no cost and can be accessed by anyone. This technology allows institutions to divide their organization up into divisions to separately track and direct waste management strategies to where they are most needed. The Resource Center takes a systematic approach, with attention to detail and lets institutions dive deep to see their progress in waste management, while making the transition to a circular economy more attainable for all.",6513,,,,,,,Waste,,,,,,,"circular economy,waste reduction,recycling",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Syvannah Vine,6513,Waste Diversion Specialist, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Identifying Holistic Metrics to Redefine Zero Waste,"While diversion has been the go-to metric for evaluating our waste reduction efforts, it skips over several levels of the waste reduction hierarchy, resulting in the prioritization of recycling and composting rates over source reduction and aversion. During this session, we will hear from two campuses who have been working with PLAN to Pilot a new framework that informs the creation of holistic, feasible plans to reduce campus waste production. We will discuss the types of qualitative data integral to understanding campus waste management operations, in addition to quantitative metrics that go beyond diversion.

Implementing an Effective Campus Recycling & Waste Bin Infrastructure,"A uniform system of well-designed recycling and waste bins is crucial for colleges to achieve significant diversion rates. The challenge is to identify bins that can address four key needs: operational efficiency, encourage correct recycling behavior, meet aesthetic standards, and fit within the budget. This session will go through the design considerations and institutional process to implement an effective bin infrastructure. Presentations will cover design attributes that anticipate and influence recycling behavior, as well as address ergonomic and other operational issues. Attendees will also hear a case study on the challenges and progress with UCLA's efforts to revamp their bin infrastructure across campus. Attendees will hear from and interact with experts in the collegiate, NGO and bin manufacturing sectors with over 60 years of combined of recycling experience.",4167,2197,,,,,,Waste,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"recycling,receptacles",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Bonny Bentzin,4167,Deputy Chief Sustainability Officer,Bruce Buchan,2197,Founder & CEO, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8447/0915_Buchan_0835.pdf,,,
"Bin There, Done That: Mapping CSUN's Outdoor Waste Infrastructure","To prepare for the implementation of CSUN's Zero Waste Plan, and to comply with new stormwater pollution mandates, the Facilities Planning department at CSU Northridge created an internship for students to map the campus' outdoor waste infrastructure. Through the Center for Geospatial Science and Technology, three students earned course credit for recording the location and various attributes of 738 outdoor waste receptacles including trash cans and recycling bins, over the course of a semester.

Resource Management Contracting- How It Can All Go Wrong When You Do Everything Right,"With stagnant recycling and diversion rates, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee sought to get aggressive with its haulers, data collection, and its plan for waste reduction. UWM set out to achieve a 50% diversion rate by substantially reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse beyond its average performance. By taking value from energy conservation's 'performance contracting' playbook, UWM put together an incentive-based approach to waste & recycling contracts, disrupting Milwaukee's hauling market. Early preparations involved peer to peer interviews, extensive community and campus stakeholder engagement, and third-party contracting. After setting out with high hopes, the program started to crumble within the first 6 months as contracts were sold, multi-departmental accounting problems unfurled, and service issues compiled, literally. All assumptions before and after laid to waste. This process exposed unaccounted for time invested in servicing the contracts and how challenging it is to build a program on cost savings alone. By exposing where the time and costs truly lie, UWM has been able to learn, reflect, and recoup with an even stronger, institutionalized process for aggressive waste diversion.",4059,,,,,,,Waste,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"waste reduction,waste diversion",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Kate Nelson,4059,Chief Sustainability Officer,John Gardner,4059,Sustainability Policy & Planning Analyst,Laura Stevens,4059,Solid Waste and Recycling Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7892/0830_Gardner_0311.pptx,,,
Zero-Waste Initiative: Composting at Events,"Public events tend to be extremely wasteful. When a county fair, culinary festival, fundraising campaign, or community garden potluck are organized, the overall aim is to create an enjoyable atmosphere. The issue of waste accumulation is not necessarily the primary focus. For the sake of immediacy, waste coordination of these events usually does not include the incorporation of services outside of landfill bins. Though recycling services are even less represented, the least considered waste service is that of organics diversion, or compost. Working for the University of Arizona Compost Cats has afforded the ability to facilitate many partnerships between local events and a student-operated commercial composting facility. The University of Arizona is located in Tucson, Arizona, which is a UNESCO City of Gastronomy. Since culinary events regularly occur within Tucson, the Compost Cats have been able to emerge within the events scene as a resource for providing compost bins and coaching to events staff. This involvement has led to a deeper discussion surrounding the perception of food waste within our communities. Most people who attend events in Tucson have never been exposed to the option of separating their leftover food from their plastic silverware and styrofoam plates, for example. The education of the public on the importance of compost is approached through the use of eco-stations which are monitored by volunteers or employees.",4465,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,Public Engagement,,,,,"compost,zero waste,events",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Grace McGuire,4465,"Operations Manager, UA Compost Cats",Kayenat Aryeh,4465,Undergraduate Student,Samantha Normandia,4465, UA Compost Cats, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Reducing Odorous Emissions from Compost With Bio Filters,"In 2014 Thompson Rivers University published its campus Sustainability Action plan that identified priorities to become a green campus. Zero waste was identified as a major priority, including the capturing of roughly 500 tones of organic waste a year. To this end, a composting program was created with two industrial Joracan composters, chosen for their high-speed computerized operation. Initially, the composters were in the Culinary arts building to provide easy access for kitchen and food scraps but after about a year, the machines began to produce odors; additionally, there were growing pains with compost collection in the form of fruit flies. If compost was not removed from an area quickly enough fruit flies would reach annoyingly high levels, this was initially solved using vinegar fly traps but is less of an issue now with more frequent pickups. The smell remained a more significant issue and proved harder to solve, after consulting Joracan, master composters, and having the machines regularly steam cleaned, nothing proved to be a permanent solution. Even after moving the composters to their own enclosed space, the exhaust from the machine often exceeded tolerable levels and the new location put the machine next door to campus daycare. By 2017, efforts to achieve zero waste were well underway, but the smell from the compost was causing complaints from staff, children, and concerned parents. With an end to the program looming over nuisance complaints the search to find a reliable, long term filtration option had already begun. After extensive market research, it was concluded that there was no economically viable commercial solution to this problem and research began on the concept of bio-filtration. Two filters were constructed and filled using untreated wood bark chips, and compost as the active microbial agent that breaks down volatile organic compounds.",1431,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,,,,,,"compost,zero waste",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Aaron Wiebe,1431,Research Assistant, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9282/1430_Wiebe_0632.pdf,,,
Composting and Organics Collection: Is it Happening On Your Campus?,"University and college campuses across the nation are increasingly adding food scraps collection and, often, the operation of compost or anaerobic digestion facilities to their 'green' portfolio to achieve STARS points or campus sustainability and zero waste goals. While every campus is unique, learning from the experiences and sharing of the trials and tribulations of other institutions can help jumpstart new programs and improve those in place. We want to bring together a facilitated discussion led by the University of Arizona Compost Cats--who are experienced in running their campus facility for both campus and regional use, are Rathmann Big Idea Challenge grant recipients, and leaders in the youth and college sector of the US Composting Council. They will be joined in facilitation by the USCC, the only US organization whose mission is leadership of the compost industry nationwide.",8316,4465,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,,,,,,compost,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Linda Norris-Waldt,8316,Communications Director,Chester Phillips,4465,Senior Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Building on Your Institutional Strengths to Reduce Food Waste,"Unity College had a small scale limited food waste collection system in the dining halls on campus. By working with a local partner, the food waste that could be collected expanded and is now sent to an anaerobic processing facility to be turned into energy. This not only greatly increased the amount of food waste collected each day, but also led to a culture of waste reduction being created in Unity's Dining Services. Learn from Unity's experiences of growing an existing program, how that has spurred interest on campus in other food and waste issues, & learn how you can build on your own institutions current infrastructure and local resources.",769,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,,,,,,food waste,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jonathan Gibbons,769,Sustainability Staff, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Can You Dig It?: Integrating Vermicomposting at UC Berkeley,"Our project was initially inspired by the work in progress at the CSU - Sacramento Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center (STORC). They are implementing a new processing system for their campus' organic waste that integrates vermiculture and aquaponics called the Multitrophic Sustainability System (MTSS). The bottommost layer of this system is a tank of fish who feed on worms from the vermicompost above, which produces the upper layer of finished compost where plants are grown. For our own campus, our goal is to process all campus organic waste in-house with three different composting systems: the MTSS, a windrow system and organics sorting facility, and vermicompost. The MTSS offers research opportunities on multitrophic ecosystems, closed-loop systems, and alternative gardening. The windrow system will be the main method of processing the large amount of waste a university campus produces. While the MTSS and windrow system are both integral parts of our long term plan, our current focus is on the vermicompost system. The vermicompost bin will act as a small-scale pilot to model and test our plans to process all campus organic waste. The 5x24 foot bin we plan to purchase can handle an input of 155 - 250 pounds of food waste per day, or an output of 693 - 1,040 pounds per week. We are currently coordinating with campus dining services, waste management, and the grounds/facilities department on the redirection of the correct amount of food and yard waste to the vermicompost bin. It takes five to six months for the first compost to finish, so we will also have that time to organize compost donations to local and campus gardens, namely the garden of the residence hall where the bin will be placed.",4473,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,,,,,,"vermiculture,compost,food waste,closed loop",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Alejandra Marquez,4473,UC Berkeley,Courtney McGuire,4473,"Undergraduate Student, Project Supervisor",Valerie Yong,4473,"Associate, Student Environmental Resource Center", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Rebel Rot: An Engineering Capstone Project to Convert a Dumpster into an In-Vessel Composter,"Building off a past AASHE presentation (2017) by Dr. Brian Barnes from the University of Louisville, the University of Nevada Las Vegas Sustainability Coordinator partnered with the College of Engineering to have three students convert a six cubic yard dumpster into an automated in-vessel composter. Dr. Barnes program inspired the presenter to see how U of L's model could be implemented at UNLV. However, the number of volunteers used by U of L presented a barrier to UNLV. To overcome the obstacle, Pike sought a means to automate the repurposed dumpster and utilized the Campus as a Living Lab model to achieve the outcome. The in-vessel composter is used for paper towels, coffee grounds, some food waste, and special event organic waste. The repurposed dumpster compliments UNLV's recently acquired used commercial eight cubic yard rotating drum in-vessel composter. The two projects were initiated at the same time in hopes that one would be accepted and implemented. Luckily, both projects became a reality. Between the two units, UNLV is making beautiful Rebel Rot compost. We are once again providing zero waste event/meeting services to the campus, and we have opened up the possibility for a zero waste student union. We are hoping to research the scalability of these types of units to hotel-casinos on the Las Vegas Strip corridor.

Building an Open Source Food Recovery Website: Pairing University Dining Halls With Shelters,"About one-third of food is wasted globally each year (Smith). Further, 30-40% of all food in the U.S. goes uneaten each year, resulting in 133 billion pounds of waste, worth $1 trillion USD (USDA, Smith). Also wasted is energy, labor, land use, and water involved in food production, resulting in 3.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (Smith). Close to 15% of American households struggle with food insecurity (USDA). The problems of food waste can be reduced by addressing several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Zero Hunger, Good Health and Well-being, Sustainable Cities and Communities, Responsible Consumption and Production, and Climate Action. With these goals in mind, we are implementing a human-centered design approach over three academic quarters in a directed research group comprised of interdisciplinary BS and MS students, where we are building an open source, interactive responsive food recovery website for pairing leftover university dining hall food with non-profit agencies in need. The goal of this website is to decrease the amount of food currently being composted while feeding people in need, and facilitating community involvement and mindfulness surrounding the topic of sustainability. Utilizing volunteer student delivery groups, the website will aid logistics in coordinating food deliveries between dining halls and shelters. In the future, an open source platform like ours could be adopted by higher education institutions.",4030,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,Public Engagement,,,,,"food waste,food recovery,websites",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Meghna Shrimanth Bhairappa,4030,Graduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7965/1400_Spyridakis_0382.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7958/1400_Bhairappa_0382_1020_011721.pdf,,
Integrated Plastics Recycling and Research Facility at UC Berkeley,"The Zero Waste Research Center at UC Berkeley is working to create the first Plastics Recycling Facility at UC Berkeley. This facility, located at the Global Bay Campus in Richmond, will process the University's plastic and recycling waste through proper collection, sorting, and redistribution. This project will allow for the University of California, Berkeley to expand recycling and reuse programs, reduce its carbon footprint, and create research and education opportunities for its students and the community of Richmond. We are working to incorporate 3-D printing into the project by reprocessing our plastic waste into 3-D printing filament. This project will be one of the first of its kind, and will greatly improve recycling efforts on university-wide and local levels. We will present visual examples of the materials recovery process, and will have hand on activities and discussions on waste management operations within other universities attending the workshop for the latter half of the presentation. This presentation will result in campus-specific upstream and downstream solutions to plastic waste on campus. Also, we will showcase how to find specific solutions to providing a circular economy for common waste items by recording diversion rates and finding particular business partners to take plastic waste. We will present local, non-chemically intensive methods for processing plastic waste to be used in the creation of consumer end products that have worked for the UC Berkeley campus. We will identify partnering businesses on a local level who may be interested in taking this material, and processing it for them in the way they prefer in order to make the exchange as easy as possible. These downstream solutions will provide important results that could be modeled between any university and local business, and are much more efficient at establishing a circular economy.",4473,,,,,,,Waste,Research,,,,,,"plastics,plastic reduction,recycling",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Scott Silva,4473,Zero Waste Research Center Lead,Sharon Daraphonhdeth,4473,"Director, Student Environmental Resource Center",Jenny Chiu,4473,Zero Waste Research Associate / Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9245/1430_Silva_0585.pdf,,,

Measuring Success - Auditing the Zero Waste Process,"At the Medical University of South Carolina we, like many campuses, are constantly improving our waste system in an effort to strive for 'Zero Waste'. During the 2016 RecycleMania competition we were given the opportunity to measure the effectiveness of our efforts. With the help of RubberMaid Commercial Products, we performed two consecutive waste audits with the third scheduled for March 2018. These audits provided insight into exactly what was going into our waste system and allowed us to measure the impact of improvements (installing backboards, grouping bins in stations, etc.), and allowed us to see opportunities in the waste stream such as food waste. We chose the first two floors of a mixed-use campus building as the area of study. The first audit assessed the effectiveness of our current waste system: 1) Recycling bins and trash cans spread throughout the floor-some together, some alone - After performing the audit and establishing a baseline for the two floors we improved the waste system. 2) Grouping recycling and trash bins in stations throughout the floors, equipped these bins with backboards displaying what can and cannot be placed in them. 3) Started distributing annual recycling guides campus-wide on America Recycles Day - We saw major improvements from these changes in our 2017 waste audit as well as some issues and opportunities. Our third round of improvements included: Implemented front-of-house composting; Redistributed annual recycling guide; Performed door-to-door education for composting. We are very interested in the results of our March Waste Audit. In our presentation we will give data from these three waste audits and will talk about the process, findings, and some challenges and tips for measuring the zero waste process.",3315,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"zero waste,waste audits",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,John Brooker,3315,Sustainability Communications Specialist,Christine von Kolnitz,3315,Sustainability Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9225/1430_Brooker_0560.pdf,,,

Trash Talking: South Dakota State University's Effort to Increase Campus' Recycling Rate,"Like most universities, it is not unusual to find trash and recycling in the wrong bin at South Dakota State University. Sparked by SDSU's STARS 2016 report, the campus Sustainability Specialist is currently on a journey to increase campus' recycling rate. In addition to the STARS report, previous waste audits concluded that SDSU has the potential to greatly increase the recycling quantity. After identifying campus' recycling rate could increase, the Sustainability Specialist conducted a simple survey. The survey asked students, faculty, and staff what they found confusing about recycling, what would motivate them to recycle, and how recycling information should be shared with campus. After analyzing the results, the Sustainability Specialist has been delivering the proposed plan to campus. This plan includes presenting to departments and student clubs about what can be recycled and distributing a simple, yet informative recycling guide. In addition, the poster will include education efforts that went alongside new recycling bins added to campus during spring 2018 and fall 2018. This poster will be a reflective overview of identifying the past barriers to recycling, implementing a responsive education campaign as well as the effort's successes and lessons learned. It will also show how dedication and enthusiasm play an important role in engaging campus in an often overlooked area.

Saving Water in University Library,"Being an urban campus the preservation of resources such as water are becoming more and more crucial. This project is a move in that direction, as well as that it serves as a visual representation of sustainability. This project involves retrofitting the 55 toilets within University Library with Dual Flush Low Flow Toilet Handles. The handles feature a typical downward flush for liquid waste, and an upward flush for solid waste, thus not requiring a behavioral adjustment from the user. Staff, students, and visitors alike will interact with this installation daily and will be reminded that there are sustainable choices that are not difficult to achieve. At this scale the project has a marginal impact on the IUPUI STARS score, however, if expanded campus wide it would have a greater significance due to the water saved. In addition, this installation is a one time project that will continue to impact IUPUI for years to come.",1353,,,,,,,Water,Buildings,,,,,,"water reduction,retrofits",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Amber Greaney,1353,Student,Dylan Patterson,1353,"Student, Office of Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
"Urban, Rural, and On-Campus Solutions (UROC): Living Campus Accelerator Toolkit","Arizona State University has committed to becoming carbon neutral for campus buildings by 2025. University Sustainability Practices (USP) is working tirelessly to help fulfill this vision. USP and partner universities from Mexico City, Dublin, London, Hong Kong, and Lüneburg in the Global Consortium for Sustainability Outcomes (GCSO) are tackling CO2 emissions reduction by reducing 'unnecessary' hot water on campuses as a pilot climate solution to scale globally. By engaging students, staff, and faculty, USP is redefining how hot water is perceived. This initiative is helping to address Sustainable Development Goals #9 and #11: industry, innovation and infrastructure; sustainable cities and communities. Reducing 'unnecessary' hot water encourages utilizing existing infrastructure to be more sustainable, making ASU more resilient. As recognized by health professionals, hot water is not as effective as cold water for sanitation in hand washing. By eliminating the energy used to heat such water, carbon emissions are significantly reduced. Facilities management took the lead in monitoring energy use in four pilot buildings on the Tempe campus. For two months, hot water was eliminated from the restrooms in these buildings to measure potential energy costs savings for ASU and to gauge social and behavioral impacts. Currently, the extrapolated energy savings are estimated to be 2% of the total Tempe campus energy use! Those savings translate into carbon emission reductions.",4531,,,,,,,Water,Campus Engagement,Energy,,,,,"hot water,energy reduction",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Kayla Kutter,4531,Graduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7897/1400_Kutter_0314.pptx,,,

On-Campus Water Reclamation: A Tale of Two Cities,"Think globally. Act locally. Water is a critical issue in many parts of the world. See how Emory University and Arizona State University have turned to on-campus water reclamation as a way to address water sustainability and resilience. The WaterHub at Emory is an on-site water recycling system using engineered processes that emulate natural ecological systems to reclaim wastewater for heating and cooling buildings and toilet flushing. Resembling a greenhouse, the WaterHub is a living laboratory for research and teaching and for showcasing the capacity of operations to play a major role in water conservation. The first system of its kind in the US, it has the capacity to supply nearly 40% of Emory's total campus water needs. The facility relieves an over-burdened municipal system, saves Emory money over time, and reduces the use of potable water by over 400,000 gallons per day. Through the WaterHub docent program Emory students are trained to lead public tours for groups from around the world. The WaterHub at Emory served as an inspiration to Arizona State University to investigate a similar game-changing solution to its water goals. ASU is located in the desert southwest where nationally-recognized state groundwater law and municipal water management have ensured supply and kept water rates low for a generation. But a persistent drought calls for new solutions. ASU has studied the feasibility of 'WaterWorks', a reclamation project that could reduce ASU's potable water demand by over 35% at its largest campus while supporting cutting-edge research. With water rates less than half those in Atlanta and with a sophisticated, layered regional reclamation network already in place, the situation has quickly become very complex and the solutions potentially even more layered and complex. Two very different universities experiences can help inform what factors to consider and what solutions might work for your campus water goals.",4531,3931,2298,,,,,Water,Coordination & Planning,Curriculum,,,,,"water reclamation,water reduction",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Mick Dalrymple,4531,"Director, University Sustainability Practices",Ciannat Howett,3931,Director of Sustainability,Bob Salvatelli,2298,Director of Sales, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10298/0915_Salvatelli_0953.pdf,,,
Harvesting Hope for the Future Through Green Infrastructure,"Tucson is situated in one of the most arid regions of the world. Consequently, conserving water for the use of both people and the environment is of utmost importance. Doing so in a way that accentuates the natural aesthetic beauty of the Sonoran Desert, while also providing a functional, sustainable solution to rain water mitigation, water conservation, and urban heat island effects is the ultimate goal. The University of Arizona is at the forefront of green infrastructure. One area on campus in particular that excels in making use of water is the UA Community Garden. Located there, are three significant infrastructure installations. A 28,000 gallon active harvesting cistern that collects rain from the Highland Garage for use in the garden, a series of runoff basins for the occasions when the active cistern overflows, and the newly constructed pollinator garden passive basin that diverts rain from the bike path and encourages percolation into the aquifer. The combination of these three projects have allowed a previously barren lot to become transformed into a lush garden oasis. In this presentation, the process of planning and designing water-smart green infrastructure will be addressed, along with how to overcome the obstacles of working with grounds management, and remediate basin troubles. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential for engaging the community through water harvesting.",4465,,,,,,,Water,Coordination & Planning,Grounds,,,,,"rainwater,stormwater,water conservation",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Catherine Riedel,4465,Students for Sustainability,Allison Doty,4465,Off-Campus Housing Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8206/0830_Riedel_0606.pptx,,,

Redefining Sustainable Campuses and Development Through the Lens of Health and Wellness,"Our understanding of how the built environment impacts health and wellness has increased significantly in recent years; however, the human and social elements of sustainability are frequently given less attention than they deserve. Now, new development frameworks focused on health and wellness for shapers of the built environment have been brought to market that are providing an opportunity for focused improvements of how we develop, build, and operate healthy buildings, campuses, districts, and beyond. This presentation will focus primarily on health and wellness optimizations that can be made at the campus construction and operational level to bring sustainability to new levels, but there will be links for how various items enable the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, this session will touch on the following SDGs: Good Health and Well-being; Clean Water and Sanitation; Affordable and Clean Energy; Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure; Reduced Inequalities; Sustainable Cities and Communities; Responsible Consumption and Production; and Climate Action. The presenters will provide material from four rating systems - the WELL Building Standard, Fitwel, EcoDistricts, and the Living Community Challenge - and drill into how many of their elements can enable developers, owners, and practitioners in the built environment to work towards the targets and indicators of the previously identified UN SDG's. Lastly, the seminar will conclude with a look at some of the research documenting the impact of the built environment on health and wellness, and outline opportunities for expanded research activities in this area.",6798,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Buildings,,,,,,"building occupants,wellness",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Steven Burke,6798,"Consigli Construction Company, Inc.", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8885/1430_Burke_0146.pdf,,,

Innovation: Creating a new Minor in Somatic Sustainability at Appalachian State University,"Awakening somatic intelligence and understanding sustainable body practices are important aspects of an enlarged conversation of sustainability. As a part of that dialogue, we have created a new minor in Somatic Sustainability at Appalachian State University focusing on the cultivation of body awareness and mindfulness through somatic practice in relation to current principles of sustainability. When considering our whole being, any situation that affects our physical body reverberates in our cognitive, emotional, and spiritual being, as well. Contextualizing somatic practices within the three more commonly understood elements, or 'legs' of sustainability- economics, the environment and social justice from an energetic body perspective are critical and timely. The minor offers an introductory foundation of possibilities for relational ways of thinking and understanding our embodied actions as they impact our sustainability. Somatics, as an emerging field within academia, offers an additional lens for transformation to start from within one's self. Placing somatic work as relational to sustainable practice is claiming the importance of kinesthetic learning and self awareness as a vehicle for growth and change. Bridging a foundational range of somatic practices such as Yoga, Pilates and Gyrokinesis with course work in Sustainable Development has allowed an embodied perspective of sustainability in academia to emerge.",4398,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,"somatics,wellness",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Laurie Atkins,4398,"Associate Professor, Dance Studies",Marianne Adams,4398,"Professor, Dance Studies", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7971/1400_Atkins_0389.pdf,,,
This Justice In: Updated Results From the Living Wage Policy Study,"This session will provide the most recent results from the Living Wage Policy Study, a five-year multi-phase research project exploring the prevalence and nature and living wage policies in American higher education. This project uses a rubric based on the Model Just Employment Policy, which was prepared by the Harrison Institute for Public Law and the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor at Georgetown University. The Living Wage Policy Study examines institutional performance metrics to assess the potential effects of living wage policies, including operating margins, bond ratings, institutional rankings/reputation, and media coverage, among others. Wherever possible, the study also explore show living wage policies came into existence. The most comprehensive living wage policies cover both the institution's direct employees and its contractors' employees. Given the ubiquitous outsourcing across higher education, a policy requiring that contractors' employees be paid a living wage may be a much larger financial commitment than a policy covering only to direct employees. A living wage policy that excludes contractors inevitably raises questions of justice, fairness, and respect for everyone working on a campus. Thus, instead of enacting a living wage policy, a number of institutions engage in unpublished living wage practices, ensuring that direct employees are paid a living wage, but not treating contractors' employees similarly.",674,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"living wage,employee compensation,policies",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Ken Weidner,674,Assistant Professor of Management, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8298/1130_Weidner_0676.pdf,,,
"Well-Being for All, Sustainably at Dawson College","Institutes of higher education may be populated with many people, but they can be lonely places for staff and students alike. Stress is also prevalent in our schools. An ever-increasing body of evidence demonstrates that contact with nature develops well-being and can also be an important part of transforming education. Connecting with nature is associated with positive emotions and recognized as a significant restorative agent. In fact, it has been demonstrated that Nature's beneficial effects go beyond mere restoration by positively enhancing true mental health and well-being and can help mitigate stress. In 2016, Dawson College adopted its third-generation Strategic Plan, highlighting ""well-being for all, sustainably"" as a core value. There are many aspects of well-being and a variety of definitions exist in academic and policy literature. Seligman identifies well-being theory as having five major elements: positive emotion, engagement, positive relationships, meaning and accomplishments. In addition, wellness as an extension of health is also defined as connected to the health of the natural environment, spiritual wellness and physical wellness. This workshop will showcase the many initiatives Dawson College has taken to ensure well-being for its employees and how these initiatives, such as our Monarch Butterfly Program, Peace Garden, rooftop gardening and participation in a Sustainable Happiness Certificate program, are impacting employee satisfaction and engagement.",4714,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"nature,wellness",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Chris Adam,4714,Director - Sustainability Office,Katherine McWhaw,4714,"Coordinator, Quality Assurance & Planning Office", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8001/1045_McWhaw_0415.pptx,,,

Sustaining our Communities Through Care and Action,"Sustainability is becoming more expansive; ideas about social and economic justice and human health are becoming integrated into the environmental field. But is this holistic ideal replicated in the way we do our work? Our institutions are full of passionate people eager to take on challenges, yet many of us are feeling burned out and frustrated. Why is this? Are we reproducing the very injustices we are working against in the structure of our movements? This workshop will serve as a starting point to think about how community care principles can be incorporated into our organizations to better address complex issues. To have transformative change in our world we need to treat each other, our environment, and ourselves with respect and care. We must build institutions that embrace justice as a guiding principle and act accordingly. To accomplish this requires intentional work within our communities including recognizing and acting against structural injustices, sharing skills, knowledge, and workload, and empowering marginalized groups. We must also care for and support each person in our networks by reducing hierarchies and egos and advocating for each other. Everyone must examine their own power and privilege and commit to continual and lifelong self-education and active work.

Along with including robust environmental goals, BHSU took a holistic approach by including wellbeing and diversity in their plan. While these types of goals are common in strategic planning and other efforts, BHSU found it imperative to include them in their sustainability planning to ensure a well-rounded approach. The vision for BHSU is that wellbeing will become a concept that is embraced at all levels of the university in order for all participants of the community to thrive in relation to themselves, to one another and to nature. A university culture that embraces wellbeing can be expected to see increased rates of student, staff and faculty recruitment and retention, more innovation, greater job satisfaction, fewer health-related absences and a greater sense of equity and inclusion on campus. Similarly, a sustainable society thrives between the boundaries of a just social foundation and a healthy environment. As BHSU works to create a more sustainable university, it is essential that it work to ensure that its community is diverse, inclusive and fair. In nature, the greater the amount of diversity in an ecosystem, the healthier and more productive it will be. Greater species diversity ensures greater sustainability for all life forms in ecosystems.",8491,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Diversity & Affordability,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"sustainability plans,wellness",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Kim Morrow,8491,Senior Associate, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9911/0830_Morrow_0722.pdf,,,
Everett Community College Sustainability Volunteer Program Gets People Working,"Video proposal (20 minutes/10 Minute Q&A) Since 2009, The Everett Community College Sustainability Department has teamed with several local agencies to fund a paid 'volunteer' program on campus. Volunteers from more than 35 countries and more than 50 Nationalities have participated in this work experience program which helps people immigrating to the United States find gainful, full time employment. Since its inception, nearly 75% of the participants who complete the program find full time work in 6 months or less. The program also provides a valuable service to the campus, by ensuring that single stream recycling is available to every EvCC site, while saving the college a combined 120,000 annually in staffing and service costs. All the while, keeping tons of campus recyclables out of landfills. The video will include a couple from Nepal, who are currently working in the program at the college; a participant who completed the program and was hired full time by the college; and a participant who completed the program and was hired elsewhere in the community. Members of the college departments impacted by or working with the volunteer program will also be included, as well as program coordinators from Refugee and Immigrant Services of Snohomish County, who help get funding for volunteer participants.",4087,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Waste,,,,,,"workforce development,refugees,recycling,immigration",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Molly Beeman,4087,Sustainability an Capital Projects Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Shaping Perceptions: Creative Explorations of Personal & Community Resiliency Through Art & Movement,"Life is stressful, and perception can hamper our ability to tackle our seemingly endless to-do lists. This workshop aims to equip participants with mechanisms to increase tolerance and productivity and enhance overall well-being by investigating perception through creative means, guided by decades of experience as artists and educators. This interactive and engaging workshop is based on the premise that re-framing and reassessing our patterned impressions of the world shifts paradigms and opens doors. We invite participants to explore their curiosities and challenge their assumptions through three complementary segments: 1.) touch-based drawing exercises, 2.) whole body movement, and 3.) sensory integration, strengthening the mind-body connection and broadening perceptions and environmental awareness in the process. The drawing exercises will encourage participants to actively investigate textures and shapes of unknown objects using only their sense of touch. Working individually and as teams, participants will learn techniques to navigate through life's unknowns and ambiguities by activating the sense of touch and delaying the ability to immediately label a variety of objects. These exercises will challenge the stockpile of fixed mental images and assumptions of the surrounding world by fostering a creative dialogue between the labeling mind and bodily senses. During Parts 2 and 3, participants will learn to harness the power of movement and stillness.",5047,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,,,"arts & culture,wellness",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Ashley Lynn Lavender,5047,Student Programs Coordinator and Faculty,Steve Johnson,5047,"Department of Studio Art, College of Charleston", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
How a College Student Turned His Campus Sustainability Program Into a Fortune 500 Company,"As a student at Oberlin, Vladi Shunturov gained his passion in buildings and was determined to find a way to make the built environment more sustainable and efficient. Vladi and a team of research students created a technology that pulled energy data from 'dumb buildings' into a computer program, brining energy and facility management out of the basement and into the digital world. This idea evolved over time, and Lucid BuildingOS was born into a company that would serve over 500 of the largest institutions in the world from higher ed, to tech, to government and beyond. Join this inspirational session to learn how a couple of college students, a passion for sustainability, and one great idea sparked a global movement to make the built environment more efficient for all.",5709,,,,,,,Buildings,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"data,metrics",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Vladi Shunturov,5709,President, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10300/1045_Shunturov.pdf,,,
