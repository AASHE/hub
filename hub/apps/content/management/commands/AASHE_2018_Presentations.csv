Greenhouse Gas Inventory of the University of Pittsburgh,"As greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere and have an impact on climate, identifying and monitoring the sources of these emissions becomes increasingly important. Because residential and commercial buildings account for 40% of total US energy consumption [1], analyzing structures within this building stock and thereby identifying areas for improvement has the potential to significantly decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Additionally, the University is a member of the Architecture 2030 Pittsburgh District, thereby committing to reducing energy use, water use, and transportation emissions by 50% by the year 2030. [2] In order to monitor any progress being made towards these goals, the University of Pittsburgh has conducted a campus-wide greenhouse gas inventory for Fiscal Years (FY) 2008, 2011, 2014, and is in the progress of updating the inventory for FY17. Data on energy consumption, transportation, and waste was collected from various departments across campus. After the data was collected, it was entered into a tool called the Campus Carbon Calculator, which was published by The Sustainability Institute at the University of New Hampshire. [3] This tool is an Excel-based spreadsheet that is designed specifically for the assessment of greenhouse gas emissions of institutions; it combines various emissions factors and other standard practices in order to calculate GHG emissions. Although FY17 data is still being analyzed, the FY14 inventory showed that a shift away from coal, while increasing nuclear powered electricity, resulted in a drop in CO2e by 15,000 metric tons. Because there are annual changes in the campus building stock, energy mix, as well as various other factors, the inventories may not show an overall clear decrease in greenhouse gas emissions; however, decreases in any given sector represent progress. This inventory will continue to identify large potential reduction areas in order to help achieve city goals by 2030.",760,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Energy,,,,,,emissions reporting,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Haley Gardner,760,Graduate Student Researcher,Melissa Bilec,760,"Faculty, Civil and Environmental Engineering", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9151/1430_Gardner_0486.pdf,,,
Campus & Community Resilience: Experiences from Community College & University Partnerships,"Campuses in Portland, Los Angeles, and Phoenix were involved in the Climate Resilience in Urban Campuses + Communities (CRUX) project to support the implementation of resilience-related elements of the colleges and universities Climate Commitment. Since the winter of 2017 these campuses - located in dense urban areas with various at-risk populations - worked collaboratively to develop their own campus-community resilience assessments and begin the planning stages for campus resilience strategies. Through this process, each cluster has developed innovative resilience assessment tools and have completed resilience demonstration projects useful for the entire higher ed. community. Campus demonstration projects include; resilience curriculum, heat mapping, future visioning exercises, resilience building workshops, tree planting, water cisterns, stormwater retrofits and other green infrastructure initiatives. Community projects included; partnerships and mapping applications at the municipal level, integration with existing emergency response planning teams, community tree plantings, community workshops and information sessions (NOAA) regarding climate resilience and preparedness. Participants in this session will learn about the progress of the CRUX project over the last year (since the last AASHE conference) and gain insights into the lessons learned from the campuses involved. We will discuss partnerships between the institutions and increased cohesion between campuses and their communities.",4531,2515,1248,123,,,,Air & Climate,Public Engagement,,,,,,"resilience,community colleges,inter-campus collaboration",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Brian Grant,4531,CRUX Fellow/Climate Resilience Program Assistant,Thea Kindschuh,2515,Assistant Planner for Climate Resilience,Corey Hawkey,4531,Assistant Director,Austin Eriksson,1248,Director of Energy and Sustainability,Erica Wohldmann,1248,"Interim Director, Institute for Sustainability; Professor",Gina Stovall,123,Cross-Sector Climate Manager, ,,, ,,,,,,
Advancing Carbon Pricing at Your Institution ,"Carbon pricing is a fair, feasible, and powerful solution to accelerate a transition to a clean energy economy. With a growing number of carbon pricing policies around the world and building momentum in the US, higher education (HE) has an opportunity to advance an important national dialog. We will explore how schools can engage with carbon pricing: internal carbon fees on departments; proxy carbon prices for capital decision making; direct endorsement of legislative solutions; and student and community engagement in carbon pricing work. Internal carbon pricing models provide a framework for integrating climate in cost benefit analysis, financing for sustainability work, and can create a platform for engaging the campus community on climate solutions. We will share models of both internal prices levied on departments and offices within a school, and proxy pricing tools that are used in cost/benefit analysis in institutional decision making. As thought leaders, HE institutions have a responsibility to bring attention to strategic, effective solutions to challenging problems. Finally, HE works to educate and prepare our students and communities to engage with and solve big problems. We'll share strategies for educating and engaging the campus about climate policy, and empowering students to take action in their communities to advance climate solutions on the national stage.",3879,3678,4705,,,,,Air & Climate,Campus Engagement,,,,,,carbon pricing,10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Nathaniel Graf,3879,Sustainability Staff,Casey Pickett,3678,Director of The Carbon Charge,Aurora Winslade,3879,Director of Sustainability,Alex Barron,4705,Assistant Professor - ES&P, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
The Role of Campuses in Driving Climate Resilience Planning,"As impacts from climate change intensify, a growing number of initiatives are emerging to increase resilience locally and globally. Campuses across the US are stepping up to prepare for climate change and serve as leaders in their communities. This session explores the roles that three schools are playing in driving climate resilience, both on campus and in the surrounding community. Presenters will discuss how their schools are serving as models of climate resilience planning and developing relationships with the community, particularly in the context of global initiatives such as 100 Resilient Cities and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The presentations and discussion will address questions about how higher education institutions can align their teaching, research, campus operations and cross-sector collaborations in support of SDGs for sustainable cities and communities, climate action and partnerships for sustainable development. University of Illinois at Chicago and University of California Los Angeles, both signatories of the Climate Commitment, will share experiences assessing resilience on campus and collaborating with city partners to plan for increased climate resilience. Dickinson College, the first to use the City Resilience Index tool outside of 100 Resilient Cities, will share its experience assessing resilience for the town of Carlisle, PA. This moderated panel will be followed by Q&A and interactive discussion with the audience.",3185,4167,1541,123,,,,Air & Climate,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,"resilience,climate change",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Neil Leary,3185,"Director, Center for Sustainability Education",Nurit Katz,4167,Chief Sustainability Officer,Cynthia Klein-Banai,1541,Associate Chancellor for Sustainability,Ruby Woodside,123,Innovative Services Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
"Putting A Price On Carbon: Fighting for Strong Climate Policy on the Campus, State and Federal Level","We already face the disastrous impacts of climate change: unprecedented droughts and heatwaves, stronger hurricanes, ocean acidification, sea level rise, the spread of infectious disease. The cost of these changes is born by everyone, especially communities of color, low-income households, and future generations. Or rather, almost everyone. The multi-trillion-dollar industry that sells fossil fuels and the consumers that burn them currently do so for free. Carbon pricing policy is a powerful way to make polluters rather than people pay for the true cost of burning fossil fuels. This market-based approach has conservative as well as liberal support in the US. Many governments around the world that price carbon have already begun to reduce emissions while making a just transition to clean and renewable energy. But to get across the finish line, this policy needs a champion. As the generation with the most to lose, young people are uniquely persuasive advocates for climate solutions. Decision-makers respond to young people in a way they don't to other groups, especially when we call for fair, science-based, economically sound policies like this. That is why Our Climate, a Seattle-based nonprofit founded and run by millennials, trains and supports student leaders across the country to deliver our generation's most critical ask--to #PutAPriceOnIt now before we end up paying a much larger price later.",8294,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,"carbon pricing,advocacy",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Eben Bein,8294,Northeast Field Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Assessing Campus and Community Resilience in Rural America,"Rural colleges and universities face unique considerations when assessing campus and community climate resilience. While there are common elements to resilience at any institution, the political and economic landscape for campuses in rural regions of the US is often very different from that of urban or coastal areas. Join this session to hear from rural schools that recently completed climate resilience assessments. Each school will discuss how they identified assets, vulnerabilities, and initial indicators of resilience both on campus and in the surrounding communities. Presenters will focus especially on opportunities and challenges unique to rural areas, however the process will be relevant for all schools addressing resilience. Green Mountain College will describe their experience working the Community Resilience Organizations (CROs) Assessment tool and how they used the resilience assessment and the creation of a resilience plan to provide student learning opportunities. Central Community College will share how they assessed resilience at campuses in four different communities and combined the results into a final comprehensive assessment.",4372,123,1195,,,,,Air & Climate,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,"resilience,rural focus",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Olivia Whittaker,4372,Environmental Sustainability Manager,Ruby Woodside,123,Innovative Services Manager,Ryan Ihrke,1195,Director of Sustainability,Benjamin Newton,4372,Environmental Sustainability Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8959/1430_Newton_0247.pdf,,,
Creating Positive Impact and Achieving Sustainability Goals through Custom Carbon Reduction Projects,"How can your institution achieve more through your climate goals? Carbon offsets and RECs have long been an effective way of addressing the environmental impacts of running an academic institution or business. However, these strategies leave many organizations desiring more from their carbon offset or REC purchase. In this session, NativeEnergy will provide case study examples of how organizations have achieved their climate goals and created more value for their stakeholders and institutions by creating custom carbon reduction projects that are aligned with their mission and core activity areas. Whether it is projects located in study abroad locations, carbon reduction projects with specific academic curriculum integrated into them and more.

Leverage Your Renewable Energy Impact Through Emerging Avoided Emissions PPA Strategies ,"Renewable energy procurement is a critical strategy for reducing an institution's greenhouse gas emissions. However, not all renewable energy projects avoid the same amount of GHG emissions per kWh. The 20+ electrical grids and subregions of the US vary widely in their carbon intensity, from over 1,700 lbs CO2e/MWh in the mid-west to ~650 lbs CO2e/MWh in New England and CA. Choosing a project in a more carbon intensive grid rather than your potentially less intense local grid can therefore dramatically increase the actual GHG emissions avoided by your renewable energy choice. This workshop brings together the researchers developing these techniques with the practitioners employing them. We will provide a case study of how Boston University successfully worked with both private and academic partners to choose the renewable energy project that was best for both the University and the planet. This workshop will: Provide a process for campuses to identify renewable energy project selection criteria Share analytical tools to align GHG reduction efforts with energy and financial needs Review carbon emission accounting practices including traditional and marginal emission approaches using data synthesized by researchers at Carnegie Mellon Univ., Examine renewable energy project electricity production profiles to understand how to predict a project's future electricity production.",2246,2849,6898,5184,,,,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,Energy,,,,,"renewable energy,power purchase agreements (PPAs)",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Dennis Carlberg,2246,Sustainability Director,Inês Azevedo,2849,Professor,Gavin McCormick,6898,Executive Director,Casey Kelly,2246,Student,Christen Blum,5184,Managing Director, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8257/1300_Carlberg_0641.pptx,,,
From Incremental to Transformative Climate Action: Lessons Learned From Addressing Barriers,"What are the most fundamental and challenging barriers to achieving carbon neutrality at a large research university? The first University of California campus to publish a climate action plan (CAP) did so more than 10 years ago. All 10 UC chancellors signed the ACUPCC in 2007 and completed a CAP by 2009. Each campus updated their CAP in 2016 to map out the path to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025. However, in retrospect, it is not clear that the previous CAPs resulted in anything beyond incremental actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, in 2016 the UC system established a high-level Task Force on Carbon Neutrality Management to identify the most significant barriers to achieving the 2025 goal and to develop recommendations for overcoming those barriers. The Task Force published its report in fall 2017 with a list of recommendations developed through extensive consultations with over 200 stakeholders. Those recommendations were approved by UC President Janet Napolitano and presented to the 10 campus chancellors and Board of Regents. In parallel, UC researchers received a grant from the TomKat Foundation to launch two year-long applied research projects: (1) a natural gas exit strategy; and, (2) a change management and communications strategy to get support for the necessary transformative changes. This panel will share the insights gleaned from trying to move beyond incremental climate action to transformative change.",4144,4167,,,,,,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,Public Engagement,,,,,"barriers,inter-campus collaboration,emissions reduction",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Matthew St.Clair,4144,Director of Sustainability,David Phillips,4144,Associate Vice President of Energy and Sustainability,Ann Carlson,4167,Shapiro Professor of Environmental Law, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8375/1400_StClair_0767.pptx,,,
Boston University's Climate Action Plan and The Public Process,"Boston University's Climate Action Plan provides a roadmap to address energy use and sourcing, resiliency and climate preparedness, transportation, supply chain, and waste. Moreover it recommends the creation of an academic initiative that will catalyze climate change-related research and the Plan's integration into BU's Strategic Plan. The task force engaged the BU community in the development of the Plan and provided a strategy to convey individual ownership of and responsibility for the actions required to realize the Plan. They also engaged the City, state, and neighboring institutions to explore shared solutions that benefit the broader community. The Climate Action Plan was developed in 2017 following two years of divestment advocacy by students and faculty, a review of the divestment issue by the Advisory Committee for Socially Responsible Investing (a committee of the Board of Trustees), and finally a charge from the President. A faculty-led task force, including some staff and students, developed the Plan's recommendations. Under the Plan, the University is committed to achieve zero net emissions to operate its facilities and fleet by 2040. Part of this effort will be to reduce energy use 31% by 2032, upgrading equipment and infrastructure. Additionally, the University will negotiate a power purchase agreement for 100% of its load to support the construction of a new renewable energy project. The Plan includes recommendations to prepare the campuses for the impacts for the change that can't be avoided from rising seas, storm flooding, heat waves, and wind by addressing new planning and construction standards and the relocation of critical functions. Recommendations regarding indirect emissions include: build capacity to more accurately measure scope 3 emissions, work with vendors to promote the sourcing of sustainable products and services and pilot a Zero Waste program.",2246,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,climate action plans,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Lisa Tornatore,2246,Assistant Director for Sustainability,Dennis Carlberg,2246,Sustainability Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Approaches to Carbon Offset Procurement,"This presentation will feature a diversity of institutions and their approaches to carbon offset procurement in pursuit of carbon reduction goals. The institutions represented on this panel share the perspective that similar to recycling's reduce, reuse, recycle mantra, carbon neutrality goals should follow a reduce, renew, offset prioritization. Internal reductions and the adoption of renewable energy sources are pursued before carbon offset procurement. Still, for institutions with fast-approaching carbon neutrality deadlines, carbon offsets can be an impactful instrument in the climate change toolkit. Offsets, like other investments in emissions reduction, can offer many beneficial outcomes beyond their primary goal of achieving a reduction; distinguishing between offset projects can be a time-consuming process that requires analysis and judgment. Institutions need to apply values and principles to guide investments in offset credit purchases in order to maximize ROI (in tonnes CO2e), and weigh additional value like positive PR, possible student research opportunities, the location of projects, and health, lifestyle, and aesthetic benefits. This panel will begin with Ruby Woodside from Second Nature who will cover the context of carbon offsets within higher education climate commitments, and then discuss the values and missions that guide carbon offset purchase decisions within the University of California system, at Duke University, and at Colgate University.",4473,123,4155,1336,,,,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,carbon offsets,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Barbara Haya,4473,Research Fellow,Ruby Woodside,123,Innovative Services Manager,John Pumilio,4155,Director of Sustainability,Matthew Arsenault,1336,"Program Manager, Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7984/0915_Woodside_0404.pdf,,,
OffsetNetwork.org: Higher Ed's Hub for Self-Generated Offset Projects and Peer Verification,"The Offset Network is an online platform for colleges and universities to share experience, lessons learned and tell the stories behind developing their own carbon offset projects. The site provides guidance for schools considering developing their own emission reduction projects. Self-generated offsets offer greater flexibility than market-purchased credits, opening the door to added value through connection to academic mission and impacting nearby communities through project co-benefits. This presentation will provide the offset market context, self-generated projects fill, and how these credits can be applied towards carbon neutrality commitments. Offsetnetwork.org is the hub for these projects within higher-ed and is expanding to pilot a Peer Verification structure that will validate and verify self-generated projects by having a peer institution act as the verifier. These credits qualify for Second Nature's Carbon Commitment and AASHE Stars 'Institution Catalyzed Offsets' in addition to qualifying as a Stars reporting 'Exemplary Practice Credit'. The Peer Verification process was piloted in the Spring of 2018 when American University acted as the project verifier for Duke University's urban forestry offset projects in North Carolina. Both American University and Duke will be presenting the findings from the verification report and the experience of working through the Peer Verification structure.",1336,123,2613,,,,,Air & Climate,Public Engagement,,,,,,carbon offsets,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Tani Colbert-Sangree,1336,"Program Coordinator, Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative",Ruby Woodside,123,Innovative Services Manager,Megan Litke,2613,Director of Sustainability Programs, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7996/1400_ColbertSangree_0412.pptx,,,
NE Drawdown: A Multi-College Effort to Adapt & Implement Impactful Regional Climate Change Solutions,"This past summer, students from Amherst, Smith, and Williams colleges investigated the global Drawdown methodology, compiled regional climate data to determine the top priorities for the area, and conducted a gap analysis to determine where the Northeast has overlap with global Drawdown and where regional strategies differ. They created a roadmap to determine where the drawdown approach aligns with or complements the work already being done in the region and how college campuses can use that research to most effectively address campus efforts. In this session, staff members from the various sustainability offices will discuss lessons learned, their next steps - both as a collaborative and on a campus-level - and how this model could be adapted for other regions. So what is 'Drawdown' itself? As the book and website state: 'The 100 most substantive solutions to reverse global warming, based on meticulous research by leading scientists and policymakers around the world.

Examining Data from Across Higher Ed: Does a Commitment Drive More Progress?,"In November 2017, the University of New Hampshire (UNH) launched the Sustainability Indicator Management and Analysis Platform (SIMAP™), a new inventory tool replacing the Campus Carbon Calculator and the CarbonMAP tools. Second Nature and UNH have a partnership that is focused on ensuring alignment between SIMAP and Second Nature's reporting platform for signatories of the Climate Leadership Commitments, and on jointly supporting users/signatories in accurately tracking and reporting their carbon and nitrogen footprints. The goal is to provide the following benefits: - Improved efficiency and ease for SIMAP users and Second Nature signatories - The potential to improve data quality for all users and for the sector as a whole - The ability to attract a large and sustained user base, which will in turn allow for a rich repository of campus energy and operational data than can be aggregated and analyzed to elucidate significant trends and opportunities for the sector With SIMAP storing greenhouse gas data from both signatories of the President's Climate Leadership Commitments and non-signatories, it provides an opportunity analyze progress across both groups. Previous data analysis released in 'The State of Sustainability in Higher Education' reports from UNH and Sightlines has provided some insights; this session will build on these insights by offering the first snapshot of aggregated SIMAP data analysis since the launch of the tool. It will also offer a case study of the challenging process of sharing data between tools and platforms aimed at a higher education sustainability audience; a process that many agree they would like to see happen more frequently, but that is often stymied by a host of barriers.",724,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,Public Engagement,,,,,"emissions reporting,climate commitments,SIMAP",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jennifer Andrews,724,Project Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Profitable Carbon Capture Technology for Campus Power Plants,"The University of Maryland is pursuing a partnership with technology firm, HY-TEK Bio, to install an algae based carbon capture system to mitigate emissions from UMD's combined heat and power plant. This project involves minimal CAPEX and OPEX for the university since HY-TEK Bio will build, own, and operate the carbon capture system in space leased from the university. HY-TEK Bio can divert flue emissions from a power plant and inject those emissions into closed photobioreactors where they grow a valuable strain of algae patented as HTB-1. Algae is harvested, dried, and sold to companies that process it into products for nutraceutical and food industries. Through profit-sharing with HY-TEK Bio, the university receives payments while sequestering GHG emissions.

Understanding the Entire Campus Carbon Footprint: How and Why to do Comprehensive Scope 3 Reporting,"Scope 3' emissions (i.e., those from upstream and downstream activities, such as producing the goods purchased by a campus, extracting and refining fuels, or commuting/business travel) are notoriously difficult to measure, and reduce. Scope 3 reporting requires a strategic approach, realistic expectations and a long-term outlook. It's also clear that there is an opportunity for the higher education sector to do this better. Traditionally, most Scope 3 emissions have been considered 'optional' categories for GHG reporting, and campuses have taken an ad hoc approach to what they do or do not include-with commuting and business travel being the most common. However, the handful of campuses that have attempted to do more comprehensive Scope 3 accounting have found that this can increase their reported impact by as much as 50%. SIMAP™, the UNH-supported, web-based carbon and nitrogen tool that is used by many colleges and universities, will soon feature a new module that facilitates comprehensive Scope 3 reporting. The module is being developed by working closely with pilot campuses, including the University of Texas Austin, that have already taken steps to better understand their complete institutional carbon footprints (including the impact of institutional purchasing.)

Beyond Offsetting: Onsetting Scope 3 Emissions and Supporting Innovative Local Projects,"Universities struggle to find meaningful ways to address their Scope 3 emissions, especially with regard to staff travel and study abroad. This session will explain carbon 'onsetting' as a positive alternative to carbon offsetting and how schools can use this system to support local, innovative projects within Second Nature's Climate and Resilience Commitments. While carbon offsetting can help students understand their emissions, it is an inefficient and non-transparent system with the implicit message that it is possible to 'buy a clean conscience while delaying meaningful action.' Carbon onsetting resolves these challenges by 1) pricing emissions based on the best scientific evidence of the Social Cost of Carbon; 2) dropping the controversial concept of carbon neutrality in order to broaden how we perceive and respond to climate change; and 3) moving beyond individual actions and focusing on systemic and collective change. Onsetting helps schools address their unavoidable emissions while focusing on what they do best -- educating the next generation of leaders for a better world.",7214,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Public Engagement,,,,,,"carbon offsets,scope 3 emissions",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Daniel Greenberg,7214,Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
GHG Accounting in Higher Education - The Case for Forging Our Own Path,"Quantifying Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission inventories and setting reduction goals started at the national level in the 1990's with the formation of UNFCCC and the first guidelines for inventory development by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1996 . Corporate entities followed suit, calling for their own standard for accounting and reporting GHG emissions in the late 90's . In 2006 twelve college and university presidents were 'motivated by their conviction that higher education had the capacity and responsibility to lead on climate and sustainability action for the sake of their students and society' to form the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment. Over the next eleven years, more than 600 institutes have joined to commit themselves to a goal of carbon neutrality. This time period saw the formation of many higher education sustainability offices and the development of many climate action plans. These numbers are impressive and our actions should be commended. However, by following in the footsteps of National and Corporate GHG accounting and not stepping back to consider our own drivers for action, we may have missed an opportunity to more fully engage the mission of our institutions into our GHG reduction strategies. We have an opportunity now - with many of us looking to expand our scope 3 categories, use or campuses as living labs, and better track and quantify the more 'unquantifiable' work our offices do.",2649,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"emissions reporting,climate commitments,emissions reduction",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Laura Draucker,2649,Director of Sustainability, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8523/0830_Draucker_0918.pptx,,,
"Do It Yourself Green Challenge - Cost Effective Way to Improve Health, Environment, & Climate Change","87% of all human produced CO2 emissions comes from burning fossil fuel for electricity/heat, transportation, and industry. The transportation sector is the second largest source of CO2 emission. The Green Challenge is a tool to create competition to combat climate change by reducing carbon emission using My Open Road FREE App to encourage participants to take sustainable transportation -- biking, walking, running, skating, carpooling, taking the bus, and driving electric or energy efficient cars and telework. The app uses GPS technology to record distances, speeds, and points of origin and destination of travel logged by users and CO2 saved. My Open Road rewards commuters for using eco-friendly transportation that produces low or zero carbon emissions and promotes a healthier lifestyle for participants. When displayed on their app's home screen, the number pounds of CO2 saved from being emitted into the atmosphere serves as measurable progress that participants find encouraging; It's a reminder of how important individual action is in improving the environment. In these challenges/competitions, participants compete to see who can save the most pounds of carbon dioxide by taking sustainable/active transportation.

Carbon Pricing on Campus: Four Models for Higher Ed Engagement on a Climate Solution,"To combat climate change, schools are using carbon pricing as a powerful tool for reducing campus emissions and advancing national policy solutions. Pricing has been used by both governments and corporations, but is nascent in the higher education sector. Following background and context about carbon pricing as a policy solution to climate change, we'll learn from panelists with experience advancing carbon pricing at their schools. Alex Barron, Breanna Parker and Dano Weisbord: Proxy pricing at Smith - We summarize tradeoffs and benefits of carbon fees and proxy prices, and how your institutional constraints may shape your choices, illustrated with case studies from Smith. Casey Pickett: Internal Carbon Charge at Yale - We describe how Yale charges its administrative units for building-related carbon emissions, how the charge was created, the challenges overcome in implementation, and the results from the first year of operation. Aurora Winslade and Nathan Graf: Campus engagement at Swarthmore - Swarthmore aims to use our Carbon Charge Program as a platform for community education and engagement about carbon pricing solutions.

"Achieving Large-Scale Campus Emissions Reductions: The Plan, Team, & Relationships Required","After President Trump announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accord, numerous Institutions indicated they would rise to the challenge by signing the 'We Are Still In' pledge. While this pledge has potential to create momentum and accountability at Universities to make real change, many are still struggling to put a dent in their campus emissions. In order to ensure the University of Dayton's signature was more than symbolic, UD's Hanley Sustainability Institute created a student led Campus Energy Team with a goal to reduce relative scope 1 and 2 emissions by 26% by 2025 - in line with the United States' original INDC to Paris. Our Campus Energy Team would like to share the most important takeaways from our first year in action, primarily the plan, team, and relationships required for significant progress. First, a graduate student will present on the process he took in identifying an achievable, quantitative goal and developing a clear plan to achieve that goal while including all relevant stakeholders in the process. Second, our students are excited to share the top cost-effective and innovative clean energy recommendations we have implemented, such as lighting and HVAC controls, in order for other institutions to replicate projects back at their campus. Lastly, a Facilities Management staff member will discuss the lessons learned from his unique experience in transitioning from a graduate student to a full-time Facilities Management staff member. In addition, he will discuss the importance of fostering strong relationships to ensure that the cost-effective clean energy projects recommendations are fully supported for implementation. Developing this effective and diverse team of undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and facilities management staff has been important in not only reducing emissions, but also serving as a hands on educational experience for students interested in a career in energy management.",2170,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Energy,,,,Facilities Management,,"emissions reduction,energy management",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Ryan Shea,2170,Graduate Research Assistant,Matthew Worsham,2170,Sustainability & Energy Coordinator,Andrea Mott,2170,Student,Sophia Palmer,2170,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8917/1430_Palmer_0189.pptx,,,
"Nailing Net Zero, From Design to Certification","More than 400 firms have signed onto the American Institute of Architects' (AIA) 2030 Commitment, targeting 70%+ EUI savings; however a 2016 AIA survey of participating firms revealed the portfolios of only six firms reached the 70% target. Why have so many fallen short, and how can schools better plan to meet net zero targets? The U.S. Department of Energy will deliver a primer of net zero energy buildings, including their technical definition, historical challenges, and trends. Community College of Allegheny County (CCAC) will discuss planning for their new, net zero energy 90,000-square-foot Workforce Development and Training Center, which will feature smart classrooms, laboratories, and multi-use spaces. They recently issued a request for qualifications (RFQ) that includes a number of specifications for constructing the center as a Net Zero Energy (NZE) facility, including a detailed breakdown of when and how energy modeling should take place. CCAC received 21 responses to the RFQ, all but one of which adhered to net zero energy. Learn how CCAC is carefully planning for this project to not just meet, but exceed its net zero energy goals.

Evolving Pennsylvania State University's Sustainability Policy Within a Regenerative Paradigm,"Penn State University (PSU) is a public research university serving Pennsylvania and the global community with a vision to integrate sustainability throughout its campuses and to prepare students to be sustainability leaders. At PSU the Office of Physical Plant (OPP) stewards approximately 32 million square feet of buildings providing facility services and safety programs in support of the university's threefold mission of teaching, research and services. OPP, in collaboration with PSU's Department of Architectural Engineering, has realized the potential of influencing and evolving the sustainability culture among students at PSU by shifting OPP's sustainability thinking from the paradigm of looking at buildings as a product into a more regenerative dynamic approach that recognizes buildings as systems. By encouraging and initiating reciprocity and mutually beneficial interaction among stakeholders throughout the different stages of the lifecycle of the building, OPP hopes to develop more sustainable campuses. OPP and the AE department are aiming to lead the transformation of the built environment at PSU while providing engaged scholarship opportunities for the students. As a first step towards this vision an AE graduate student, sponsored by OPP, is working to evolve PSU's LEED Policy to reflect a dynamic based process that encourages the engagement of OPP teams in the earliest stages of a project.",4190,,,,,,,Buildings,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,Facilities Management,,"policies,building systems",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Yumna Kurdi,4190,PhD Candidate,John Bechtel,4190,"Assistant Director, Design and Construction Division",David Riley,4190,Professor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8177/0830_Kurdi_0588.pdf,,,

"Biophilic Design Principles and Green Infrastructure: Forging New Possibilities for Nature, Harmony and Resiliency in Urban Environments ","Green Infrastructure practices are being mandated and implemented in urban communities for multiple beneficial outcomes. Often referred to as grey infrastructure alternatives, these practices include the design, installation, and maintenance of on-structure vegetation, bioswales, urban forests, green streets and pervious pavements. All of these practices serve to emulate nature and provide the same benefits: rainwater absorption and disbursement, cooler air, carbon sequestration and lowered water management infrastructure costs. There is a more desirable benefit to consider when contemplating the design implications of these urban stormwater management projects. That benefit is the 'biophilic effect.' This psychological phenomenon was first described by E.O. Wilson in his thesis, 'Biophilia.' Simply stated, humans cannot develop as well-formed individuals in the absence of nature. In the late 80's architect, Stephen Kellert, recognized Wilson's work as a solution he had long been seeking. Together, they authored 'The Biophilia Hypothesis' and Kellert continued to pioneer the research through 'Biophilic Design' (2008). This presentation, which includes a 'flash' charette, will inform and apply the essential prinicples of biophilic design to modern green infrastructure projects in the campus and urban environment.",8630,8624,,,,,,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"biophilia,green infrastructure",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Joanne Rodriguez,8630,Owner,Mary Ann Uhlmann,8624,"Urban Horticulture Consulting, LLC", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
US Department of Energy Funding to Simplify Sustainable Campus Design,"Campuses that use fewer natural resources and buoy health, learning and happiness are increasingly vital for educational institutions, as students and faculty voice demand for it. To deliver a sustainable building, institutional leaders must get consensus among siloed stakeholders PRIOR to engaging a design / construction team. If this large task is under-resourced, well intentioned building projects underachieve. To address, the University of Chicago partnered w/ sustainability firm Seventhwave, to improve the University's internal pre-project process when a new building or major renovation is contemplated. Partnership goals were to define clear pre-project process that: - Facilitates internal goal and stakeholders consensus; - Clarifies process / structure to reduce risk and budget uncertainty; - Enables high-performance beautiful design to meet demanding expectations; - Drives competition for bidding project teams to deliver deeper sustainability for same budget / schedule As UChicago buildings, such as Campus North Residential Commons, provided evidence this process delivered results, the US Department of Energy funded Seventhwave to create the Accelerate Performance (AP) program, to scale innovation nationally thru utility partnerships, financial incentives and consulting services to institutions: - Rebates for energy use reduction; - No-cost advising, facilitation, Request for Proposal writing, energy models, cost-benefit analysis for new building development.",8223,7517,,,,,,Buildings,Coordination & Planning,Energy,,,,,"funding,building design,construction",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Mike Stopka,8223,University Sustainability Advisor,Connor Work/school street Jansen,7517,Practice Lead, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

Computer Networks Doing Their Part to be Sustainable - New Industry Standards,"College and University planners are challenged by the exploding demand for data services, as more and more devices are added to campuses. Administrators and students are asking whether this trend is sustainable, and how it can be responsibly embraced. As very few people understand the behind-the-scenes infrastructure, there is little visibility or awareness of the great impact this trend has. Besides the obvious expansion of bandwidth demand from social media, streaming video, and Wi-Fi phone calls, there are many new devices and applications being added to the mix. Wearable technologies such as smart watches and biometric-enabled clothing and footwear, wireless group collaboration technologies, and GPS-enabled social media run silently in the background of the fabric of the campus. Networks are integral to all academics and campus life, and as a utility are a foundational tool to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. How can higher education professionals adopt new ideas from the ICT (Information Communications Technology) industry, and adopt responsible technology sustainability plans that are not 'greenwash?' To this end, the ICT Industry, through professional associations, have been developing Standards in the area of technology sustainability for several years now. New and emerging standards build on existing guidelines such as LEED, and include standards for data centers, networks, audiovisual systems, and smart buildings. These standards are from reputable industry trade associations such as TIA, BICSI, AVIXA, etc., and carry designations such as ANSI and ISO. This session will introduce how Higher Education planners can specify these standards when developing new and renovated building plans. Continuing operations and occupant engagement standards will also be explored.

Evolving Building Sustainability: United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Framework Principles,"Buildings consume 40% of energy globally. As buildings are continuously enhanced to be more sustainable and healthy, a number of strategies have been employed to achieve energy reduction targets. This proposal provides insight into a program developed to engage a globally diverse cohort of next generation professionals in collaborative, immersive, experiential learning dedicated to the advancement of sustainability in the built environment. The program was conducted in a way that builds the capability of participants as agents of evolution with the confidence and direction to make tangible contributions. The goal was to align and expand a community of practitioners while using the built environment as a nodal intervention to develop the capacity of ecological, social, and economic systems that grow the vitality of each place indefinitely. The program involved a cohort of 17 participants from 11 different countries who convened for 6 weeks from July to mid-August 2017. Other elements included research to reveal the unique challenges shared by global communities, hands-on experience with technological interventions and place-based solutions, a critical review of existing policies, and recommendations to enhance sustainability in buildings. The UNECE principles served as an instrument to test place-based solutions. Ireland was selected a case study due to its demonstrated leadership in sustainability for buildings through passive house standards. The program culminated in a meeting with representatives from the UN, Ireland, and other stakeholders in the built environment. Reflection questions, group discussions, and interactive sessions with faculty and industry professionals were used as tools to facilitate participation. Continuous engagement is maintained with the cohort though periodic web-conferences to share ideas and discuss progress on related projects.

"Transforming Existing, Iconic, Landmark Buildings Into Modern, High-Performance Buildings","The challenge most universities face today is modernizing building performance (high indoor environmental quality and low energy consumption) cost effectively, while preserving the image of iconic structures dedicated to learning. Rockwell Hall, built in 1957, is a steel-framed building with light-colored stone exterior--similar to what you might see on most college campuses. Dr. Robert Sroufe and Craig Stevenson developed a novel approach to transforming old buildings into high-performance buildings using technology. By combining IES VE whole-building performance modeling, a sustainability master plan and an integrated dashboard, owners can simulate building performance and create an investment plan that reduces risk and maximizes return of a portfolio of buildings. Rockwell Hall shows how early planning and modest investment makes otherwise impossible sustainability goals achievable for any institution. The demonstrations of Passive House EnerPhit for existing buildings, along with RESET standardization for indoor air quality strategies provide a foundation for learning best practices. Various techniques from LEED, Living Building Challenge, The 2030 Challenge and WELL Building Institute add insight and context. For buildings like Rockwell Hall, the most economical and scalable strategies come from utilizing a myriad of attributes from these proven standards.

State of Sustainability in Higher Education: Charting a Course for Continued Success,"Facilities leaders have invested a great deal of effort and financial resources towards pursuing the ideals enumerated in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and 13 (Climate Change). In the third annual State of Sustainability Report from Sightlines and University of New Hampshire Sustainability Institute, we highlight sector-wide successes, including improved energy efficiency (at the campus-level) and widespread switching to lower-emissions fuels. We also emphasize some troubling trends related to campus space growth and increased complexity of systems in new construction & renovations. We will begin this presentation with an overview of these sector-wide findings, then shift the focus to a Texas A&M University (TAMU) case study. TAMU has managed to stabilize energy consumption despite significant campus growth. The University has, for many years, reaped the financial rewards of investing in campus infrastructure overhauls and mechanical upgrades. More recently, TAMU began a targeted, engagement-focused project called the Energy Performance Improvement Program (EPI). The goal: to generate energy savings, to mitigate the environmental impacts of complex, new-construction buildings, and to work to generate building occupant enthusiasm. Through EPI, TAMU avoided $450k in annual costs across just 6 buildings.

Making Positive Impacts With Zero Energy Buildings,"Zero Energy buildings generate all the energy that they need onsite from renewable sources. Getting there requires significant energy efficiency, onsite renewable energy generation, ongoing occupant engagement, and performance-based energy management. It's also no guarantee. According to a recent New Buildings Institute report, there are currently 67 buildings in North America that have achieved zero energy certification, while an additional 415 buildings are pursuing the certification. This presentation will include discussion and insights from architects and owners of two zero energy buildings-California State University, Northridge's LEED Platinum Sustainability Center and Millersville University's Lombardo Welcome Center-considering everything from design and construction to occupant and student engagement to ongoing performance management.

Phase Change Materials,"The phase change material is an easy solution to temperature fluctuations from the weather outside. These materials are a new way to insulate a building. The materials go into the ceiling or wall, trap the heat by turning into a gaseous state, then at night the heat is released and the materials turn into a solid again. The need to use electricity to heat and cool the building is reduced. Northern Arizona University won the Arizona Forwards Innovator Award for their use of the phase change materials. These materials allow buildings to be retrofitted for a low cost.",567,,,,,,,Buildings,,,,,,,"retrofits,building materials",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Chandler McCormick,567,Undergraduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
The Fossil Fuel Divestment Movement and Student Activism at Syracuse University and SUNY-ESF,"On April 1, 2015, Syracuse University announced that it would divest its $1.18 billion endowment from fossil fuels. Shortly thereafter, its partner institution, SUNY-ESF, made the same commitment. These moves were immediately praised in global media outlets, with major stories featured prominently in The New York Times and The Guardian (UK). A year later, Syracuse University announced that its fossil-fuel-free endowment was actually exceeding performance expectations. On the surface, this policy move appears to be a rare 'win-win.' Beneath the surface, however, lies a more complex story. Although university administration announced fossil-fuel divestment to the press as a policy decision, it was in fact the result of a sustained three-year campaign of student activism, culminating in an 18-day occupation of Syracuse University's administration building. Analysis of this story, not told in press releases and news outlets, provides us with a richer account of student and administrative environmental decision-making. This presentation is an analysis of in-depth interviews with key actors surrounding the fossil-fuel divestment movement at Syracuse University and SUNY-ESF-students, faculty, staff, and administrators. In this session, we will explain how the fossil-fuel divestment and climate activism movement emerged in this case, analyze its successes and failures from the perspectives of diverse stakeholders, & examine key takeaways with participants.",2335,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Air & Climate,Investment & Finance,,,,,"divestment,activism,students",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Adam Fix,2335,Lecturer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Breaking Down 'Drawdown' - Explaining Global Sustainability Solutions at the Community Level,"There's a new framework for climate action in town - Project Drawdown is self-described as a comprehensive efforts to 'identify, research, and model the 100 most substantive, existing solutions to address climate change.' The Drawdown project team asked what we could achieve if we scaled up existing tools already at hand. They found that by putting the top 100 solutions into practice worldwide, we DO have the power to reverse global warming. Keeping morale high when talking to the average person about climate change is no easy task. Even once people come to terms with the fact that climate change is real and requires urgent action, many still have little confidence in the role, if any, they or their communities can play in reversing global warming. To help connect global solutions to a personal level, the University of Virginia is hosting an event during Earth Week 2018 that brings together UVA leaders doing work around the top 100 Drawdown solutions. These local climate warriors will share with attendees the many ways we are already prepared to reverse climate change, here and now! The really unique thing about the Drawdown framework is that some of the top solutions are quite different than one might expect. Expanding our idea of climate solutions beyond just large-scale renewable energy, allows people working on educating girls (the #6 solution), family planning (#7), reducing food waste (#3), and more to see themselves as change agents for a more resilient planet.",4028,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Air & Climate,Public Engagement,,,,,"drawdown,solutions focus,emissions reduction",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Dana Schroeder,4028,Sustainability Outreach & Engagement Specialist,Nina Morris,4028,Outreach & Engagement Program Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8417/1400_Schroeder_0807.pdf,,,

Sustainability in Corl Street Elementary School,"Corl Street Elementary is undergoing a renovation to meet the gold standard LEED Certification. The certification is more likely to be awarded if the school building serves as a teaching tool to communicate ecological, economic, and social aspects of sustainability. We set out to identify which features of the building can fulfill this teaching obligation and how students might encounter the learning opportunities inside and outside the classroom in a non invasive way. We researched Sustainability Theory through the works of David Orr and Wendell Berry, and successful case studies promoted by the Center of Ecological Literacy. We interviewed stakeholders, from parents, to school board members, to administrators, to teachers, in order to understand the curriculum standards and expectations.

How Knowledge Can Create a Culture of Sustainability,"In the United States, buildings account for nearly 70 percent of electricity consumption. According to the EPA, up to 30 percent of electricity is inefficiently or unnecessarily used. In light of SDGs 11 and 13 this should be considered a great opportunity. Buildings contain a massive amount of data which can be critical to supporting energy efficiency and other sustainability goals. Unfortunately, this data is difficult to access because building technologies are typically complex, siloed and available to a small number of users. Expanding access to this data can have far-reaching benefits to spreading critical knowledge to stakeholders across an organization from sustainability and facilities staff to students, faculty and more.

Selling Sustainability: 5 Principles of Persuasion,"In today's political and social climate, an understanding of the science of persuasion is the most important tool for any environmentalist. Led by two Texas-based sustainability consultants and green building advocates, this presentation will cover five principals of persuasion that merge classical theories of rhetoric with the latest findings in social psychology and neuroscience. Concepts will be explained through hand-drawn illustrations and discussions of success stories and failures drawn from the history of the environmental movement and from presenters' careers as green building advocates in a region that is traditionally hostile towards environmental causes (Texas). The presenters will also introduce attendees to the Reddit forum 'Change My View,' a structured online opportunity to post a view and have it constructively challenged by other users. Finally, based on the methodology of the forum, attendees will practice changing minds in a fun interactive exercise. This presentation is unique in it's delivery - we speak over our own hand-drawn animations of five persuasion principles. Our exercise at the end is also uniquely engaging.

Beyond the Ball: Sustainability Success in Nontraditional Athletics,"By leveraging sports like synchronized swimming (The Ohio State University), diving (IUPUI), or engaging K-12 students through on-campus sports sustainability games (University of Colorado/University of Louisiana), campuses are able to engage athletes, fans, and the broader community in their pursuit of successful sustainability programs and influence behavioral change among fans at home, work, and play. These programs not only reduce the environmental impact on campus, but also educate the local communities about making more environmentally conscious choices. Implementing sustainability through sports allows campuses to develop a strong platform for sustainability, and impact is broadened when the programs are used to educate fans and communities about contributing to sustainable places where we all live, work, and play. Additionally, SDG's (such as: Good health and well being, sustainable cities and communities, Partnerships for the goals, Responsible consumption and production) can all be exemplified in these programs, and can provide a framework of inspiration and duplication across campuses around the world.",1353,2335,1617,2130,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,,"athletics,behavior change,fan engagement",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Jessica Davis,1353,"Director, IUPUI Office of Sustainability",Graham Oberly,2335,Sustainability Coordinator--Department of Athletics,Monica Rowand,1617,Sustainability Coordinator,Dave Newport,2130,"Director, Environmental Center", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8230/0915_Oberly_0623.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10154/0915_Rowand_0623.pdf,,

Implementing a Sustainable Living Program on Campus: Encouraging Students to Walk the Talk,"The Lehigh University Eco-Rep Leadership Program has successfully designed and implemented a Sustainable Living Program where Eco-Reps work with their peers in residential halls and Greek houses to make their living spaces more sustainable. This is a voluntary, self-guided certification process that includes specific questions that address day-to-day living habits in various categories including energy, water, purchasing, recycling, food/dining, and involvement. By taking action in a variety of topic areas, students take the lead to reduce their environmental impact, are responsible stewards of the university's resources, and contribute to Lehigh's sustainability goals and commitments. But how do you get started with a certification program like this? What is the path to designing a successful program? In this session, we will discuss Lehigh University's path to developing a Sustainable Living Program from determining program coordination, the application process, the checklist of actions, the different certification levels and incentives, and program logistics. We will also discuss key lessons learned, best practices, and next steps for expanding the program.

"Transformative Change, the SDGs, and the Future of Sustainability in Higher Education","This session uses a panel discussion format to explore transformative change, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the future of sustainability in higher education by drawing on the wisdom and insights of a noted panel of campus sustainability thought leaders and practitioners The session builds on a panel organized by Meghan Fay Zahniser for the 2016 AASHE Conference to focus on recent, high-level calls for transformative change in HE-and in particular those by the UN and UNESCO in relation to the UN SDGs (to prepare graduates to play meaningful roles in creating well-being focused societies)-while also addressing barriers and challenges and articulating ways to tunnel through these barriers (both in theory and practice). It will focus on both progress during the past two decades and the significant organizational, curricular, pedagogical, and modeling gaps that currently limit the reach and impact of HE to contribute toward creating well-being societies and meeting the aspirations set forth in the UN SDGs. A special issue of Sustainability: the Journal of Record will be produced that reflects the panel commentary, while more fully developing the ideas and challenges discussed by the panelists and audience. Panelists will be given 1 - 2 key questions in advance to stimulate the conversation.

Incorporating Environmental Justice Into Peer Mentor Programs,"Many of us have been grappling with the question of how to intentionally incorporate environmental justice into higher education sustainability work. This session will identify key areas where a holistic vision of sustainability, one where sustainability is understood to be the intersection of human health, social equity, protecting ecology, and economic vitality, can be applied to peer mentor education programs. Through my work as the Coordinator of Western Washington University's Sustainability Representative Program, I have found that peer mentor programs often tend to focus on the ecological aspects of sustainability. Western Washington University's peer mentor program has been evolving over the past few years to better reflect this intersectional vision of sustainability that we strive towards. Using Western's Sustainability Representative Program as a case study, attendees will understand how to apply concepts into peer mentor programs to foster a more inclusive and justice based program. At the end of the session, attendees will have a deeper understanding of environmental justice and be able to identify areas in their own programs where ideas of environmental justice can be incorporated.",1876,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,Curriculum,,,,,"environmental justice,peer-to-peer,mentorship",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Madeleine Jones,1876,Undergraduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Environmental Justice Grant Funding: Piloting Equity Efforts in Campus Green Funds,"The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) at UC Berkeley has a 10-year history of funding environmental sustainability projects for its campus community; however, the program has not specifically prioritized environmental justice (EJ) components to environmentalism until more recently. In an effort to address equity and inclusion, TGIF Staff and its governing Committee chose to pilot an environmental justice thematic grant cycle in the Spring 2018 semester. Modeled after the EPA's Environmental Justice Small Grants Program, TGIF's thematic grant cycle required forming a Planning Committee of students and a variety of collaborative discussions in order to define EJ, the thematic grant cycle's purpose statement, and eligibility for student organizations and departments on a college campus. In this session, UC Berkeley will share its lessons learned and best practices around hosting a thematic EJ grant cycle via a reductive model in the hopes of inspiring other college campuses to begin critically thinking about and applying environmental justice throughout their offered environmental programs and services. As part of UC Berkeley's Student Environmental Resource Center (SERC), TGIF has begun operationalizing tenets of EJ into its grant cycle through a multi-phase & multi-tiered grant review process that privileges historically underrepresented groups. This falls in line with a Strategic Organizational Goal (SOG) of SERC focused on thinking about and implementing equity and inclusion.",4473,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,"green funds,environmental justice,funding,equity",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Brian Gialketsis,4473,The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) Coordinator,Madeline Tucker,4473,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7912/1045_Gialketsis_0330.pptx,,,

Visual Storytelling for Sustainability: Raising Your Game in Photo and Video,"Do you struggle to take photos that look 'professional' rather than run-of-the-mill? Is the idea of making a video, or even the occasional Boomerang clip, intimidating? In short, are quality visual stories lacking from your sustainability communications? Visual storytelling has redefined the world of communications in recent years. New content sharing platforms, advances in cell phone and digital camera technology, and the broader cultural shift toward digital media means that quality photography and videography are crucial tools. While the majority of us are comfortable with the basic functions on our phones and digital cameras, it's not uncommon for sustainability programs to hire professionals for the occasional visual storytelling and documentation projects that 'really matter.' Given varying budgets and staffing, however, this solution is not always feasible. Moreover, inconsistencies in visual content are immediately apparent to our increasingly sophisticated and discerning audiences. In this session, we will seek to empower participants to achieve better overall quality in their visual content. We'll discuss concrete ways in which non-professionals can improve their photography and videography skills, as well as offer activities in which attendees can practice in small groups.

Graphic Design Strategies for Sustainability,"Graphic designers can create positive change by integrating sustainability into their work. Graphic design is often not a sustainable practice, even so, sustainable design guidelines can reduce its impact. Energy, water, paper, inks, solvents and packaging are used, but designing for originality rather than size, using optimum print jobs, avoiding full-bleed prints, picking chlorine free paper, buying from environmentally friendly paper suppliers, buying VOC-free printing ink, prototyping, and making clients aware of sustainable design guidelines are all methods that support sustainable design. In my presentation, I will outline how sustainability relates to design and how offices in higher education can make decisions with sustainability in mind. As a designer, I must consider the audience of the design. At the WMU Office for Sustainability, we make graphics that relate complex ideas in a clear, pictorial fashion. For example, we have created a graphic relating to Learning for Sustainability Core Competencies; this is conceptual, but it delivers the information in a clear and concise manner. Our process of graphic design employs high levels of active social learning, group brainstorming, sketching of concepts, creating prototypes, and open critiques until we arrive at a rich and compelling graphic. I will show examples of our most recent designs, how we arrived at the final product, and stories about what we learned along the way.",1817,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,Public Engagement,Design,,,,"communications,design",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Rebecca Schaefer,1817,Graphic Designer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7867/0830_Schaefer_0285.pdf,,,
Sustainability Week: A Case Study in Diversity of Programing to Maximize Outreach Across Barriers,"The College of Charleston's Office of Sustainability has had several flagship programs and series over the years, but none near the scale and dynamism of the annual Sustainability Week. The goal of this Networking Meeting is to use Sustainability Week, and the planning and programming that accompanies it, as a case study in maximizing outreach and engagement throughout the campus community, taking into account the narrow public perception towards sustainability and the barriers incumbent in achieving campus-wide appeal among the myriad often insular and competing interests at a liberal arts university. The Office instituted Sustainability Week its first academic year in existence, Spring 2012, and over the ensuing years has benefited from consistent evolutions and explorations into various formats, target groups, and scopes for its events. This networking meeting will draw from, reflect upon, and compare upwards of one hundred unique events over seven years, ranging from keynotes from notable academics such as Vandana Shiva to student-implemented workshops. Utilizing visual aids and handouts to supplement discussion, we aim to engage participants in a thorough conversation about the pros and cons of various formats, logistics, impediments, etc. that go into planning and implementing major multi-day events such as Sustainability Week. This will facilitate sharing perspectives from participants and provide recommendations to be to taken back to home institutions. While actively soliciting questions and additional perspectives, we will delve into issues such as the spacing of events throughout the day and week, budgeting, how to build campus and interdepartmental/interoffice coalitions and collaborations, how to entice the 'uninitiated' on campus, navigating potential campus conflicts and politics when approaching sensitive or controversial topics, and challenge previously held conceptions of sustainability to expand understanding among the general population.",5047,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,,events,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Adrian Barry,5047,Office Manager,Ashley Lynn Lavender,5047,Student Programs Coordinator and Faculty, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Learning From the Past to Inform the Future: Leveraging Campus-Community Partnerships With Dialogue,"Achieving complex sustainable development goals that integrate human and natural systems, including health and wellbeing as well as sustainable cities and communities, requires open and transparent collaboration with stakeholders. At Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania, a World Café was utilized to bolster stakeholder partnerships and collaboratively re-envision the mission of the Robert A. Macoskey Center for Sustainable Systems Education and Research. The World Café is a creative dialogic process that facilitates a platform for everyone's voice to be heard. This approach provided a unique and innovative way for us to engage a broad diversity of stakeholders from Slippery Rock University and the surrounding community during a time of leadership transition at the Robert A. Macoskey Center. Collaborative input from students, faculty, staff, and community members allowed our leadership team to both learn from the past and focus future directions on shared goals. Results, such as the need to transition from planning to action and the need to expand interdisciplinary educational and employment opportunities at Slippery Rock University, are being used to guide the direction of research, outreach, and educational programming. In this workshop, we will share best practices, lessons learned, and next steps from our World Café experience. These have helped to better align our teaching and research activities at Slippery Rock University around the sustainable development goals. In addition, we will engage participants in a World Café simulation so that they will learn how to facilitate their own World Café session to gather information that leverages sustainable development goals on their campuses and in their communities.",4704,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,,"stakeholder engagement,community engagement,world cafe",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Samantha Laurence,4704,Graduate Student,Jacob Smith,4704,Graduate Student,Shawn Davis,4704,Assistant Professor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9230/1430_Laurence_0569.pptx,,,
Undergrads as Consultants: Sharing Strategies and Experiences From a Student Intern Program,"The UW-Madison Office of Sustainability (OS) employs student interns year-round to work on campus sustainability projects. The model for their efforts is one of consultation; the students serve as a resource for other entities on campus. By adopting this model, we are able to tailor our programs and projects to address the specific needs or goals of each client. Historically, the office has been comprised of two teams: the Waste and Recycling team, and the Green Office team. Both teams have targeted sustainability goals through direct engagement with various campus partners. The Waste and Recycling team has worked with dining and residence halls in an effort to reduce the amount of material sent to landfill by cleaning up waste streams. Meanwhile, through our Green Office Certification Program, the Green Office team gives UW-Madison employees the information and tools they need to learn about sustainability, better understand the impacts of their practices, and create healthy and sustainable work environments. These programs have been very successful and as a result, the OS is now expanding our efforts to other parts of campus.

Local branches of national organizations such as Surfrider, Lonely Whale, and 5 Gyres paired with The Greater Charleston Restaurant Association, Charleston Bartenders Guild, and Plastic-free Lowcountry to take a stand against single-use plastic by creating a campaign during which Charleston restaurants pledge to only give out straws upon request. The Strawless Summer campaign runs annually Memorial Day through Labor Day and aims to decrease plastic pollution. The College of Charleston (CofC) has pledged to be zero waste by 2030. Part of going zero waste means removing non-reusable items from campus, including plastic straws, bags, and food packaging. The biggest contaminants around campus are coffee cups, lids, and straws. According to September 2017 sales data at CofC's Starbucks, 1200 straws were distributed per week; meaning these 1200 straws could end up harming wildlife and humans due to environmental pollution. Modeled after the Strawless Summer Campaign, Strawless Week 2018 was spearheaded by CofC's Office of Sustainability in partnership with Healthy Human, Alliance for Planet Earth, GoPure Pod, Aramark, CofC's Dining Services, and CofC's SGA. During the campaign, reusable straws, water bottles, coffee cups, and other free items were distributed to Starbucks visitors in addition to information about plastic pollution. During this event, Starbucks offered their 'sippy lids' for their cold beverages instead of the classic lid and straw. The purpose of this event was to raise awareness about the pervasive single-use plastic issue on CofC's campus and in the greater Charleston community. After the event, the number of plastic and reusable straws used were quantified and compared to historical data based on September Starbucks' sales report to see how many plastic straws were 'saved'.",5047,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Waste,,,,,,"Single-use plastic,straws",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Neyle Steadman,5047,"Student, Office of Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Campus Controversies: How Should Sustainability Offices Respond?,"Election results, sexual misconduct allegations, racist graffiti, controversial op-eds, poorly worded emails are resulting in cycles of anger, backlash, emotional release, exhaustion and division on many of our campuses. At Dartmouth, for example, a January 2018 op-ed published by a male student, speculating that his rejection from a leadership position was due to his gender, set off a cycle like this on our campus. As an office focused on training student leaders, equipping them with the skills to effect organizational change, and educating them about how sustainability is intersectional with justice issues, and with student interns involved on both sides, we felt obligated to respond. These moments are important learning opportunities for students. In the case at Dartmouth, we had an opportunity to explore issues such as how and when identity should be part of a hiring process, the role of media in cultural discussion, conversation across radical difference, empathy and what it means to 'be in solidarity' not just in words, but in actions. Each cycle of campus conflict provides moments that can foster discussion, learning and skills building. They also can be exhausting, overwhelming and disempowering. In this session, we will collectively explore the role of Sustainability Offices in these cycles and talk about whether, when and how our offices engage.",788,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,Diversity & Affordability,,,Sustainability Office,,"equity,communications,discrimination response",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Jenna Musco,788,Assistant Director,Rosi Kerr,788,Sustainability Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Green in a Red State: Working Towards Sustainable Development Goals in a Conservative Environment,"The era of Trump may have officially begun on in 2017, but Trump era ideas on issues of sustainability, inclusion & equity have existed in parts of the country for some time. Citizens, political & academic leaders in red states have held similar views of climate change & the UN Sustainable Development Goals since their inception. As sustainability staff, faculty & students in these places, how do we move forward with the work that needs to get done in these climates while avoiding the pitfalls of burnout & discouragement? In many ways, ultra-conservative environments have become one front line for sustainability work, as the necessity for change & innovation becomes more important, & the risks of falling behind nationally & globally are ever increasing. This session will focus on the experience of the presenters and attendees in order to create a blueprint for working on sustainability issues in red states and cities. The presenters will engage with participants through group work in order to create an outline for developing coalitions, recruiting students, staff & faculty, shifting culture & engaging with decision makers who may be hesitant to support the cause due to personal conviction or political ramifications. The goals of the discussion are twofold: to problem solve & exchange ideas, and to create a group of individuals who are working in these 'front line' states. This group will meet virtually regularly post-conference to create a community of sustainability-minded individuals.",2052,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),politics,conservative movement",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Eric Hemphill,2052,Asst Dir.

Wrestling With the Invisibility Cloak: Catalyzing Student Action and Creating Office Recognition,"As sustainability officer's we often lead from behind, supporting students as a silent or invisible partner. This enables them to bring awareness to issues and take ownership over the changes they seek. In fact, one could argue that without this approach we reduce the impact and educational benefit of our work. However, this approach also means much of our work goes unnoticed to the general campus community, making it difficult to sustain change and build the recognition needed to obtain higher-level support within our institutions. Many of us struggle with the right approach to ensure both of these goals are met: empowering and educating students (and sometimes other staff and faculty) to take action, and recognition of (and equivalent resource allocation to) the Sustainability Office. Furthermore, when much of our success is tied to quantitative reductions in energy use or greenhouse gas emissions, it can be challenging to express the benefit on the qualitative work we do. This session will be a chance to have an open and frank discussion about this problem, with a goal of collecting both best practices and common challenges that we can share with each other after the session. Some schools have identified ways to strike this balance, while others have examples of projects that didn't succeed in meeting both goals.",2649,2246,2985,4705,1718,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,Sustainability Office,,"sustainability officers,students,recognition",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Laura Draucker,2649,Director of Sustainability,Lisa Tornatore,2246,Assistant Director for Sustainability,Chelsea Malacara,2985,Sustainability Education and Outreach Coordinator,Emma Kerr,4705,Sustainability and Communications Administrator,Liesel Schwarz,1718,Sustainability Staff, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Acts of Art for the Environment,"In Sustainable Earth, there are two different project groups, one focusing on the intersection of environmentalism and technology, the other on environmental art. My poster will focus on how art can be utilized on college campuses to promote environmental issues, and the challenges that one might face when embarking on similar projects. The history of college students and activism is long, and has brought about great change. The purpose of this poster presentation is to help inspire other students that may be artistically-inclined environmentalist or environmentally-conscious artists. Specifically, the poster will discuss Sustainable Earth's most recent art project, 'What's Your Plastic Footprint?' as a model for how activism art works on campus outside of the art school and its resources.",2849,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,,arts & culture,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Chandler Sabourin,2849,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9492/1430_Sabourin_0863.pptx,,,
"Partnering With Purpose: Curating Sustainability Leadership With Staff, Students, and Faculty","During the 2017 academic year, the Office of Sustainability at our university partnered with two AmeriCorps volunteers to create the Student Sustainability Leadership Program and the Employee Sustainability Ambassadors Program. The creation of these programs was inspired by a desire for greater campus collaboration around sustainability. Through eight, two-hour sessions focused upon regional characteristics, participants in each program were able to identify and discuss sustainability issues encountered in their departments, offices, classes, and even residence halls. The primary purpose of these two programs was not to create new projects or campaigns, but rather to foster a unified understanding and engagement around sustainability. These programs expanded upon our commitment to sustainable action and increased campus engagement in the activities of the Office of Sustainability, growing our ability to foster change. These programs were unique in creating platforms for sustainability literacy and discussion for all members of campus, helping any member of campus become a change agent for sustainability. Attendees in this session will learn about how to approach the development of such programs, consider key takeaways gained within the first year, and discuss how the UN Sustainable Development goals can be applied to further the programs' impacts on campus and in the community.",2258,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"student leadership,on-campus collaboration",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Alex Thomas,2258,Higher Education Waste Reduction Specialist,Jim Simon,2258,Director of Sustainability,Carrie Herrman,2258,Americorps Volunteer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10489/0915_Thomas_0270.pdf,,,
Facilitation for Organizational Change ,"One of the most important, yet often under-appreciated, skill sets of any profession is the ability to be a strong group meeting facilitator. Whether it is a small staff meeting or a campus-wide strategic planning effort, being a confident and effective facilitator is essential. So, what does it mean to be a strong facilitator? What are concrete tools one can use to lead a group decision-making process? Part I will include facilitation refresher activities designed to guide participants through the important steps in group facilitation. The group will be able to test their knowledge of important tools that can help groups generate new ideas as well as help them converge those ideas into actionable next steps. Through fun and interactive activities, participants will be challenged to apply the tools they learn with these engaging, hands-on experiences. In Part II, participants will have ample time to practice facilitate meetings using tried and proven techniques and to receive constructive feedback from the group in a safe environment. There will also be time for group discussion where collectively the group will share new ideas as well as help converge those ideas into actionable next steps.

"Fostering Sustainability Culture on an Irish Campus, Lessons Learned from UCC's Green Campus Journey","This session will tell the story of University College Cork's experience in embedding sustainability on campus over the last decade. This journey has taken UCC from a student-led campaign to become a 'Green Flag' campus in 2007, to the university signing up to the STARS programme in 2018. UCC was the pilot university for the 'Green Flag' programme, which is now being run in 14 countries worldwide by the Foundation for Environmental Education. This programme is operationally focused, taking the university through an environmental management system across themes corresponding to the most significant environmental aspects. Following the publication of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, the university recognised the need to take a broader approach, and in 2016 UCC's Sustainability Strategy was published broadening the focus to areas such as engaged citizenship and health and wellbeing. In 2017, a Sustainability Officer was appointed (one of only two such positions across the entire higher education sector in Ireland). In 2018, the University commences its first STARS submission. The bottom-up approach of the Green Campus campaign, combined with high-level commitment, has resulted in a culture change throughout the university. This session will outline the differences in 'landscape' between the US and Ireland, and how institutions in both regions might learn from one another. We will describe what was learned in implementing the Green Campus programme in UCC.",7026,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,culture of sustainability,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Pat Mehigan,7026,Sustainability Staff,Mark Poland,7026,Director of Buildings and Estates, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8141/0830_Mehigan_0539.pdf,,,

GreenTech LIU: A Digital Platform for Campus SDG Collaboration,"Sustainability and education for global citizenship are essential literacies for the 21st century. LIU Post's Center for Sustainability wants faculty and students to have powerful and effective digital tools for strengthening these literacies in classroom learning and research experiences. GreenTech LIU (GTLIU) will provide an integrated digital platform for faculty and students to collaborate on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with an emphasis on local and global citizenship projects. Education for global citizenship serves as a center axis that can help to integrate sustainability activities across university campuses. While many SDG projects will be grounded in local experiences and applications, it is important for universities to explore the cross-cultural and international dimensions of the SDGs. GTLIU will provide a campus hub for faculty and student social media engagement. GTLIU will allow students to track their ecological footprints; explore digital apps; and post videos, photos, and blogs. Digital platforms provide new interactive tools for student learning, research, assessment, and advancement of SDG goals. This can significantly expand the networks of faculty who integrate the SDGs into their teaching and research practices. In the United States, the UN SDGs are not prominent in university culture. Through the development of an accelerator model, the Center for Sustainability will bring dozens of LIU faculty members into communication and collaboration around the UN SDGs and strengthen the university's SDG culture. The accelerator model identifies and tracks campus leaders (or change agents) who are trained to mentor and support new faculty in our campus SDG network of interdisciplinary co-learners. After introducing this digital platform, the speakers will engage audience members in an interactive exercise to explore the benefits of GTLIU for other universities.",640,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),technology,digital tools",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Scott Carlin,640,Associate Professor,Kristen Royal,640,Graduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9303/1430_Carlin_0656.pdf,,,
An Environmental Sustainability Badge Program Using Co-Curricular and Community Service Learning,"Integrating environmental sustainability community service learning into curriculum requires faculty, staff, and community engagement. Students and faculty that are passionate about implementing change in the community are developing mutually beneficial project partnerships beyond the campus. This requires collaboration and organization between the environmental sustainability office, faculty, and community partners. Central Community College's badge program empowers and rewards community stakeholders and students to support, build, and grow sustainability practices across multi-campus communities. With a combination of identified courses and co-curricular community projects, students can be officially awarded a badge on their transcript. These badges verify that the student has various sustainability skills that are applicable across diverse academic disciplines, foster community engagement towards a sustainable projects and education, and they gain exposure to local, regional, and national employers. Building the badge program after the initial pilot year in 2016-17 has increased the success of grant applications for environmental sustainability projects, connected staff better with faculty, and resulted in increased community partnerships and student engagement. This presentation will discuss our challenges and successes after our first pilot year of the badge program.

Sustainabili-TEA: The Evolution and Efficacy of Podcasts as a Medium for Sustainability Literacy,"The Office of Sustainability has seen a strong response to using Podcasts to highlight stories, perspectives, and information to the campus and greater community. The efforts were first introduced as part of an initiative modeled after NPR's StoryCorps in which subjects were interviewed about their relationship to place and the College. The lessons learned from this effort informed the creation of a designated Podcast Lead Intern position. That position today continues and has evolved over several semesters. The current format is a weekly podcast including profiles of fellow interns and Office staff to highlight the work of the Office. This has grown to include members outside the campus community, and expanded in format to include 'Sustainabili-TEA,' an informal conversation series held over a selection of tea. This initiative has successfully captured the millennial and youth affinity for Podcasts, and New Media generally, by adopting an already thriving format and focusing on condensed information and compelling content. It has offered tremendous outreach potential to the on and off campus community, not necessarily prone to sustainability literacy through more traditional mediums. This poster presentation hopes to illustrate the efficacy similar programs could have at other campuses, and to provide guidance on how best to establish and implement them. The poster will include the following: -A description of the motivation for creating podcasts through the Office of Sustainability -Details about each subsection of podcast topics -An examination of what makes podcasts an effective medium for spreading information -Details about what the Lead Intern personally gained from conducting and editing interviews -Tips on how to replicate the program at other campuses -Explication on all the above.",5047,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,Sustainability Office,,communications,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Tanner Glaze,5047,"Lead Intern, Office of Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Co-Curricular Learning and Sustainable Development Competencies: Towards Research Collaboration,"This session will enable participants to compare and contrast practice and identify opportunities and challenges to developing students' competencies to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) via co-curricular activity. The session offers a distinctive contribution by both its thematic content (bringing together the themes of Co-Curricular Learning, Competencies and the SDGs) and its intended focus on international knowledge exchange leading to potential collaborative research projects. The Co-curriculum can be viewed as structured student learning experiences that sit outside of taught programmes. Potential sites of co-curricular learning include student societies, volunteering experiences, educational visits, work-based placements, mentoring sessions and study skills support. Competencies are widely recognised as a key enabler of action for sustainable development and include reflective capabilities, systemic thinking and transdisciplinary collaborative working. Such competencies can be developed via action learning through real-world projects, making co-curricular activity an effective complement to taught courses. The national, local and institutional context in which co-curricular activities are developed plays a key role in shaping what is feasible and effective.",353,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,Research,,,,,Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Andrew Reeves,353,"Senior Lecturer, Institute of Energy and Sustainable Development", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9852/1645_Reeves_1031.pdf,,,

Fast-tracking a Comprehensive Responsible Leadership Initiative Highlighting the UN 2030 SDGs,"The College of Business Administration at Kent State University became an advanced signatory to PRME and an associate member of GRLI in Spring 2017. We introduced our Responsible Leadership Initiative (RLI) in Fall 2017, which promotes business as a force for good and utilizes the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to provide a framework and common language for educating students and involving faculty and staff. The RLI is supported by the College's core values of respect, ethics, collaboration and a sense of purpose in all we do. Our SDG awareness campaign creatively targeted students and faculty. Students were introduced to the SDG's through social media (Snapchat), participative iconography (SDG Banner & tiles) and a variety of reinforcement activities in the classroom. We created a SDG focused student group (oikos / Net Impact), SDG focused international student trips (France, Greece, India), an RLI website and a new leadership minor incorporating the SDGs. We informed faculty of their collective teaching efforts and SDG-related research, and hosted a faculty workshop with a panel of corporate sustainability professionals and a student delegate to the United Nations. Moving forward, the College will continue to fuel this momentum by engaging the professional community through incorporating the SDGs in College sponsored events and promoting the benefits of hiring students with a strong focus and understanding of sustainable development.",3862,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,"Business, Management, & Finance",,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),Principles for Responsible Management Education",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Cathy DuBois,3862,Associate Dean.

Placed-based Education in Co-Curricular Programs: Bringing Global Goals to Local Places,"Placed-based education has been a core component of the sustainability across the curriculum movement for more than 10 years. However, applying sense of place to co-curricular learning has made less progress among sustainability professionals in higher education. As we rise to the challenge of the achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we need practical applications of these goals in our local sustainability education programs. Dickinson College has developed innovative long-term and short-term programs for students that exemplify place-based learning that connects with global SDGs, outside the classroom. The presentation will highlight a three day, sustainability-focused pre-orientation and first year mentor program, and an experiential learning series, 'Exploring Our Place'. Both of these programs have successfully translated Global SDG's to practical, local co-curricular learning experiences through places, people, and processes. These learning models can be replicated by any institution looking to use local resources and issues as a way to engage students in the environmental, economic and social challenges facing our world. Place-based education is a proven pedagogy that has helped Dickinson connect experiences outside the classroom to our successful sustainability across the curriculum initiative. This session will leave participants brainstorming ways to utilize 'place' as a way to strengthen existing co-curricular sustainability programs.",3185,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,,,,,"experiential learning,sense of place,Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Lindsey Lyons,3185,Assistant Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8100/0830_Lyons_0515.pdf,,,
The Campus-Community Urban Sustainability Program at LIU Brooklyn,"The Brooklyn campus of Long Island University (LIU) has recently established a Campus-Community Urban Sustainability Program (CUSP) with the support of a Humanities Connections grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. CUSP is an interdisciplinary initiative that seeks to cultivate consciousness, education, and ethical and civic engagement among all our community members, especially undergraduate students, in order to address sustainability issues as local and global citizens. The program has three main features: (1) an integrated set of courses in four disciplines (biology, English, philosophy, and adolescent education); (2) experiential learning opportunities for students through internships, service learning, and research with community collaborators; and (3) spaces and opportunities for dialogue with the campus and community. CUSP at LIU Brooklyn particularly focuses on sustainability issues associated with environmental degradation, health and wellness concerns, and social inequities that are often exacerbated in urban settings.

Northern Arizona University Sustainable Citizens Program,"We have been quite concerned about the general lack of climate science and sustainability knowledge that students have when they graduate from higher education institutions. We know that climate change is the world's greatest global challenge and that understanding the basic science behind it, as well as the three tenets of sustainability, can contribute to its remediation. NAU is rising to the challenge of addressing this gap in higher education by creating the Sustainable Citizens Program (SCP). After we identified a need to provide basic sustainability education and empowerment to students from all majors, we researched AASHE's website, other universities, and talked to peers. We couldn't find an existing program that meets these needs, so we created the innovative SCP. We are confident SCP can be used in universities across the country. After launching SCP last year we made it in the AASHE Bulletin, and universities from across the nation showed curiosity about it. SCP is a unique, interdisciplinary program that prepares students to take on sustainability challenges as individuals, community members, and professionals. Students who complete the program will have a new credential for their resume and the know-how to tackle issues of sustainability in their future profession and life. During our session, we will explain the need for the program, the behind-the-scenes details of student registration through a CMS system and Blackboard hosting, details of the 'Program Path' (also found at nau.edu/scp), content of the two required seminars (which focus on the three tenets of sustainability: social justice, economic health, and environmental stewardship), and program marketing. SCP is addressing the challenge of preparing our students to be globally aware and engaged in sustainability. It is our dream that one day, every college/university will have their own version of an SCP and that employers will expect sustainability credentials such as this on a resume.",567,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,,,,,student leadership,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Alison Faller,567,Sustainable Citizens Program Coordinator,Ellen Vaughan,567,Sustainability Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Recapturing the Learning Opportunities of University Sustainability Indicators,"In the 1990s students conducted campus environmental audits and assessments, which were often the first step towards improving university environmental practices and creating sustainability programs. These audits, often conducted as class projects, capstone projects or theses, gave students agency in a significant environmental issue, and they provided integrative, compelling, and collaborative environmental learning experiences. Today, university sustainability ratings and rankings are largely developed by organizations outside universities, with data provided by university administrators. Hundreds of colleges and universities participate in the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS) administered by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), posting information in 70 categories in public reports. Environmental Studies and Sciences (ESS) faculty and students can participate in the process of assessing university sustainability by producing their own sustainability indicator reports from the STARS data. A literature of sustainability indicators, particularly the work of Donella Meadows, describes indicators from a systems thinking perspective and explores how the selection of indicators can change system behavior by providing missing feedback or influencing a system's goals. It describes an inclusive process for developing indicators to ensure they will be meaningful to the larger community.",2660,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,,,,,"performance indicators,assessment",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Elizabeth Davey,2660,"Director, Office of Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10415/0830_Davey_1105.pdf,,,
Integrating Participatory Action Research Into Internships and Outreach - Univ of Illinois at Chicago,"The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is Chicago's only public research university with 30,000 students, 15 colleges, a hospital and a health sciences system. This session introduces Participatory Action Research (PAR) methods in the context of UIC's sustainability internship program focused on providing information about energy, conservation, and new 'smart' grid technology to the campus and community. PAR methods help identify high-priority problems, potential solutions, and create a sense of assurance that solutions are useful to constituents. The Illinois Sustainability and Energy Innovation Foundation funded this research which helps achieve UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 of affordable and clean energy. The Year 1 program included a train-the-trainer piece using education and outreach to engage our student body. Students conducted interviews with primarily fellow students and some faculty. They used their findings to develop a set of tools to engage students including an 'EcoPong' game, videos, table displays, and an energy calculator. In Year 2, students dived deeper by shadowing various employees at work. They expanded their understanding of a number of campus units, departments and organizations whose core-work, mission and values already align with sustainability issues, especially as they relate to energy use and conservation. The latest program has three major components. The students participated in three existing student-focused events to engage students.

Improving Inclusivity at Campus Farmers Market and Garden,"The University of Utah Sustainability Office coordinates an on-campus farmers market and two edible garden sites that provide students, faculty, staff, and community members with local, healthy, and sustainable food. Produce from the gardens is sold at the University of Utah Farmers Market, a campus staple located outside the Union building where it receives an estimated 5,000 walkthroughs each market. As community-based food grows in demand, how do we ensure these opportunities are inclusive? And how do we ensure that spaces and events are inviting to people of all backgrounds to create sustainable, inclusive communities? These questions led the Sustainability Office, in partnership with an environmental justice community-engaged learning course, to evaluate who was actually attending its farmers markets and to ask questions about the types of foods grown at its garden locations. At this session, review steps taken by the Sustainability Office to define and understand inclusivity issues at the U of U Farmers Market and Edible Campus Gardens and our plan to address them.",3994,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,Food & Dining,,,,,"farmer's markets,inclusion",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jessica Kemper,3994,Sustainable Food Initiatives Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
"Sustainability, Equity & Inclusivity: Diversifying the Conversation","Sustainability Weekend is a conference organized by graduate and undergraduate students from various departments at CMU. This year's theme, 'Sustainability, Inclusivity & Equity' seeks to expand the scope of environmental sustainability, bringing people to the table who would not normally engage with one another. Environmental stewardship requires deliberate collaborations across disciplines, socio-economic backgrounds, ages, and lifestyles. Throughout the planning process students reflected on how to become allies for people unlike themselves by considering the accessibility of the event and the limitations to participation. A primary goal was to build lasting relationships that bridge disciplines and the campus-community divide in a way that fosters continued dialogue beyond the event. By engaging students with different viewpoints, an emphasis was placed on constructive conversations outside of an echochamber. Panels on foodscapes, transportation, community resilience, and technology were curated to ensure diverse stakeholder representation to foster interdisciplinary perspectives. Participants include academic researchers, industry, local community advocates, start-ups and policy makers as well as speakers addressing the environmental reality of native communities and climate communication in faith-based spaces. In addition, a 'learning lunch' is organized with local vendors which serves as an example of how to support sustainability efforts within the local community.",2849,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,Public Engagement,,,,,"events,equity,inclusion",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Nicole Shi,2849,Materials Science and Engineering & Engineering and Public Policy Double Major,Tamara Amin,2849,Graduate Student,Chun Ming Jeffrey Zhang,2849,Co-President, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10255/1300_Shi_0252.pdf,,,
Urban Emerald,"Four miles from Manhattan on 25 acres in Jersey City is the nearly 150 year old Saint Peter's University..A United Nations NGO, SPU has a Jesuit, Catholic mission committed to sustainable practices. With energy efficient upgrades back to 2003, the University's president signed ACUPCC (now Climate Leadership Network) in 2008 and the Catholic Climate Covenant in 2016. Since 2012, the Sustainability Council, consisting of students, faculty, and staff, shepherds the many programs, events,& activities that focus on sustainability and well-being of SPU & the surrounding community. The Council collaborates with SAVE (Students Against Violating the Earth), academic departments, offices, local and statewide organizations. In 2015 Pope Francis issued the encyclical Laudato Si' calling us to care for our common home. Through its Ignatian pedagogy, service, & social justice, SPU seeks to fulfill this philosophy in and out of its classrooms. Today, 25% of undergraduates have ESL; 50% are first generation college; 70% from minority backgrounds; 50% from low-income families. This presentation seeks to reveal how this Urban Emerald, with very limited resources advances many of the SDGs and is a model for other institutions. Highlights: G1 - Education as a pathway out of poverty. Generous aid; comprehensive Academic Success Program; Center for English Language Acquisition and Culture. G2: Campus Kitchen staffed by students since 2014 delivered over 36,000 meals to needy with 39,000 pounds of reclaimed fresh food. G3: SPU went entirely smoke-free & tobacco-free in Fall 2017.

Countdown to Nowruz 2018,"The development of sustainability-focused homes on the campuses of college and universities has the potential to have significant and profound impacts on the teaching, research, and service missions of these institutions. Currently however, most investments in these projects are focused on the creation of the facilities, and less so on leveraging the long-term value of the facilities. To expand the offerings of an existing solar home at Penn State main campus, on 2/27/2018, World NGO Day, we designed a welcoming and developmental experiences for our community: an invitation to celebrate Persian New Year.

PSEG Institute for Sustainability Studies Green Team Internship Program,"The Green Teams program is a one-of-a-kind multi-institutional internship program targeted to upper level undergraduates from any discipline who are interested in Sustainability. Green Teams are transdisciplinary teams of students who serve corporations, organizations, non-profits, municipalities and community groups to address substantial Sustainability issues identified by host organizations. Teams of 5 students are constructed from acceptable applicants coming from many different disciplines and multiple institutions, and whose backgrounds match those required to achieve deliverables requested by corporations and organizations. To ensure students are well positioned to produce high quality deliverables, PSEG ISS provides trainings throughout the course of the program in core Sustainability subjects, hands-on experience with Sustainability skills, and guidance in professional development. Students attend trainings, visit field sites and engage in enrichment and volunteer activities, attend meetings with corporate representatives, and work on their projects and deliverables the remainder of the time. They work intensively 40 hours per week for 10 weeks. Students use information gained to carry out projects and develop deliverables that meet a variety of corporate and municipal needs. Green Teams students work on projects including, but not limited to, wastewater management, renewable energy feasibility, waste management, greenhouse gas emissions inventory, watershed management, green building analysis, corporate social responsibility and sustainability reporting. As a result of the program, student interns are much better capable of entering into their respective careers with a background and education in solving local and global sustainability issues.",158,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,,internships,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Amy Tuininga,158,Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10070/1430_Tuininga_1061.pdf,,,
Grassroots: Connecting Diverse Louisville Communities Through Sustainable Initiatives,"The environmental threat of food waste looms over the United States alongside the imminent threat of hunger. Watching food on campus being thrown away or composted, Erin and Henny believed one solution could address both concerns: organizing a Food Recovery Network. While Erin and Henny were cofounding the University of Louisville's chapter of the Food Recovery Network in their spring 2018 semesters, they realized the opportunity that arose to create bridges between diverse communities on and off campus through sustainable actions. They used this organization, alongside other sustainability resources such as the campus Free Store, garden commons, and student groups such as Eco Reps, GRASS, and Green House, to unite diverse student populations and community members in promoting sustainability education and fulfilling various needs within the community. The need for sustainability is ever-present, but is often times left unaddressed. With hopes to encourage more eco-conscious action, Henny and Erin propose we promote sustainable efforts with a community mindset to develop unity, with hopes to address both environmental action and the social needs of their community. In this panel, they propose an open forum discussion on the uniting elements of sustainability by sharing how they've attempted to bring various populations together, and how others have done this within their campus and community. Erin and Henny hope to foster creativity and the spread of ideas, so that they and others can bring home new methods of building bridges through sustainable efforts.",1647,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Food & Dining,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,"food waste,food recovery,hunger",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Erin Kurtz,1647,Zero Waste Intern,Henrietta Ransdell,1647,"Student, Department of Sustainability Communications Intern", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9332/1430_Ransdell_0677.pptx,,,
Fighting Food Waste on College Campuses,"BACKGROUND: An estimated 40% of food produced in the US goes uneaten, yet 1 in 8 Americans struggle with hunger. And that number may be even higher on college campuses, according to some studies. Wasting food also wastes water, energy and often wildlife habitat, and it has additional negative environmental impact when it goes to landfill by emitting harmful climate change-causing gases, like methane. How can we prevent food from being wasted? WHAT: WWF and ASU are working to develop a national food waste awareness program to be implemented across higher education campuses in the spring of 2019, to bring attention to the environmental impacts of wasting food and spark a conversation around possible solutions to this problem on campus. TOGETHER POSSIBLE: Our plan is to partner with groups already engaged with food recovery and hunger on campuses such as the Food Recovery Network, Swipe Out Hunger, DC Central Kitchen's Campus Kitchens, Presidents United to Stop Hunger and more, and to ask universities and colleges to host a post-consumer food waste awareness program in dining halls, so that students can learn about the food waste produced daily on their campus. What gets measured, gets managed. We hope this hands-on experience will help students understand the magnitude of this issue and become better educated about the impacts of food waste from both a food security and environmental perspective, and to start conversations across campus about how this could be solved.",4531,3691,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Food & Dining,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,"food waste,food recovery,hunger",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Susan Norton,4531,"Program Manager, University Sustainability Practices",Krista Hicks,3691,Sustainability Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
The Campus Kitchens Project: Connecting the Campus and the Community,"For more than 15 years The Campus Kitchens Project has been empowering students around the country to recover and transform would-be-wasted food into meals to feed members of their community facing food insecurity. To date, The Campus Kitchens Project network has recovered and transformed more than 7 million pounds of food into over 3 million meals for community members experiencing food insecurity. The work being done by 63 schools within The Campus Kitchens Project network relates mainly to the sustainable development goals of ending poverty and hunger while also promoting good nutrition, and promoting well being for all ages. This workshop will explore how The Campus Kitchens Project model aims to fight hunger differently, by addressing the causes of hunger rather than just hunger by itself. It will focus on building relationships both on and off campus, as participants learn to use an asset-based community development model to build partnerships, identify need, manage volunteers and effectively run their own nonprofit programs, much like the work being done at all Campus Kitchen chapters. Other topics of conversation for this workshop include students going 'beyond the meal' as they engage their community members in nutrition education, anti-isolation activities, snap enrollment, and food insecurity awareness to target some of the root causes of hunger. Participants will be tasked to use the asset-based model to assess their own communities and brainstorm solutions.",7663,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Food & Dining,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,"food waste,food recovery,hunger",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Margot Nitschke,7663,Northeast Regional Program Specialist, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10291/1415_Nitschke_0127.pdf,,,
Urban green spaces connecting people and place,"The following concept is a new project designed for the Arizona State University Polytechnic campus; the development and implementation of an urban green space titled The Lot @ ASU, that serves as a multifunctional outdoor learning center by embracing sustainable land design and student connections to people and place. This space will meet the educational, emotional and spiritual needs of the campus and support the university goal of developing our campus as the Nexus of Food, Water and Energy. There is mounting evidence that natural environments offer multiple benefits to humans in the areas of stress relief, nutritional health, and mental health plus provide a type of nature therapy that can have a lasting effect. Positive relationships between social and environmental urban spaces are said to enhance human longevity and mental health, and therefore should be considered in the built environment. This project highlights the lasting benefits of developing urban green spaces in university and college settings. We will design, develop and build this green space in the heart of the campus to promote connections to people and place by providing an atmosphere that encourages creativity, adaption and collaboration or 'A New Community'. The Lot will showcase sustainable land design and management, promote social interactions and support healthy living attributes, plus support the goal of providing 'A New Environment', in which to learn, engage, and share. The development of this new urban green space will accentuate ASU's interdisciplinary themes and become an important component to the overall student experience. Studies show that connecting with nature helps to reduce stress, enhance creativity, and promote clarity. Our vision includes themed areas; a community garden for organic food production, an interfaith space for meditation or prayer, a distinguished entry that serves as a welcome point to the campus, an outdoor learning center and an urban orchard.",4531,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Food & Dining,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,"sense of place,urban focus,gardens,campus grown foods",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Susan Norton,4531,"Program Manager, University Sustainability Practices", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
"Synergies in Sustainable Food Systems for Students, by Students","In 2017, students, faculty, and staff at the College of Charleston were compelled by Charleston YOUth Count's data administered by the Joseph P. Riley Jr. Center for Livable Communities. It revealed that 30% of CofC students are food-insecure, with this issue affecting marginalized communities most. Through synergistic relationships with The Office of Sustainability, CofC Sustainable Agriculture, Aramark, Cougar Food Pantry, Charleston YOUth Count, The Stone Soup Collective, Tri-County Food Alliance, and local organizations, there are numerous opportunities for students to contribute to the fight for food justice. Quality education at our college can only happen after basic needs are met, thus, by growing food in green spaces, distributing food regularly, and replacing negative stigmas of being in need with support, our campus can be the change. By encouraging students to participate in these initiatives, we hope to highlight the urgency for more locally sourced, nutritious food and boldly communicate that help is available. These options take the forms of free food pick-up from food pantry and gardens, Swipe Away Hunger meals in cafeteria, and soup from the Stone Soup Collective chapter. Educating our community about nutritious food production is the gateway to fighting food insecurity and reducing energy leaks within efforts. These efforts address food production, consumption quantity and behaviors, food origin, and the externalities of the food system. Aside from our school, non-profit, Food Trust, has pinpointed various food desserts in South Carolina, with the majority being in the tri-county area, thus we hope these solution could be implemented in other local communities. Hungry students should be empowered by their campus with ways they can access healthy food to fuel their academic mission and life.

Student Funded Initiatives & the Intersections of Social Justice & Sustainability,"This is going to address clear and tangible ways students can have agency and autonomy over some of their Student Activity Fees in order to create more than just a 'Green Fund' which can help to provide students, staff, and faculty ways to fund important efforts, initiatives, and events that promote and further support a more just and sustainable future. What we will look at is how this is also an opportunity for the voices from marginalized groups who have often been unheard can participate more in this creating a more equitable, and inclusive sustainability movement at our schools. We'll also explore some of the programs and events that we at Portland Community College have done that involve food insecurity, women's health and empowerment, social/environmental justice work, and some of the classic sustainability initiatives that have improved our school, like learning gardens at all four campuses, cob structures (ovens and sheds), water filling stations, reusable dining ware, and composting systems. This will be a presentation format that will welcome plenty of audience engagement and participation. By examining and exploring the intersections of social justice and sustainability through this student funded program, we will also help to illuminate how intrinsically connected these two areas truly are. Ideally, at the end of this we can all feel even more connected moving forward and genuinely appreciate even more that we are all in this together.",2505,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Food & Dining,,,,,,"food security,green funds,students",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Teri Fane,2505,"Student Body President ~ Cascade Campus, Portland Community College",Joe Culhane,2505,Sustainability Communications Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8423/1130_Culhane_0810.pdf,,,
Student Oriented Sustainability Projects on a Small Educational Campus,"In learning about sustainability practices, students acquire more knowledge through an active process of engagement, by constructing new ideas and working on projects, rather than traditional teaching practices such as the classroom lecture. Also, the learning is contextual and is acquired through experience and involvement in real-world situations. At SUNY Canton, a small university in Northern New York, I realized that teaching Introduction to Environmental Science as a general education requirement course, it would make the most sense if students were assigned sustainability projects that they could work upon. Concomitantly, two major projects were accomplished by students. The first one project involved establishing a Pollinator Garden on Campus. It served as a team building activity where students learned the problems of environmental degradation and habitat loss that has led to decline in bee and butterfly populations. They made efforts to tackle the problem and help spread awareness by creating a habitat for pollinators. Another similar successful project was the undertaking of composting of pre consumer food waste mixed with yard waste to mitigate carbon emissions from transporting and landfilling of wastes and also saving costs on buying fertilizer for our campus. The matured compost is currently being used in the flower beds and pollinator garden on SUNY Canton's campus. So far, the 21,000 pounds of waste used in the compost saved $2,800 in just waste removal costs. We added a second pile to our composting efforts which is expected to double savings and further reduce waste to landfill. This year the students are working on creating a tree nursery on campus so that we grow our own trees to be planted campus wide. The student-led projects have overcome little resources to make a great impact on SUNY Canton's campus.",1403,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Grounds,Waste,,,,,"living labs,pollinators,compost,students",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Rajiv Narula,1403,Faculty, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9127/1430_Narula_0468.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9127/1430_Narula_0468_1016_180939.pptx,,
Paying for Sustainability: Creating a Relationship With Institutional Advancement,"Over the years, the percentage of alumni giving to their alma maters has been declining. Lower alumni giving not only means less income; it also lowers an institution's standing in national rankings, such as in U.S. News and World Report. To address this, university advancement/development offices are looking for new ideas to engage alumni. Sustainability initiatives offer a unique opportunity to connect with alumni who might not be interested in traditional engagement around athletic success or supporting general scholarships. At the same time, many sustainability offices are in need of additional funding to implement transformational initiatives. These two factors mean that staff from sustainability offices should be working to cultivate relationships with their institution's advancement offices. This session will help attendees understand how institutional advancement offices operate, and will share tips on how to discuss sustainability fundraising opportunities with your advancement and alumni staff. We will cover guidelines on crafting projects to propose to donors, and share specific examples of successful fundraising to support co-curricular opportunities and faculty development in sustainability. Additionally, we will share our tools for maintaining connections with your student partners (interns, club leaders, etc.) after they graduate.

Ideas into Actions: The ECOllective Fund and Student-led Sustainability Initiatives at CofC,"Each semester at the College of Charleston, students pay a 'Green Fee,' established in the fall of 2009 of $10 that is put into a fund that we call the 'ECOllective Fund'. This fund, which was formally established in the fall of 2011, supports multiple projects and initiatives that make contributions to all aspects of sustainability on campus. A portion of this fund is also set aside specifically to fund student-led projects that aim to 'educate the campus community, encourage positive action for society and the environment, provide research data, and promote collaboration of various academic disciplines' (sustainability.cofc.edu). This funding is administered by the ECOllective Student Project Committee (ESPC), a committee recruited by and composed entirely of College of Charleston students. To secure ECOllective funding for a project, students have the opportunity to work collaboratively with a case manager from ESPC to complete the online application process and then hopefully, make their sustainability project a reality here on our campus. Student project leaders can apply to receive one of two levels of funding, small-scale and full-scale. Expedited small-scale projects can be awarded up to $500, and the application is typically open year-round. Full-scale projects can be awarded up to $5,000, which is typically granted at the end of the semester. It is the hope of the Office of Sustainability that this fund will serve as a model for other universities across the country hoping to further student-driven sustainability initiatives across their campuses. This fund not only helps give students experience in grant writing, develop presentation skills, and enhance leadership abilities, but it also gives students an opportunity to transform their ideas into actions and to create a tangible, sustainable difference on campus that will benefit other students for years to come.",5047,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Investment & Finance,,,,,,"green funds,students",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Brynn Smith,5047,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Evaluating and improving the UDC student's knowledge on the campus sustainability projects,"Abstract: This research examines the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) student's knowledge on the campus sustainability projects and evaluates three intervention techniques to enhance the student's knowledge and awareness. Eight non-environmental-science majored, undergraduate classes (105 students in total) participated in this research. The students divided into two groups: intervention and non-intervention groups. The non- intervention classes (29 students) considered as our baseline. The intervention group is further divided into three sub-groups and was invited to be involved in a level of sustainability educational intervention. The interventions include: sustainability signage (23 students), sustainability lecture (32 students), and in-person tour (21 students) of the UDC sustainability projects. Each intervention lasted for 20 minutes and the students in each intervention were exposed to the UDC sustainability projects, which was followed by a survey. Findings show that just 28% of our baseline group knew about the UDC sustainability projects. The interventions significantly increased the student's knowledge on the UDC sustainability projects. In lecture intervention group, 58% of the students indicated good knowledge of the projects after going through a 20 minutes presentation. The Tour and Signage Intervention groups also indicated 48% and 27% awareness respectively after going through a 20 minutes intervention. Regression results show moving from signage intervention to tour and lecture intervention, on average, increases students' awareness by 0.76 sustainability knowledge score (highly significant). Interestingly, regression analysis also shows that the older and Hispanic students are more aware of sustainability challenges compare to younger and non-Hispanic students.",4789,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,,"culture of sustainability,assessment",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Kamran Zendehdel,4789,Assistant Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9011/1430_Zendehdel_0316.pdf,,,

The Intersectionality of the Arts and Environmental Activism,"At the University of Denver, the Center for Sustainability has established a Zero Waste Program at all sports games, and the average diversion rate of waste from landfill is approximately 90%. The Zero Waste team also works to establish zero waste habits in the library and other buildings on campus, but until recently, there has never been any Zero Waste programming in the Newman Center for Performing Arts. The most recent student-run initiative to increase diversion rates across campus at the University of Denver is the incorporation of Zero Waste and the arts. In 2016, a student submitted a proposal for the installation of two tri-bins, one on the practice room floor for students and one in the atrium for audience members. She also proposed the idea for Zero Waste concerts. The goal of this project is to inspire conversation amongst performers and concert attendees about the environment in which they create, share, and listen to music. The Newman Center for the Performing Arts displays artists who express social justice concerns which serve as powerful tools for social change, but the Lamont School of Music, in combination with the Newman Center, needs to educate their students, audiences, and performers about environmental practices to foster holistic sustainability. Through this, the University of Denver would move toward becoming a just and inclusive institution as described under the United Nations' Goal 16 for Sustainable Development. Since 2016, the Center for Sustainability has piloted three Zero Waste concerts with an average of a 90% diversion rate whereas 100% of waste produced usually goes straight to landfills. Most recently, there has been an installation of a tri-bin in the Joy Burns Plaza of the Newman Center and one on the practice room floor of the Lamont School of Music. In the future, the Center will establish all concerts as Zero Waste to create greater engagement between the arts and environmental sustainability.",2186,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,Waste,,,,,"arts & culture,zero waste",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Halle Brown,2186,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Advancing Organizational Change for Sustainable Development Goals Through Neuropsychology,"What role does neuropsychology play as a determinant for successful organizational change toward Sustainable Development Goals?

Using a synthesis of nascent literature and review of best practices, this interactive session encourages consideration of what, if any, incongruity exists between higher education outputs and the unmet needs of society's most excluded and marginalized members as foundational to scaling a new futures-oriented mindset that mitigates the sustainability paradox and moves our colleges and universities toward SDG achievement.",2940,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,"Behavior Sciences (Social Work, Counseling Psychology, etc.)",,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),organizational change",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Matthew Mayer,2940,"USC Doctoral Student, Organizational Change", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8006/1045_Mayer_0425.pptx,,,
Reel Sustainability: Connecting to Audiences Through Video Storytelling,"From television commercials to YouTube, Snapchat, and even Facebook Live, it's no secret that video has become a staple of our everyday lives. Video provides an easy and efficient way to reach audiences through an attractive, versatile, and shareable medium. Video can help to illustrate complex and sometimes politically divisive topics such as climate change or the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and can even direct viewers to a specific call of action. But videos can be incredibly challenging to create, taking up a lot of time, energy, and resources, and may not always have the direct impact you intended. This panel will showcase a diverse collection of 5-6 videos from institutions across the country, all with different production quality, intended audiences, content/theme, and impact. Furthermore, the panelists will identify ways that the videos were shared, how they were received, and what kind of measurable action they had among the campus community. We will also discuss lessons learned during the video-making process and open up the room for a dialogue about making and sharing sustainability videos to achieve the greatest impact.",2597,4473,4237,2529,3931,2697,2797,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,,"telling stories,communications",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Lisa Nicolaison,2597,Engagement and Communications Coordinator,Sharon Daraphonhdeth,4473,"Director, Student Environmental Resource Center",Sonia Marcus,4237,Director of Sustainability,Eva Rocke,2529,Sustainability Staff,Kelly Weisinger,3931,Sustainability Staff,Susy Jones,2697,Project Manager,Molly Blumhoefer,2797,Campus as a Living Lab & Sustainability Project Manager, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8061/0915_Nicolaison_0487.pptx,,,
Academic Libraries Fostering Resilient Communities,"Every institution of higher education already has an academic library that can be a partner in campus sustainability. This program offers specific ideas for how faculty, sustainability staff and administrators can make better use of existing library resources and will seed new ideas for how your own library can become a more integral part of campus sustainability. In 2013, the American Library Association formed a Sustainability Round Table (SustainRT) with an agenda of 'libraries fostering resilient communities.' Since then, academic librarians have been working together to advance sustainability both in academics and campus operations. After the initial disruption of the digital age, academic libraries have re-imagined themselves as community centers. While libraries retain a core mission to share things (not just books) and to support the campus community, they are also expanding into new areas of service. Typically, academic librarian-liaison assignments mirror the subject-based structure of academic departments but sustainability blurs the line between academics and praxis so that campus libraries have taken on a campus-wide role to provide information for sustainable facilities, planning and community engagement. In the age of climate change, libraries can even serve as centers to help rebuild community resilience after a disaster. The presentation begins with a brief overview of the activities of SustainRT given by a SustainRT board member and a short PechaKucha style.",3994,4465,439,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,,libraries,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Amy Brunvand,3994,Librarian,Jeanne Pfander,4465,"Associate Librarian, Liaison to the College of Agriculture & Life Sciences",Eric Tans,439,Science Collections Coordinator and Environmental Sciences Librarian, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8200/0915_Pfander_0602.pdf,,,
Develop Your Toolkit for Sustainability Communications ,"Communications play an increasingly important role as we rise to the challenge to reach the global Sustainable Development Goals. However, many sustainability professionals may find their toolkit a bit empty when trying to navigate the communications arena. This entry-level workshop will map out the essential elements in a sustainability communications strategy, introduce best practices, and help participants to get started with a well-rounded sustainability communications campaign. This workshop will discuss: university and departmental branding; newsletter basics; social media do's and don'ts; best practices for news and blog writing; audience and analytics; web content management; video and content creation; and relationship building with your university's communications department. After reviewing the above topics, participants will work with the presenters and their colleagues to develop a component of a communications plan for sustainability at their institution.",4155,4058,2597,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,Communications & Marketing,,communications,10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Pamela Gramlich,4155,Sustainability Staff,Nathan Jandl,4058,"Communications Director, Office of Sustainability",Lisa Nicolaison,2597,Engagement and Communications Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8410/1300_Nicolaison_0799.pptx,,,
Communication Strategies to Reach Beyond the Choir,"Often times, sustainability professionals and communicators can reach a plateau when working to reach new audiences. Our institutions can often be so siloed that it is challenging to draw in new audiences to build a larger, more inclusive sustainability story in your community. This presentation will share the communication strategies four institutions have used to reach 'beyond the choir' and engage new audiences in sustainability. This presentation will discuss best practices for working with campus communications, engaging campus partners and utilizing innovative, 'outside of the box' communication tools. Expanding reach and improving sustainability communications can help our institutions to rise to the challenge to meet our global goals.

Mobilizing Colleges with Earth Integrity Training,"Earth Integrity Training (EIT) is a program for colleges to mobilize their communities about urgent environmental issues. It provides creative and multimedia content for a 2-3 hour seminar that colleges use to train their own employees (and can be extended to students). EIT has the following goals: Increase awareness beyond environment-focused departments, especially since most adults have not had environmental science instruction since high school or none at all. Prepare students and the rest of the community for the challenges of climate-change and resource depletion. Help create and motivate a more eco-literate electorate. Enable colleges to take a stand for accurate science and demonstrate their commitment to the environment. Explore and help overcome the widespread lack of information, denial, and unconscious fear that slows the necessary cultural shift to sustainability from occurring. The program is currently being piloted at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, taught by faculty, EHS staff, & also facilitated by Mental Health Counselors who attended Climate Psychology training. The session will cover lessons learned so far, with feedback by trainers and attendees. Background - In 1992, over 1700 independent scientists, including the majority of living Nobel laureates in the sciences, wrote the 'World Scientists' Warning to Humanity,' cautioning that 'a great change in our stewardship of the Earth and the life on it is required, if vast human misery is to be avoided,' due to Earth's ecosystems being pushed beyond their capacities to support the web of life. Data was provided to quantify ozone depletion, freshwater availability, marine life depletion, ocean dead zones, forest loss, biodiversity destruction, climate change, and continued growth of human and livestock population growth. In 2017, a second World Scientists' Warning to Humanity was issued.",7315,840,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,,"earth integrity,training",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Lindsey Kayman,7315,President,Paul Bartlett,840,EdD Grad Student / Adjunct Asst Prof., ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9284/1430_Kayman_0635.pdf,,,

Building a Consistent Sustainability Brand,"In order to reap the full benefits of consistently communicating the values and messages that are core to your sustainability brand, it is important to design brand guidelines the define the look of your communications and materials. Brand guidelines are a powerful tool that create a consistent look and feel so communications and design projects are easily recognized by faculty, staff, students, alumni, and visitors, and communicate the key sustainability values of the university. Through brand guidelines, your campus community will come to know and recognize the sustainability brand through the consistent presentation and expression of the brand in all communications and marketing. But how do you get started? What is the path to developing brand guidelines? Who needs to be involved? In this session, we will discuss Lehigh University's path to developing a branding guide, how you can choose branding elements that harmonize with your school's visual identity elements, and how you can apply the concepts in physical materials. Discussion will include topics such as: core brand objectives, logo (simple and full versions), color palette (primary and extended), typeface standards, image usage guidelines, and identity elements - do's and don'ts. The utilization of a cohesive sustainability image and brand is very important.",4140,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,,"marketing,communications",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Delicia Nahman,4140,Sustainability Officer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Activism or Silence as a Sustainability Office?,"We live in a time when activism has become a regular part of our lives and addresses a multitude of issues.

Back to Basics,"Eco-Reps is turning over a new leaf at Ohio University. This year we will focus on being a community-service based sustainability student group. Through community clean-ups, we will be actively making Ohio University and Athens a more beautiful and healthy place. Eco-Reps will also engage in a variety of outreach programs in order to help the general student body and the Athens population become more aware of sustainability concerns. This group of Eco-Reps is different from previous generations at Ohio University because we are emphasizing the community-service based approach, instead of the former weekly meeting workshops that only included group members. All volunteer opportunities organized by Eco-Reps will be open to the general population in efforts to include a greater variety of people. We are also centering our volunteer opportunities on Athens nonprofits which are not affiliated with the university. We hope by being more active in the community we will be able to help students engage with local Athens residents. By making sustainability more visible in Athens and around campus, we will be able to educate and bring together the Athens and Ohio University communities. The mission of Eco-Reps is: 'Eco-Reps is a student organization focused on offering friendly, sustainable education to its peers in a multitude of ways. We also participate in various ecological volunteer opportunities around Athens in order to improve the community and collaborate with other organizations, including the Office of Sustainability, to promote environmentalism. Eco-Reps strives to encourage a sustainable culture on and around campus by example; we aim to be personally sustainable, constantly educating ourselves about what it means to live a green lifestyle.' As a group, we are optimistic that returning to the community-service based approach will help us fulfill all the goals of our mission.",820,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,,eco-reps,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Vanessa Thiel,820,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Becoming a 'spokes' person for campus sustainability: The smoothie bike & other outreach efforts.,"Ohio University, like many universities nationally, has been affected by budget and staffing streamlining. Campus services and departments, like the Office of Sustainability, were profoundly affected. However, presidential strategies and sustainability plan benchmarks maintain that sustainability is at the forefront of university efforts. All Office of Sustainability efforts are important to generating long-term solutions, sensibly increasing efficiencies, and creating thoughtful efforts. However, campus outreach is generally the primary method in which students become engaged in sustainability. Therefore, continued and improved programming is critical to gaining momentum within the student population. The issues mentioned above have consequently pushed Ohio University's Office of Sustainability into being more innovative and creative with it programming. The proposed poster presentation aims to articulate how to become a spokesperson for sustainability within higher education settings. Specifically, targeting questions such as firstly, how to partner across interdisciplinary boundaries without losing sight of sustainability. Secondly, how to navigate sustainability subjects with individuals in positions of power. Thirdly, how to maintain sustainability focus within collaboration efforts. The following case study uses the three pillars of sustainability (people, planet, and prosperity), modern student interests, and local themes/events to develop meaningful student engagement activities. Further, information gleaned from this poster and handouts has been generated to improve sustainability outreach programming within other institutes.",820,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,,student engagement,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Vicky Kent,820,Sustainable Living Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Building and Supporting Social Movements for Institutional Change and Beyond,"Even as the campus sustainability movement has grown, the issues in our food system have continued to deepen. The average age of farmers in the U.S. is over 65, farmworkers are sickened from pesticide exposure, food chain workers are paid sub-living wages, and many communities lack access to nutritious, affordable food. Control of our food is in the hands of fewer and fewer mega-corporations, and those building sustainable alternatives are often barely hanging on. We are facing a moment of crisis and also a moment of opportunity. Looking to social movement theory and social movement case studies, this workshop will explore how the campus sustainability movement can rise to the challenges facing our food system today. Students will learn about the role they can play in advocating for a just and sustainable food system, beginning on their campuses. This workshop will also discuss the basics of campaign organizing and planning.

Fair Trade Chocolates: Raising the Challenge with Sweets,"UNCW is one of over 46 universities nationally that have embarked on a campaign to achieve Fair Trade (FT) Status by ingraining FT practices, principles, and policy into their campus communities. By using institutional buying power to source products on campus and at events, building a student team, committing to education, and passing a resolution, UNCW has engaged students, faculty, staff, and the broader community in creating a conscious impact and more informed consumerism. Embarking on this campaign has offered a platform that addresses many of the United Nations' SDGs including an emphasis on ending poverty & hunger, providing quality education, promoting reduced inequalities, facilitating decent work & economic growth, supporting responsible consumption & production, and sustainably managing life on land. This spring chocolate was used as the lens for a unique educational opportunity that facilitated cross-sector collaboration at UNCW, as well as in the local, national, and international economy. Dining hosted a FT Chocolate Pop Up Shop to create awareness about FT & the campaign, educate about cocoa production & countries of origin, and allow participants to make a conscious purchase for Valentine's Day. Event partners reached out to FT chocolate companies who generously donated samples and bulk scrap chocolates. Local businesses then turned the donations into specialty chocolates. These were sold at the event incorporating educational partners from Sustainability, Office of International Programs, and CARE: Collaboration for Assault Response & Education. All sales went to the Kuapa Kokoo, a cooperative of cocoa farmers in Ghana. Chocolate proved to be a great conversation starter that sparked interest in supporting not just a more locally sustainable community, but globally as well. The session will include lessons learned, offer insight on how to incorporate FT at your campus, and allow for discussion of how to expand on this idea with other FT products.",740,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Purchasing,,,,,,fair trade,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Marie Davis,740,Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Campus Sustainability: A Motivational Analysis for Change,"Current business practices are a leading source of environmental degradation, especially employee actions in the workplace that generate excessive waste to landfill, resource depletion, and other negative impacts. The UN's Sustainable Development Goals identify 'Responsible Consumption and Production' (GOAL 12) as a critical focus for research and practice, with particular emphasis on encouraging companies to adopt sustainable practices (12.6) and ensuring that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for lifestyles in harmony with nature (12.8). This study adds to understanding in this domain by identifying the attitudes and motivations driving PEB (Pro-Environmental Behavior) within key constituencies in a campus setting. Results are intended to guide effective targeted interventions to increase of sustainability awareness and practice on campus and in other organizational settings. Three phases of survey research over a 10yr period assessed pro-environmental attitudes, beliefs, values and behavioral intentions within campus populations. Findings indicate 'environmental concern' as the primary driver of PEB for every subgroup, with motivations for PEB differing between groups. 'Instrumentality' (measured as 'I believe my actions make a difference') had the greatest impact for undergraduates and staff, while 'empowerment' (measured as 'environmental responsibility is a priority for me') had the greatest impact for graduates and faculty.",6169,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,,behavior change,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,DEBORAH DELONG,6169,Assoc Professor of Marketing,Mary Whitney,6169,Director of University Sustainability, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8387/1400_DELONG_0782.pptx,,,
How to Podcast Your Way to a More Environmentally Sustainable and Socially Just Future,"In this session we'll be looking at the journey of starting a Higher Education Sustainability Podcast and how it can be something that could benefit nearly every college or university in the nation. Portland Community College has a Podcast called 'PCC, Sustain Me!' and it started out with the intentions of exploring the many levels and ways that PCC as an institution was addressing Sustainability, Environmental Justice, and the 17 Sustainability Development Goals. This process involved creating a series interviewing members of PCC from bottom to top including students leaders, instructors, faculty/administrators, board members, and working its way up to the college President, Mark Mitsui. By creating this rather comprehensive look at Portland Community College as an institution, this podcast is creating a qualitative way to illuminate all the different levels of sustainability and social justice, equity, and inclusion efforts the school is making. It's accessible because it is story telling. By replicating this podcast each higher education institution can create a more transparent dialogue that can provide great potential for better efficiency and ways to remove redundancies in programming or efforts as well as opportunities for engagement from students who may see ways the school can improve its actions and/or commitments. The session will include reflections on the trials and tribulations of starting a podcast, suggestions for tools, tips and tricks too!",2505,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,,"communications,podcasts",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Joe Culhane,2505,Sustainability Communications Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8512/1045_Culhane_0910.pdf,,,
CU Boulder Tests Behavior-Tracking Platform's Effect on Student Engagement in Sustainability,"What if a more engaged student was also a more successful student?' Research in fact bears this out. And 'what if there were an App that helped to deepen engagement among students in behaviors that drive up success?' These fundamental questions prompted Dave Newport, Director of the Environmental Center at CU Boulder, to persuade the University to beta-test in academic year 2017-18 an innovative new motivation-engagement platform, called PIPs Rewards. The purpose of the pilot was to see whether student engagement with an App that tracked and rewarded verifiable beneficial behaviors - such as riding the bus, biking, bike sharing, recycling, refilling water bottles, volunteering and participation in sustainability events - could at once turn these positive impact behaviors into habits and boost retention rates. Once earned, students can redeem their PIPs for discounts on healthy and responsibly sourced food, textbooks, fitness classes, responsibly made clothing, gear rentals and more or donate them to a charity. And come spring, students will be able to earn and use PIPs for and to achieve financial wellness goals. Few sustainability engagement apps require action verification. What also makes the PIPs App unique is it so light and low-friction that many actions are tracked without a user taking her phone out of her pocket. This makes the data analytics the app gathers about user engagement in purpose, sustainability, health and financial wellness behaviors.",8284,2130,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,,"behavior change,technology,incentives",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Rebecca Horton,8538,PIPs Rewards Affiliate,Spencer Turk,8538,PIPs Rewards Associate,Dave Newport,2130,"Director, Environmental Center", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7966/1045_Horton_0384.pdf,,,
Partnering Student Green Advisors With Staff Advocates: Swarthmore's Innovative Eco-Reps Model,"This session will showcase an innovative Eco-Reps model at Swarthmore College that partners a paid, student internship program (the Green Advisors) with a voluntary staff program (the Sustainability Advocates). I will describe the three-year design process of these two programs, an overview of the SDG-heavy training that the Office of Sustainability provides to each of the two groups, and how they collectively have been a vehicle for accelerating the College's recent Zero Waste commitment. In studying national Eco-Rep models, we have not found programs that match student and staff as liaisons in this novel way. A brief description of the two programs is below: The 20 student Green Advisors (GAs) work as paid interns on three fronts for a full academic year. First, they serve as peer leaders in the residence halls, collaborating closely with RAs. In this role, they play an essential function in waste management during move-in and move-out. Second, they are key players in the operation of the College's campus-wide compost system, as they manually sort contamination from the compost stream in daily shifts and support custodial staff in compost bin pick-ups. Finally, they are each partnered, one-to-one, with a Sustainability Advocate department to provide their expertise to staff who have volunteered to lead small-scale, departmental sustainability projects. The GAs receive a full week of training on myriad and complex sustainability topics just prior to New Student Orientation.",3879,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,,"eco-reps,internships,on-campus collaboration",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Melissa Tier,3879,Sustainability Program Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8116/1045_Tier_0526.pdf,,,

Green Gurus Unite! Discussing the Promise and Perils of Becoming Your School's Moral Compass,"We were flooded with requests to set something up to continue the conversation at the conclusion of our lively, well-attended 30-minute 'High Priests of Sustainability?!' presentation at AASHE 2017. This topic was clearly resonant for our colleagues at other institutions and there is an obvious need for more space to discuss these issues. So let's do it! Whether we are brand new on the job, or have been in a Sustainability Coordinator position for decades, we have all been there. It is that awkward moment when we are introduced not by our actual titles, but by some weird euphemism that tells us how people on campus really see us: 'Our Green Guru,' 'Our Sustainability Guy/Person,' 'Our Sustainability Czar,' 'Our Sustainability Queen,' 'Our Sustainability Maven,' 'The Face of Sustainability,' 'The Vehicle for Sustainability,' 'The Creator of Our Sustainability Initiatives,' or even 'The Conscience of the University.' We also find ourselves faced with colleagues coming to us with 'confessions' about their 'green sins' or, conversely, seeking affirmation for their good green deeds. Something is going on here that needs to be explored. What does all this mean and how can we respond appropriately? What are the implications of this kind of a role for sustainability professionals?

"Addressing Sustainable Development Goals: Non-profit, Campus and Community Collaborations","With a theme of 'Global Goals: Rising to the Challenge,' this year's conference examines the role of higher education in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This workshop will not only offer tangible resources for those wishing to integrate the SDGs into campus and classroom initiatives, but will primarily serve as a case study for how non-profit organizations and the higher education community can collaborate in order to advance the Sustainable Development Goals. Participants will learn about the process one organization (Northwest Earth Institute) underwent in order to both conduct an organizational assessment and integrate the SDGs into programming. This workshop will share tangible steps in order to effectively integrate SDGs into programmatic offerings. Participants will leave the workshop with examples of how to conduct research and assessments, and will also discuss a variety of ways the SDGs can be integrated into existing coursework or programming on campus. Participants will consider goal-setting and will examine examples of SDG integration. Achieving the United Nations' SDGs will involve every level of community. To exemplify this, the workshop will also highlight the process of collaboration with a local community partner to advance Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Leaders of the Greater Portland Sustainability Education Network, a United Nations University Regional Center of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development (RCE) (http://gpsen.org/), will share their work forming an RCE and advancing the SDGs. They will also discuss ways in which the higher education community can partner with non-profit organizations in order to advance both the SDGs as well as deepen ESD (Education for Sustainable Development). At NWEI, we reference the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as an avenue for impact on the global scale.",3426,2505,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),community engagement",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,David Macek,3426,Executive Director,Kim Smith,2505,Sociology Instructor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8910/1430_Smith_0183.pdf,,,

Peer-to-Peer Educator Programs: Examining Four Common Styles,"Based on overwhelmingly positive feedback on the EcoReps Networking Session last year, a team of sustainability staff members from four institutions has come together to provide another opportunity for further information sharing and community support. This session will be facilitated by representatives from four different campuses with different models for their Peer Education/EcoReps Programs. Each panelist represents one of the four typical program types: Residentially Focused & Paid / Residentially Focused & Unpaid, and Campus-Wide & Paid / Campus-Wide & Unpaid. They will explain their program's beginning and current operation, including key highlights and pitfalls with the intention of illustrating some pros/cons of that model that are NOT just specific to their campuses. This will be a 25 minute panel with 5 minutes for questions. For the second half of the session, attendees will self-select into one of the four program type groups. These groups will have the rest of the meeting to discuss challenges and best practices, through a facilitated discussion led by the associated panelist. Each group will be expected to compile these session notes into a summary of considerations for each program type that can be presented at the end of the network session, and written up to be shared online as part of the growing public Google Drive folder of resources started after last year's session. There will also be time for the groups to share out or ask questions.",3995,2130,1744,2497,3209,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,,"peer-to-peer,eco-reps",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Caylin McCamp,3995,Education & Outreach Coordinator,Rayna Oliker,2130,Sustainability Manager for Residence Life,Keith Soster,1744,Director of Student Engagement,Alexis Reyes,2497,Assistant Director of Sustainability,Olivia Walcott,3209,Student Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8167/1130_McCamp_0570.pptx,,,
"Students, Sustainability, and Social Media: Tools for Content and Collaboration","Communicating sustainability efforts across social media platforms is an important but often challenging part of our work. As social media trends emerge and change, how can we convey our messaging clearly, effectively, and imaginatively?

Student Engagement through Research Experience: The U-Challenge at Texas A&M,"In the spring semester of 2017, the Department of Residence Life and Utility & Energy Services at Texas A&M partnered to host their first annual Utilities Challenge (dubbed the 'U-Challenge'). The U-Challenge is a semester-long research competition for students that has evolved over the past two years to encompass both graduate and undergraduate teams from all majors. Student teams of 4-7 people are assigned a residence hall on-campus. The teams are given data about the utility and energy consumption in the hall from the past two years. Teams work closely with our two sponsors, Siemens and Johnson Controls, and Utility & Energy Services staff to understand how their research experience can translate to any future career. They then put together a presentation on recommendations for sustainable infrastructure and increased student engagement to reduce utility and energy usage. Their presentations are delivered in two separate rounds to a panel of judges made up of faculty, staff, and professionals. Sustainability recommendations brought forth by the teams have the chance to be implemented at the largest university in Texas. In the first two years, the applications to participate surged from 12 to 60 students. Applicants come from a wide array of majors and academic classifications, with many of them working with their advisors to receive course credit in the process.",7982,2697,2357,,,,,Campus Engagement,Research,,,,,,"living labs,competitions",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Kristianna Bowles,7982,Graduate Assistant Sustainability Coordinator,Cole Perkinson,2697,Graduate Student,Phillip Purpich,2357,Account Executive, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9802/1445_Bowles.pptx,,,

"Break out of a Social Media Slump: How to Create a Strategy, Build Community & Engage Your Audience","By 2021, it's estimated that there will be more than 3 billion social media users around the world. If universities and colleges are going to be leaders in addressing the global Sustainable Development Goals, we must be able to capitalize on the power and potential of social media to build visibility, community and engagement among diverse audiences both on campus and beyond. This session will focus on two institutions: Agnes State College and the University of Florida, and how they each re-envisioned their approaches to social media. Agnes State College's Center for Sustainability underwent a social media transformation during a critical time for their programs in 2017. The Center created a working group to produce posts about the Center's initiatives, including a video series about the LEED-certification process of a building renovation project. Their focus on enhancing social media engagement resulted in increased attention from off-campus viewers, including alumnae across the nation and the college's Board of Trustees. UF's communication team revamped their lagging social media presence, using a strategy designed to build community, engage new and existing followers, and elevate the visibility of programs and campaigns. This strategy resulted in an increase in engagement across the 3 major platforms - Facebook, Instagram and Twitter - and is directly linked to an increased participation rate in behavior-change campaigns by members of the UF campus community.",494,2088,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,,"social media,behavior change",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Gianni Rodriguez,494,Climate Action Fellow,Emma Dufresne,494,Student,Allison Vitt,2088,Outreach and Communications Coordinator,Hannah Ulloa,2088,Design and Marketing, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9673/0915_Ulloa.pdf,,,

Is your staff engaged with your sustainability practices?,"At Carnegie Mellon University there are numerous sustainable practices on campus. Our presentation is to share the ways we engage the faculty, staff and students to raise awareness about green practices. Carnegie Mellon University's Strategic Plan 2025 includes sustainability as one of its seven values. Sustainability, reflected in our shared commitment to lead by example in preserving and protecting our natural resources, and in our approach to responsible financial planning. Many on campus are not aware of all the ways they are already practicing saving the environment. The programs we will discuss include Scotty Goes Green which supports and promotes offices that are taking steps toward reducing their environmental footprint. The Green Practices Committee which strives to develop university practices that improve environmental quality, decrease waste and conserve natural resources and energy, thereby establishing Carnegie Mellon as a practical model for other universities and companies.

Bees as a Bridge From Local Experiential Learning to Collaborative Global Education,"The Champlain College Apiary was established in 2013 in order to provide experiential learning opportunities for students and community members and to support the college's commitment to sustainability. This living laboratory has been incorporated into 50+ classes and extra-curricular programs, produced and sold over 1,700 pounds of honey, and hosted over 1,000 visitors from the Champlain and wider Burlington communities. It is financially self-sustaining and depends on volunteers, class projects, faculty collaboration, and independent and work study students for its labor force. After a few successful years on campus, we expanded our reach to the Peruvian Amazon with the creation of Project Beetopia, the research, education, and service endeavor started by German Perilla, director of the George Mason University's Honey Bee Initiative, and me. The mission of this project is to use beekeeping to promote individual and community empowerment, entrepreneurship, and economic self-sufficiency, while preserving natural and cultural resources. The primary research undertaken by this project is to successfully domesticate and manage endemic bee colonies as a source of medicinal and marketable honey, creating supplemental income and skills for rainforest communities. The educational aspect of Beetopia is the global studies courses developed for each of our institutions, which immerse our students in global learning through the context of the Amazon rainforest.",6009,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,,"bees,pollinators,experiential learning,living labs",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Kristin Wolf,6009,Associate Professor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Graduate Students Implement Sustainability During a Short Academic Window: Case Study Eden Hall,"Eden Hall Campus at Chatham University was built to be a living learning lab for sustainable initiatives in the Falk School of Sustainability. Although the focus of the university is for implementing sustainability, practicing sustainability by students is underutilized due to the relatively young age of the campus (3 years) and the barriers present in garnering student interest in the planning and execution of campus-wide initiatives. When compared to undergraduate students, graduate students are typically less involved in their university community due to other pressing responsibilities like full or part time work, family obligations, or long commutes. Getting graduate students involved in campus activities is a common challenge and it becomes increasingly difficult when implementing sustainable initiatives. Achieving sustainability on any level, let alone an entire university, is no easy feat. However, to truly represent a campus of sustainability ideology, graduate students need to be involved in the conversations that dictate campus sustainability to bridge the gap between class discourse and personal interest. Even though the burdens associated with graduate students presents challenges in enabling change, a more concentrated effort to include graduate students can advance sustainability measures. This poster presents a case study of Masters of Sustainability students at Eden Hall who have found and created ways to bridge this gap and contribute to sustainability efforts during their brief academic window, thus fostering a deeper connection with the campus and entire university community. The factors that have led to Masters of Sustainability students becoming involved and impacting sustainability on the Eden Hall campus will be discussed through this poster presentation.

Smith College House Sustainability Challenge,"As part of Smith College's efforts to integrate environmentally sustainable practices into institutional operations and student life, a diverse group of campus stakeholders launched the House Sustainability Challenge in 2017. The Challenge seeks to develop innovative programs and strategies that help increase student engagement in sustainability through house (dormitories) activities. The Challenge invites our students to develop programs that promote scalable, sustainable practices that can be adopted or implemented by all houses campus-wide. In the first phase of the Challenge student teams develop proposals for programs they'd like to implement in their house. Proposals are then judged by staff members from the co-sponsoring offices, and three to five teams are selected to move on to the second phase, where the teams pilot their programs. This year the proposals were judged by staff members from the co-sponsoring offices: Campus Sustainability; Center for the Environment, Ecological Design and Sustainability; Design Thinking Initiative; Jill Ker Conway Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center; and Residence Life. Proposals were judged based on the following criteria: understanding of environmentally sustainable practices, understanding of human behavior/needs, value add to the campus, innovativeness and economic feasibility. In the second phase teams receive up to $500 to fund pilot program development, during which Challenge co-sponsors provide guidance. Teams present an overview of their pilot and its impact to the judges during Earth Week at a program that is open to the campus community. The winning team receives a $1,000 grand prize for their house. Winners also receive the opportunity to work with the co-sponsors to implement their program in all 35 campus houses the following year, with the goal of providing sustainability programing that is for students, by students, and programming that creates real cultural and operational change.",4705,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,Housing & Residence Life,,competitions,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Monica Dean,4705,Director,Emma Kerr,4705,Sustainability and Communications Administrator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9163/1430_Dean_0495.pdf,,,
Interactive and Captivating: How to Create a Successful Workshop,"Texas A&M University has found the most effective way to communicate the importance of sustainability with our campus community is through interactive and engaging content. Our most successful approach has been a hands-on workshop series created by office interns. These bi-annual workshops consist of interactive activities relating to social, economic, and environmental topics. During workshops, we split the audience into groups and assign them to different interactive stations led by the interns who created them. While planning the workshops, interns focus on topics they are passionate about that are timely and relevant in hopes of generating interest in the event and captivated participants. A key for success is developing activities that lead to a direct conversation with students. At the conclusion of the workshop, participants receive a high-quality water bottle with the Texas A&M Office of Sustainability logo. Using a quality give-a-way item helps create an additional layer of incentive to attend the event, and it also promotes a sustainable lifestyle by giving students a tangible tool that makes sustainable choices easier. Finally, we advertise for the workshops through campus-wide email, tabling events, and social media.

How Do Sustainability and Resilience Work Together in Practice?,"Resilience and sustainability have had a confusing relationship over the past decade. While resilience has long been an important element of sustainability, for example going back to the work of C.S. Holling in the early 1970s within the framework of ecological and subsequently socioecological systems; and It has also long been an important concept in public health and in psychology including within the context of responding to disasters; and within the context of the IPCC, resilience was a core element of treatment of impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. But somewhere along the line, a current of resilience thinking and interests began to position it as a preferable alternative to sustainability. This was perhaps best captured by phrases such as 'Good bye sustainability, hello resilience' and 'forget sustainability, it's all about resilience,' and 'Forget Sustainability It's Time to Talk Resilience.' This created an unnecessary and unproductive confusion and competition between two concepts that are complementary, mutually reinforcing and interdependent. In addition, 'resiliency' has become en vogue creating added confusion. With this background in mind this session will look at resilience and sustainability within the context of assessment, planning and projects on two campuses: The University of New Hampshire and MIT.",724,2697,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Air & Climate,Campus Engagement,,,,,resilience,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Tom Kelly,724,Executive Director Sustainability Institute/Chief Sustainability Officer,Brian Goldberg,2697,Sustainability Staff,Jennifer Andrews,724,Project Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8484/0915_Goldberg_0875.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8485/0915_Andrews_0875.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8483/0915_Kelly_0875.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8483/0915_Kelly_0875_1015_111856.pptx
Achieving SDG Targets: The European Approach: Compliance - The Case of Energy & Irish Universities,"Ireland, as a nation, has signed up to the SDGs. The main drivers in reaching these targets will be through a set of interventions that are encompassing - legislation - compliance to higher regulations - incentives - dissemination of effective best practice. When all put together, it is a large and complex tapestry of actions.  The presentation proposed will take Energy as an example. It will outline how the targets have been set nationally to achieve our internationally agreed targets. The resulting Irish approach will be highlighted, filtering down to what specific steps are taking place in the public sector. The resulting actions that are being implemented in the Irish University sector will be presented, with specific examples being provided from the actions taking place in the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT).  In short, Ireland has set a target for private organisations to achieve at 25% energy use reduction by 2020 over baseline measurements made by 2008. Public Sector bodies are to achieve a 33% reduction. Over the past 9 years DIT has had to make decisions that deliver on this target. The decision making has been assisted by a blanket of initiatives provided by central government encouraging sharing information, setting procurement requirements, upskilling key staff, establishing proven and robust frameworks, platforms for informing and educating 23,000 staff and students.

Projection and Scenario Analysis for Climate and Nitrogen Action Planning,"Campuses are now calculating their carbon and nitrogen footprints together in SIMAP, a web-based platform launched in fall 2017. Once you have calculated your campus' footprints, how might you use your results to develop an integrated climate and nitrogen action plan? We will explore this question through three parts of this session: case studies on current action plans, identification of strategies for integrated planning, and a preview of projections & solutions in SIMAP, the Sustainability Indicator Management and Analysis Platform. Part 1: Current action plans. We will first present two case studies on stand-alone footprint action plans: A climate resilience plan at the University of New Hampshire, and a nitrogen action plan at the University of Virginia. Part 2: Integrated planning. We will explore different strategies for combining a climate and nitrogen action plan into a single campus initiative. To inform these strategies, we will review and compare projection and scenario results for campus carbon and nitrogen footprints to demonstrate the overlap and co-benefits for a range of management strategies.

Colleges and universities can use this process to: Develop relationships with key stakeholders in their communities; Understand shared strengths and vulnerabilities across the campus and community in the context of climate-related hazards; Identify initial actions to increase resilience; Fulfill the requirement of completing an initial campus-community Resilience Assessment for the Presidents' Climate or Resilience Commitment. The training will walk participants through all steps of the CRB Workshop process, including: core team establishment; goal setting; defining top hazards (past, current, future); participatory mapping of strengths and vulnerabilities; development of actions against multiple hazards; and prioritizing solutions. Participants will leave prepared to organize CRB workshops with their respective campuses and communities. This training is relevant for campuses in all stages of the resilience assessment and planning process; the CRB can be used to kickstart the conversation around resilience or it can be used to further refine planning goals.",123,8315,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Air & Climate,Public Engagement,,,,,"resilience,planning,community engagement,workshops",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Ruby Woodside,123,Innovative Services Manager,Adam Whelchel,8315,Director of Science, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7809/1300_Whelchel_0219.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7808/1300_Woodside_0219.pdf,,
"Designing a Realistic, Challenging, and Effective Climate Action Plan: Options and Best Practices","This session will present the results of a research project aimed at understanding how institutions of higher education have developed and structured their Climate Action Plans. The goal of the session is to provide attendees with resources and insights that will help them to design a realistic, challenging, and effective Climate Action Plan (CAP). The research is centered on a comparative and systematic analysis of a set of Climate Action Plans, with the aim of understanding the various ways in which institutions have decided to structure their plans, in terms of organization, content, and format. By illuminating common features of these plans, the choices and options available to institutions, and best practices, the research is useful to any institution seeking to develop their own CAP. A second part of the research, based on both interviews and written materials, focuses on the processes and strategies used by colleges and universities to develop a CAP. During the session, attendees will be provided with an overview of the different strategies used by institutions to execute and structure their plans, as well as an analysis of how to determine and customize the best strategy for one's own institution. Attendees will also receive a handout with tools for making choices about a CAP. By contributing to efforts to develop Climate Action Plans, this session supports work by institutions to contribute to efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals 13, 11.",2951,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Air & Climate,Research,,,,,climate action plans,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Kenneth Foster,2951,"Chair, President's Sustainability Council",Josie Perhus,2951,Energy & Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intern, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8355/1400_Perhus_0730.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8355/1400_Perhus_0730.pdf,,
Three Zeros Environmental Initiative at UNC Chapel Hill: The Chancellor's Sustainability Charge,"The University of North Carolina (UNC) has set a new global standard for sustainability in higher education's constantly evolving environment. UNC is scaling its impact through the Three Zeros Environmental Initiative (TZEI)- net zero greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and landfill waste-a framework that is critical to its physical, operational, and community planning. Learn how the Chancellor's initiative is reinventing the great global public research university through sustainability and apply lessons learned at your institution. Through this session, the panelist aim to demonstrate how UNC: - builds road maps for achieving triple zero initiatives on campuses. - weaves the university-scale sustainability charges into capital building and planning projects. - embeds sustainability into your campus's DNA through engagement, awareness, and team building. - challenges conventional sustainability pathways with pan-campus initiatives to achieve a triple zero initiative. Throughout the UNC Chapel Hill Sustainability Plan and Three Zeros Environmental Initiative, community engagement was paramount. This session will not only demonstrate how the planning team engaged the community through a wide range of exercises, town halls, working groups and interviews, but aim to actually use this session to establish some fundamental themes in sustainability in our industry.",239,4238,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Air & Climate,Water,,,,,"sustainability plans,net zero water,zero waste,carbon neutrality",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Steven Baumgartner,239,SmithGroup,Amy Armbruster,4238,Outreach Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8136/0830_Baumgartner_0535.pdf,,,
Resiliency in the Face of Global Change: Developing a Sustainability Program That Thrives,"In December 2017, China announced a waste importing ban that upended the global recycling markets. In January 2018, the U.S. imposed a 30% tariff on solar equipment manufactured abroad. In 2017, super storms Harvey, Irma and Maria hit the southeastern United States, sending ripple effects through the conversation about climate disaster preparedness and federal emergency response. These global shocks have a direct effect on how sustainability offices and universities develop and implement sustainability initiatives and drive organizational change. They also provide opportunities for us to rethink and work towards broader, global systems change. How can we proactively prepare for these moments? What should we know about these changes and how will they affect our work? In this session, we will propose frameworks and brainstorm tactics that enable sustainability offices to be resilient and innovative in the face of changing global landscapes. This will include strategies for educating senior administration on the impacts of these events on campuses and strategies for leveraging shocks as moments of opportunity to generate investment in proactive, innovative systems.",788,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Air & Climate,,,,Sustainability Office,,"resilience,weather preparedness,disaster & emergency response",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Jenna Musco,788,Assistant Director,Rosi Kerr,788,Sustainability Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Extending Sustainability Practices to Tenant Spaces: Green Leasing at Portland State University,"Portland State University (PSU) is home to approximately 60 commercial tenants. Tenants range from food service and retail, to offices, banks, ATMs, and advertising. To encourage sustainability practices and behaviors among tenants and enable stronger adoption of University Technical Design Standards, PSU Campus Sustainability Office staff are working with stakeholders in Campus Planning, Facilities & Property Management, and Capital Projects & Construction to implement a green leasing program. To date, PSU's green leasing program has focused on capturing the newest tenants on campus by examining the LOI and lease negotiation process, as well as the tenant improvement (also known as the fit-out). Moving forward, PSU stakeholders also hope to ensure ongoing engagement and training with tenants, by collaboratively celebrating best practices and identifying areas for improvement. The program has been designed around a few key required measures, like alignment with University solid waste management policy, and additional encouraged measures, such as attainment of the City of Portland's Sustainability at Work certification. While green leasing is increasingly being used in the private sector, it is not common at higher education institutions. Therefore, this presentation will provide a brief overview of green leasing and how its application to higher education is similar to and different than in the private sector. This presentation will outline the program design at PSU.",2515,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,,,"on-campus collaboration,building occupants",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Emily Quinton,2515,Sustainability Education & Outreach Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8381/1400_Quinton_0771.pdf,,,

Leverage Key Facilities Metrics to Advance Sustainability - Survey Could be 'Gateway Drug' to STARS,"Most participants know that STARS is a holistic value laden intensive survey that has produced fantastic results and encouraged sustainability success from campuses. Overall, by reviewing and implementing the AASHE STARS program, a campus is likely to advance development of programs, improve operations, advance initiatives and relate better to community. However - not all campuses are willing to undertake the effort to complete STARS. For those campuses that cannot - APPA/NACUBO formulated a simple, six question survey to gather data on operations issues related to BTU/EUI, electrical, water, waste and carbon. For campuses that have already done AASHE STARS filling out this survey will be simple, and will assist in getting others to improve their baseline consumption. There is no cost to the survey, and a campus does not need to be a part of either APPA or NACUBO. In its fifth year, the survey has motivated many campuses that do not participate in any kind of sustainability survey. Results are that campuses can participate and leadership can work with the information to improve their own consumption and reduce physical operational costs. 'You cannot manage what is not measured' is an old, but true, adage. See results of how campus participating with the APPA//NACUBO Key Facilities Metrics and worked with leaders to reduce consumption.

Mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals: An Insiders' Account of change in a UK University,"Higher Education institutions have a crucial role to play in catalysing action to address the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The call to action that the Goals represent can be seen as aligning with universities' long-standing purpose to positively contribute to society via education, research and public engagement. However, successful take-up of this agenda within institutions is likely to rely upon a wide range of factors, including national/international pressures on the higher education sector and internal dynamics and agenda setting behaviours of staff, students and university leaders. This poster offers a contemporary empirical account of such factors from a UK university that has recently vigorously adopted the SDG agenda. The poster summarises key factors affecting how over 12 months the SDGs went from being relatively unknown within a UK university, to being the cornerstone of a new institutional strategy that aims to use the Goals as a prism to inform all of the institution's activities. Drawing upon literature on Transition Management and organisational change and insights from staff involved in teaching, research, campus sustainability and public engagement, the poster offers a view from the inside of how a strategic commitment and enhanced activities emerged via complementary top-down leadership and bottom-up initiatives. The analysis highlights a broadening of support for sustainable development and three key emerging tensions: between a reductionist and holistic framing of sustainable development; between working to achieve the SDGs and critical exploration of the concepts involved; and between marketing-oriented and impact-oriented intended outcomes of engagement. Through highlighting these issues in the context of a live and evolving situation at a UK university, the poster offers a timely summary of the challenges and opportunities inherent in mainstreaming sustainable development within the higher education sector.",353,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),organizational change",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Andrew Reeves,353,"Senior Lecturer, Institute of Energy and Sustainable Development", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10434/1430_Reeves_1106.pdf,,,
Latin Flavor in AASHE: Contributions to Sustainability Offices,"In many institutions of higher education and universities around the world, there are offices that manage the issue of sustainability for years. AASHE is a multicultural space where many of the people in charge of this topic meet annually in their institutions. In this conversation, we want to highlight the contribution made by some directors of sustainability offices with Latin roots, in institutions of the USA or Colombia, and as part of our heritage and essence can contribute significantly to the training of students and the operation of the institutions in which we work. To be American (that is, citizens of a country in America) is to have a mixture of languages, behaviors, traditions and values. From food to music, we want to highlight how the Latin flavor is contributing to the construction of sustainability in different universities, and in turn, learn from the other cultures that participate and are part of the AASHE world. We will mention the experiences in USA and Colombia: at the University of Texas in the Rio Grande Valley, Dallas County Community College District and the EAN University, but beyond that, the experiences from other Hispanic attendees to this session, will allow strengthening the link of work in sustainability to starting from the things that unite us as people.",5109,4271,3868,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,cultural & racial diversity,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Jose Martinez Sepulveda,5109,Sustainability Department Director,Maria Boccalandro,4271,Sustainable Communities Institute Director,Marianella Franklin,3868,Chief Sustainability Officer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10509/0915_MartinezSepulveda_0665.pdf,,,

Top Down and Bottom-Up: The Pitt Sustainability Planning Process,"In 2017 Pitt embarked on their first comprehensive sustainability plan which launched early this year. This session outlines the top-down approaches to connect with leadership and link this planning effort, and the implementation that follows, directly to the Plan for Pitt, the University's Strategic Plan. The presenters, through presentation and hands-on exercises, will demonstrate the 'bottom-up' engagement processes used to reach the campus community to inform and drive the plan. From the desk of the Chancellor: 'Long-term sustainability extends beyond environmental practices. It requires deep and lasting changes that will enable future generations to thrive in a world that is environmentally responsible, socially equitable and economically robust. It is a great challenge - one that our University's mission, which is to harness knowledge for society's gain, perfectly positions us to tackle. To advance this work, we established a University Sustainability Committee in the fall of 2016. These committee members set out to think boldly, develop goals and recommend supportive actions for promoting sustainable practices across the Pitt community. The result of their efforts - the Pitt Sustainability Plan - is a strategic framework that calls for dramatic improvements in sustainability across our University by 2030.'

How a Team of Student Ambassadors Can Amplify and Accelerate Wins for a Small Sustainability Staff,"Facing the Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals of campus sustainability work with small offices can feel impossible; however, despite having a small staff, college and university sustainability offices can effect real change on campus by leveraging student employees. CWRU's Office for Sustainability hired its first group of student employees in 2014. Known as Climate Leaders, this small group of students were tasked with creating presentations designed to educate our campus population on various sustainbliity-related information and delivering these presentations to 3 groups within their spheres of influence. The intention behind the program was amplifying the sustainability message from the University to the 16,000 students, staff, and faculty on campus who were not familiar with the work being done by our office of 2 staff members. 4 years later, and the CWRU Office for Sustainability now employs 16 Student Ambassadors, who work across the spectrum of sustainability topics on campus. Our Student Ambassadors now not only share and magnify the values, lessons, and work being done by the Office for Sustainability, but they are increasing the capacity of our still small office of 2 full time staff to accomplish sustainability projects on campus and accelerating the rate of sustainability change on campus. This session will share the lessons we have (sometimes painfully) learned as we honed the structure of our student employee program to be effective in meeting the SDG goals.",2958,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,"student engagement,internships,student ambassadors",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Erin Kollar,2958,Assistant Director of Sustainability, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
The Design Thinking Process: User-Centered Solutions to Complex and Confounding Problems,"Coming out of Stanford's Institute of Design, the Design Thinking (DT) framework has taken the Architecture, and now the business world, by storm. However, this solution- and user-focused design process is incredibly useful for sustainability professionals as we traverse complicated behavioral, institutional, and financial barriers in creating more just and sustainable campuses. For many, the process of creating solutions often starts with problems from our own point of view: our recycling rate is not high enough, our alternative transit numbers are not high enough, etc. While starting here can eventually lead to useful solutions, shifting your point of view can be incredibly useful in creating lasting, working solutions. The DT process, instead, begins with the needs of the user: how are they currently interacting with, say, your recycling program, and what are their needs around this topic? This forces us, the planners, to truly understand our problems, and therefore reach solutions that help our users, rather than ourselves. The Center for Sustainability at the University of Denver has used this process in a number of our planning processes, from assessing our student employment program, to re-writing our mission statement, to including sustainable elements in a new residence hall being built on campus.",2186,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,"planning,solutions focus",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Emily Schosid,2186,Sustainability Program Coordinator,Chad King,2186,Sustainability Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7736/1300_King_0135_1011_142215.pdf,,,

Using the Analytical Hierarchy Process to Perform a Materiality Study on the SDGs,"To effectively 'ignite change' in regards to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, a university must first determine which of them are applicable and material to the organization. This process helps ensure that the limited resources available for sustainability efforts are utilized in ways the stakeholders deem important. At Villanova University, applicability and materiality studies will be performed on the SDGs using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). AHP was developed by Saaty in the 1970's to facilitate large subjective decisions, which makes it perfect for determining the relative importance of the SDGs to an organization such as a university. AHP also makes it easy to incorporate the views of many diverse stakeholders. The process boils down a seemingly large decision into many simple and easy decisions to reduce overall stress on the decision makers. The final result is a weighted list of all the compared items, in this case UN SDG Targets. This prioritization of the UN Targets can facilitate the creation of Sustainability Strategic Plans around the most important targets. Future work will include the development of a scoring system for each UN Target, modeling of projects to determine the improvement they are expected to bring an organization's score, and a statistical cost benefit analysis of said projects. The net benefit of this combined work will be a qualitative determination of the 'optimal' way for each organization to spend their resources, customized to what they find most important in the SDGs. The methodology for completing a materiality study on the SDGs using AHP will be presented along with the Villanova results.",1718,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,,Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Matthew Ashcroft,1718,Graduate Student,Liesel Schwarz,1718,Sustainability Staff, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Institution Nitrogen Footprints in SIMAP: Updated Results and New Insights,"Seven campuses that participated in the development of the nitrogen footprint tool (NFT) published findings from their initial nitrogen footprint calculations in the April 2017 special issue of Sustainability: The Journal of Record. In October 2017, SIMAP was released by the UNH Sustainability Institute as a web-based tool for institutions to calculate carbon and nitrogen footprints simultaneously. Beyond the major contribution of combining carbon and nitrogen footprints, SIMAP included updates and improvements to nitrogen footprint calculation methods. Institutions that had previously used the excel-based NFT for assessing their nitrogen footprints have since uploaded their data inputs in SIMAP. In addition, several more institutions in the NFT Network have completed nitrogen footprint analyses using the new SIMAP tool. This presentation will cover a. the updated nitrogen and carbon footprint results from SIMAP, b. how the new results differ from the initial findings using the NFT, and c. an updated analysis of sustainability metrics using a larger sampling of institutions that have completed nitrogen footprint analyses. A deeper understanding of the results and sustainability metrics used for campus nitrogen footprints will inform sustainability planning and goal setting around nitrogen, and it will also contribute to our knowledge about how institutions can participate in addressing broad environmental issues.",4028,724,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,Research,,,,,"nitrogen,emissions reporting,SIMAP",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Elizabeth Milo,4028,Project Manager of the Nitrogen Footprint Network for Institutions,Allison Leach,724,PhD Candidate, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
"Resiliency: A Platform for Institutional Change, Case Study Cal State University San Bernardino","Historically, California State University San Bernardino (CSUSB) has embraced sustainability through faculty curriculum, students initiatives, and facilities management retrofitting projects, however, sustainability efforts are not coordinated and transformational change is still needed. Resiliency is of particular interest to the CSUSB campuses at San Bernardino and Palm Desert because of its geographical location, diverse campus population, economic and environmental challenges. To tackle this approach the CSUSB Office of Sustainability identified key metrics including energy, water, transportation and mobility, education and community, building and land use, and food and waste. CSUSB then developed working groups around these metrics that include faculty, staff, students, alumni, and regional partners to inform the plan and develop actionable strategies and resources to reach our goals. Finally the plan established a Task Force to coordinate the campus wide efforts, and to inform the President and Chancellor to ensure administrative support through financial and policy avenues. This project has re-energized the campus community around sustainability initiatives. CSUSB has been successful in bringing stakeholders together from across campus and community to develop our sustainability plan and to continue to vet sustainability initiatives. This work has created a more deliberate, coordinated approach to sustainability in campus operations, curriculum, and research opportunities that engage students, faculty and staff.

Abandoned Bikes on Campus: Redistribution and the Sustainable Development Goals,"Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in Richmond, VA and Eastern Mennonite University (EMU) in Harrisonburg, VA are presented with a number of bikes abandoned by students each year. As cycling gains popularity on campuses across the U.S., universities increasingly face this obstacle and must find ways to process these bikes. This session will explore how VCU and EMU recycle, refurbish and redistribute abandoned bicycles and how those methods relate to various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The presentation will cover two areas: Sustainable Communities and Good Health and Well-Being: Refurbishing bicycles and redistributing them within the university population furthers these SDGs. VCU refurbishes bikes for a semester long rental program that serves international students and a short term rental program for the larger student population. EMU similarly refurbishes bicycles for a semester long rental program available to all students on campus. Reducing Inequalities and Partnerships for the Goals: Redistribution of bicycles to populations outside the university contributes to meeting these SDGs. VCU partners with local non-profits to redistribute its abandoned bicycles to youth Earn-A-Bike programs in local middle and high schools. EMU has additional bikes refurbished that are then distributed to a local refugee resettlement program.",1546,7923,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,Transportation,,,,,"bikes,reuse",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Sera Erickson,1546,Bicycle Program Coordinator,Gregory Sachs,7923,Building Automation Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9256/1430_Erickson_0597.pdf,,,
"Imposters, Insiders, and Collaborators: Bringing Outside Expertise to the World of Sustainability","Sustainability is often viewed as a field reserved for those with expertise gained through an academic background in Environmental Science, Ecology, Sustainability or similar areas, and individuals from outside of those fields can feel they lack the credentials and the credibility that comes with it. In actuality, 61% of us come from a field or area of study considered to be outside of the core domains of sustainability. We bring with us expertise in business, public health, education, political science, the humanities, and dozens of other fields of study, and are key to creating robust, innovative and effective sustainability programs. We know that our most pressing global challenges cannot be solved by sustainability professionals alone. Creating tangible, significant progress toward the UN's diverse Sustainable Development Goals requires a robust set of experiences and knowledge bases that extend well beyond the sustainability-focused disciplines. This session features four current professionals in the field from different backgrounds and in varying positions within the sustainability umbrella to show how each of their unique areas of expertise have augmented the impact they are able to have on their campus.

It has proven to be a simple yet effective project management tool to bring about positive change throughout the Phoenix metropolitan area and beyond. The utilization of the VMOST² for designing and executing student-led business sustainability projects is unique to GreenLight and has proven to be very effective over the past five years. Whether you're by yourself or with a team, join us for an interactive workshop and engaging discussion. We believe that with proper organization and effective collaboration, we can catalyze passionate students to apply their classroom knowledge to real world challenges in order to create sustainable solutions that make a difference in the lives of others.",8418,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,,project management,10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Ryan Mores,8418,Operations Director,Ashley Weisman,8418,Internal Development Intern, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7782/1300_Mores_0202.pdf,,,
Leveraging the SDGs to Build a System-Wide Higher Education Sustainability Strategy,"Sixty-Four schools, nearly half a million enrolled students, 33,000 faculty and 96,000 degrees granted annually--the higher education scope and impact of the State University of New York system is vast and deep. This breadth and depth is a great asset but it can also be a challenge when thinking about a coordinated and integrated sustainability strategy across the different institutions--especially in a decentralized governing model. This session will focus on the challenges and opportunities of creating a campus to system (bottom up) sustainability strategy using the Global Goals or Sustainable Development Goals as a key organizing tool to find common ground and purpose across diverse intuitions. We will explore the process of forming a committee of campus sustainability professionals who lead the project, developing the strategy, the identification of the SDG's as a vehicle, the process of drafting university system specific targets and presenting those to the Chancellor for adoption. The session will also spend considerable time looking at why this initiative was undertaken and the inherent benefit it can provide for sustainability coordinators at the campus level as they work to achieve the grand challenges we collectively face.",1306,4319,1442,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),regional focus",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Ryan McPherson,1306,Chief Sustainability Officer,Mary Ellen Mallia,4319,Director of Sustainability,Dan DeZarn,1442,Director of Sustainability, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7860/1130_McPherson_0280.pptx,,,
Notre Dame's Success in Developing a Sustainability Strategy Aligned to SDGs and Its Mission,"In response to Pope Francis' 2015 encyclical Laudato si', the University of Notre Dame leadership championed a committee out of the Executive Vice President's office to take action. Using a participatory approach comprised of faculty, staff and undergraduate and graduate students, the committee was formed to not only review the current state of the University's sustainability efforts but also develop realistic actions and recommendations. As a result, the comprehensive sustainability strategy was developed, which called out specific five-year plans in six key areas of sustainability that are consistent with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. The long-term vision for the University to become a more sustainable campus was strengthened by identifying small working groups that would meet routinely to review progress and establish metrics in support of the key strategy areas: Energy and emissions Water Building and construction Waste Procurement, licensing and sourcing Education, research and community outreach This session will present a case of one institution's participatory approach to preparing and advancing a comprehensive sustainability strategy.

AASHE STARS: Field Notes From New Adopters,"The AASHE STARS program is invaluable. It provides higher education institutions a unified platform for assessing and reporting their contributions towards the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. However, obstacles remain. AASHE's 2015 membership survey results highlighted the primary barrier to ongoing participation in STARS: lack of time and resources to complete STARS. In response, AASHE's 2018-2020 Strategic Plan calls for a series of initiatives aimed at simplifying data collection, and making the reporting process more collaborative. This will culminate with the release of a simplified STARS 3.0 in 2020. In the interim, institutions remain eager to undertake the reporting process. This panel highlights the experience of two institutions working toward their first-ever STARS Report. The University of Chicago began their reporting effort in 2017, with a Readiness Assessment. The aim of this assessment was to establish inter-departmental data and information collection processes and build on existing strategic partnerships with senior administration and campus stakeholders. Case Western Reserve University has reported to Sierra Club and Princeton Review for several years. In 2017, the institution decided to pursue STARS reporting. Since then, the aim has been to verify historic inputs, and complete previously un-pursued credits. The panel will begin with a brief overview of the challenges first-time reporters face. Then, the panel will shift to discussing practical suggestions for efficiently 1) gaining institutional buy-in; 2) collecting data; 3) verifying accuracy; and 4) submitting reports.",2222,2054,2958,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"STARS,sustainability reporting",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Sophie Mason,2222,Account Manager,Sara Popenhagen,2054,Sustainability Staff,Cody Lorentson,2222,Sustainability Specialist,Stephanie Corbett,2958,Director Energy & Sustainability, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9032/1430_Lorentson_0344.pdf,,,
Mapping the Pathway to STARS Platinum,"AASHE's Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, and Rating System (STARS) is the leading North American green/sustainable campus rating system developed by colleges and universities for colleges and universities. STARS provides the foundation for other campus sustainability rankings and is quickly becoming the standard which peer institutions use to evaluate overall achievements and progress in sustainability. Completing STARS also requires investing considerable resources. With STARS providing a version of key performance indicators (KPIs) for higher education sustainability, and given the resource commitments necessary to complete a full and serious report, sustainability officers in the University of California system find that is critical to treat STARS as a strategic tool and leverage these reports to drive tangible changes. We will describe how we use our systemwide STARS/Metrics Coordination Working Group to coordinate on STARS and other common metrics reporting, align on external rankings issues, find opportunities for shared credits and streamlined reporting to reduce reporting burdens and resource load, and advocate for STARS as a strategic tool for UC campuses to drive change and add value. We will present UC Merced's and UC Santa Barbara's gap analyses, and share our findings and observations.

A Framework for Sustainability Competencies for Your Campus,"Last fall we published a study on competencies for sustainability, 'Developing a framework for sustainability meta-competencies,' based on interviews and focus groups with Penn State University employees serving in a wide range of functions in that institution. Our intention was to produce common terminology around sustainability that could easily be adopted and applied across university functions. Five sustainability meta-competencies resulted from the work: systems thinking, temporal thinking, interpersonal literacy, ethical literacy and imagination/creativity. This framework assumes that certain foundational competencies are in evidence, including logical thinking, critical thinking, quantitative analysis, reading and writing. This year, our study was named a finalist for the AASHE Campus Sustainability Research Award. Encouraged by this interest in the work, we present a summary of our findings as an invitation for conversation around the importance of these sustainability meta-competencies and their practical application on large and small campuses.",4190,4127,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,,competencies,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Lydia Vandenbergh,4190,Sustainability Staff,Susannah Barsom,4127,Associate Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10384/1430_Barsom_1101.pdf,,,
What is a Residence Life Sustainability Plan?,"The Department of Residence Life at Texas A&M operates as an auxiliary enterprise to provide student housing to approximately 12,000 students annually. Concurrent to the University's update to the campus-wide Sustainability Master Plan, the Department of Residence Life sought ways to evaluate its contribution to institution-wide sustainability efforts and prioritize future endeavors. Precedent research revealed very few examples of codified sustainability planning within housing and dining operations at peer institutions although many make positive contributions to university-wide efforts. Engaging with the outside consultant Ayers Saint Gross, the Department of Residence Life embarked on a 10-month process to evaluate the capacity of the department's built assets to support sustainable life skills education, determine the availability and efficiency of existing programming in teaching sustainable life skills, and how both its built environment and programming contribute to on-campus housing's competitive advantage in the College Station student housing market.",424,7982,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,Housing & Residence Life,,"sustainability plans,residence halls",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Allison Wilson,424,Sustainability Director,Carol Binzer,7982,Residence Life Staff, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8860/1430_Wilson_0112.pdf,,,
Integrating Social Equity: Texas A&M's 2018 Sustainability Master Plan,"Released in the Spring 2018 semester, Texas A&M's new Sustainability Master Plan has three primary objectives: to better integrate social equity objectives with environmental and economic efforts, to balance the need for long-term structure with short- and medium-term accountability, and to advance the institution's STARS performance. This planning effort, guided by external consultant Ayers Saint Gross, engaged a cross-section of over 460 students, faculty, and staff in an 11-month process to examine nine themes and develop context-specific goals, targets, and actions that will support Aggies in addressing sustainability more comprehensively. The plan highlights social sustainability as an independent subject of equal importance to efforts that address energy use, stormwater management, the built environment, and waste as well as institutional efforts such as curriculum, research, engagement, and administrative support. Join us as we share lessons learned in this case study about how a participatory-decision making process influenced this work's development, how this plan is being implemented to advance sustainability at Texas A&M, and the value of engaging an outside consultant in the process.",424,7982,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"sustainability plans,master plans,equity",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Allison Wilson,424,Sustainability Director,Kelly Wellman,7982,Sustainability Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7710/0830_Wilson_0111.pdf,,,

Preaching Beyond the Choir: How to Institutionalize Sustainability Into Organization-Wide Culture,"It is easy to get caught up in and become comfortable in a group that shares the same views. We know the people who have our back and who will help champion our missions and passions in life, but it is becoming increasingly challenging to reach across the aisle and communicate with the other side. This is especially true in sustainability when so many people are not purposefully exposed to these ideas in their day to day activities. It may seem like a simple idea to one individual, but to someone who has the opposite view on the situation, or someone who may not have a view at all, it may be more of a challenge to see the potential. The session will take a deep dive into strategies that have worked to integrate sustainability but also those that have failed, as we learn more from our failures in this space. We will highlight specific pilot programs and initiatives that skyrocketed engagement and participation among many groups on campus, not those just involved in sustainability or sustainability related issues. You will specifically hear and learn from a staff member at University of Washington Tacoma who lobbied for the schools' own Center for Leadership and Social Responsibility and another faculty member of Denison University who is the coordinator of the Office of Sustainability on their campus.

Go Green or Get Gone: Teachers College as a Case Study,"What is the role of graduate schools of education in the face of local and global environmental challenges? This session explores this question by presenting the development process and implementation of a strategic plan to enhance the engagement of Teachers College, Columbia University (TC) with sustainability practices and education. Over the past decade, TC supported several faculty initiatives to advance the cause of sustainability. Building upon these efforts and in 2015, the authors established a College-wide Working Group on Environmental and Sustainability Education (ESE). The group developed a three-part strategic plan. The first part was dedicated to crafting a shared definition for ESE. The group examined different definitions and synthesized them into a coherent and inclusive statement that has, in addition to an environmental focus, social equity, inclusion and holistic development. The second part focused on better understanding the mechanisms through which TC can engage in ESE efforts across multiple facets, from facilities to curriculum to research. The group hosted four public roundtables, analyzed survey data from current students, conducted a curriculum mapping of courses relevant to ESE, and identified the need for degree and non-degree programs. The third part, currently ongoing, is dedicated to engaging the NYC's public school system, among the largest in the world. The group is collaborating with the NYC-DOE Office of Sustainability on research and professional development. The group also developed a mentoring program for schools that serve low-income communities and have expressed interest in creating a student green team. In particular, this presentation will describe the process and implementation of our strategic plan, as well as and plans for future for how our inclusive definition of ESE can be woven across the fabric of Teachers College.

Sustainability Goal Setting at Universities: A Nitrogen Action Plan at the University of Virginia,"A nitrogen (N) footprint is the amount of reactive N released to the environment as a result of an entities' resource use. In 2010, the University of Virginia (UVA) became the first institution to establish an N footprint reduction goal. That goal is to reduce the University's N footprint 25 percent below the 2010 baseline N footprint, by the year 2025. Reaching a 25 percent N footprint reduction at a large, growing university is a challenge. In 2010, Allison Leach and James Galloway, built a Microsoft Excel-based module for calculating an institution N footprint. The development of this tool led to a partnership between UVA and the EPA to develop the Nitrogen Footprint Tool (NFT) Network. The NFT Network is comprised of 21 institutions who have used the N footprint module to calculate, assess, and plan reductions for their campus' N footprint. Hundreds of institutions now have the ability to calculate their N footprints through the Sustainability Indicators Management and Analysis Platform (SIMAP) launched in November 2017. Similarly to UVA, these institutions are faced with the challenge of reducing environmental impacts while growing in population. The main focus of this session will be to discuss feasible ways institutions can set and meet N footprint reduction goals. This session will highlight the development of UVA's Nitrogen Action Plan which outlines the University's proposed N reduction strategies it will implement to meet its goal. The Nitrogen Action Plan was developed alongside the University's Greenhouse Gas Action Plan, Sustainable Food Action Plan, and Materials and Waste Action Plan, among others. Each of these other action plans describes at least one strategies, such as increasing vegetarian meals purchased or investing in utility-scale solar fields, that can also claim N co-benefits. The session will feature a panel of representatives from UVA's Nitrogen Working Group and Office for Sustainability.",4028,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Air & Climate,Food & Dining,,,,,"nitrogen,nitrogen footprint,planning",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Elizabeth Milo,4028,Project Manager of the Nitrogen Footprint Network for Institutions,Andrea Trimble,4028,Sustainability Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8999/1430_Milo_0292.pdf,,,
Developing an Energy Strategy for Sustainability to meet Climate Action Planning Goals,"As ideas related to sustainability continue to grow on college campuses, college administrators and facilities directors look to develop plans that align campus infrastructure and facilities to fulfill sustainability goals. Lafayette College sought a map to meet upcoming emissions reductions targets and ultimately to become carbon neutral. To support this goal, the College partnered with The Stone House Group, a facilities and energy management consulting firm, to develop a comprehensive Energy Strategy for Sustainability that will ensure the campus has reliable, safe, sustainable, and cost-effective energy infrastructure to support the College's educational mission. Successful stewardship for a campus' facilities is a complex management challenge that requires a comprehensive approach to ensure the College's facilities align with its mission. Although each study is a distinctive process, great synergies exist between them whereby information collected in one study will feed into another study, ultimately creating an integrated energy strategy tailored to Lafayette College's goals, existing conditions, and opportunities. This method yields the ability for facilities directors to make informed decisions about sustainability and resiliency on their campuses, and also provides an economy over using a fragmentary approach. Our multi-faceted, holistic approach consists of: - Participation in the College's Climate Action Plan Committee; Student Engagement; ASHRAE Level 1.5 Energy Audits; ASHRAE Level 3 Energy Audits; Carbon Reduction Strategy; Energy Capital Investment Plan; Utility Master Plan. We will discuss how each study contributed to the overall energy strategy and what best practices were used and learned throughout the process.",7849,1196,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Energy,,,,,,"climate action plans,energy audits",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Larry Eighmy,7849,Managing Principal,Marie Fechik-Kirk,1196,Director of Sustainability, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9061/1430_Eighmy_0374.pdf,,,
The Power of Process: Thoughtful Engagement for Successful Projects,"You probably know best practices in, say, composting. Maybe you have researched the best compost haulers, how composting food can reduce GHG emissions, and how it saves water and energy. But what if your expertise doesn't lead to a successful program? What if no one joins you for the ride? This is where engaging everyone, including (maybe especially) your critics, comes in. This session provides an overview as to why creating a thoughtful and engaging planning process is more important than the program itself. With the launch of a campus-wide compost program as a case study, the audience will learn about the steps a major university took to engage all key stakeholders to create a unified compost rollout process that had the buy-in from dining services and custodial staff. This session will cover questions such as: How do you scale up a pilot program? Why it is important to bring your harshest critics to the table when mapping out your plan? How do you effectively use the collective wisdom of the group and develop a program that has staying power? Using campus composting as a case study, participants will learn how meetings were designed to solicit group wisdom, unearth potential barriers to the program's success, and create a space that encouraged critique without fear of escalation into infighting. Finally, participants will walk away with lessons learned, what challenges the groups learned to embrace, and which challenges they were able to overcome.",5968,4390,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Food & Dining,Waste,,,,,"compost,planning",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Dallase Scott,5968,Director of Change Management,Jessica Berry,4390,"Director, Office of Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
The Role of Private Sector Partnership in Sustainable Higher Education Operations & Education,"Throughout the American University in Cairo's 100-year history, we have strived to be leaders in all we do. Recently, that mission has been applied to sustainability. AUC has implemented meaningful changes that make campus operations more sustainable, but as a globally-oriented university, we always seek to engage with external partners. AUC is a member of the United Nations Global Compact, a network aimed at mainstreaming Sustainable Development Goals in the private sector and the world's largest corporate sustainability initiative. As part of UNGC's Egypt office, AUC has participated in trainings and networked with various Egyptian businesses. Additionally, AUC's School of Business was the first home of the UN's Middle East chapter of Principles for Responsible Management Education, which aims to introduce sustainability and SDGs to business education. Both initiatives have helped AUC's Office of Sustainability move beyond its traditional portfolio of water, energy, and waste to embrace a holistic, SDG-aligned approach to sustainability. AUC's engagement with UNGC and PRME is a case study of how university-private sector partnerships enable sharing best practices and enhance campus sustainability. This approach has been especially critical in Egypt, where public sector and NGO based sustainability initiatives are neither well established nor highly effective and where AUC does not have a large network of peer institutions.",7331,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Public Engagement,,"Business, Management, & Finance",,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),Principles for Responsible Management Education,UN Global Compact",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Yasmin Mahmoud,7331,Sustainability Officer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8038/1400_Mahmoud_0454_1016_072002.pdf,,,
Incorporating Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into Collaborative Sustainability Planning,"Ohio University is proud to have an ambitious and community-created Sustainability Plan, and to reside in a community that values sustainability. Both the City of Athens and Athens County have active sustainability plans, and several local businesses, such as the local hospital, OhioHealth O'Bleness, do as well. However, the goals of the SDGs are even more ambitious than these local sustainability plans - and are so broad that incorporation of SDGs into individual sustainability plans alone is not enough to successfully reach the goals. Successful achievement of goals and targets will only occur when approached synergistically by multiple organizations within a community or region. Ohio University will be restructuring its sustainability efforts into new engagement ecosystems or Sustainability Hubs, to catalyze these synergies. This poster shows how various SDGs could be synergistically incorporated into multiple local sustainability plans to frame and accelerate progress toward sustainability targets.

"Global Priorities, Educated Solutions: the Role of Academia in Advancing the SDGs","In 2015, the Office of Sustainability created a project aimed at understanding how Yale's teaching and research aligns with the SDGs, with the purposes of: (i) identifying pathways for collaboration between disciplines; (ii) providing a rationale for thinking of higher education sustainability beyond operational commitments; (iii) identifying the expertise Yale might lend to the process of achieving the SDGs. Data has been collected on over 3,000 Yale faculty members. Results show that every department at Yale has at least one faculty member whose scholarship relates to the SDGs, and Yale's scholarship touches each SDG. The university is using this data to foster collaboration between faculty with shared interests. Paralleling the internal effort, Yale has been leading an initiative through the International Alliance of Research Universities to explore the role of universities in advancing the SDGs. In June 2018, IARU will host a half-day event during the International Sustainable Campus Network annual conference in Stockholm. This program will be divided into four themes: (i) Scholarship for solutions: teaching and research in the context of the SDGs. (ii) Walking the talk: how campuses can lead by example in terms of operational excellence and using the campus as a test bed for innovation.

Case Study Revisited: Confirming how to Achieve Progressive Campus Sustainability Measures,"A decade has passed since previous qualitative research was collected and evaluated to determine how three campuses achieved progressive measures of environmental sustainability. The findings of this comparative case study were considered when evaluating how South Dakota State University underwent change to move towards progressive sustainability actions. A number of individual case studies describing what certain institutions have done could be found; however, limited research existed to examine how institutions achieved their green success. The original research compared progressive measures of sustainability based on six aspects of sustainability that emerged in the literature review: green campus operation measures; campus administration, organization, and leadership; teaching, research, and service; campus wide actions and activities; institutional assessment of campus sustainability measures; and how each campus overcame barriers (James & Card, 2012). Using the same six identified categories of evaluation and the findings therein, South Dakota State University was recently examined and confirmed these findings. With respect to the role of higher education in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), institutions can make a significant impact in promoting a sustainable future. 'Few, if any, sectors of American society are better positioned than U.S. higher education - and perhaps none face the moral imperative - to lead on issues of environmental performance and sustainability' (McIntosh, Gaalswyk, Keniry, & Eagan ,2008, p. 4).

Sustainability in the C-Suite: Preliminary Study Results,"Sustainability can be a strategic driver when the function is included at the highest level of an organization. What are the most innovative leaders in higher education, business, and government doing to ensure that sustainability is integrated at the highest level of strategy and decision making? Professionals and graduate students from three institutions and two businesses have come together to find answers to this question. Conversations on leadership in sustainability from AASHE 2017 inspired this study that is plumbing the minds of college presidents, CEOs, professional recruiters, and senior professionals across the country through interviews and surveys. This presentation will reveal preliminary findings and reflections upon answers to questions such as: - How does a sustainability philosophy manifest in executive-level decision-making? - What are the compelling factors that motivate CEOS/Presidents to establish the positions? - What are senior leaders' perceptions of sustainability professionals? What are the perceptions of sustainability professionals? - What are the key pathways to including sustainability at the C-suite level ? - What are the actual structures (job descriptions, reporting structures, etc.) that allow it to manifest? - How do sustainability leaders use their backgrounds and philosophy to influence executive-level decision making? - There has been a spike in growth in the field over the past ten years - but it has recently plateaued.",769,3879,8618,5968,,,,Coordination & Planning,,,,,President or Chancellor's Office,,"sustainability officers,leadership,executives",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Jennifer deHart,769,Chief Sustainability Officer,Aurora Winslade,3879,Director of Sustainability,Andrew Evans,8618,Managing Director,Dallase Scott,5968,Director of Change Management, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

Strategies for an Actionable Sustainability Plan: Tools and Lessons Learned From the Field,"A common institutional challenge is to find an appropriate process for developing or revisiting strategic plans to advance sustainability, resilience, and climate action. Though a one-size-fits-all model has not emerged, there are highly replicable tools and approaches that can be borrowed and then adapted to each campus context. Representatives from American University, Santa Clara University, and the University of North Carolina Charlotte will speak to their recently completed planning processes, laying out process and goals, highlighting tools used, and sharing lessons learned from unique planning efforts. These institutions are at different stages of maturity in sustainability achievements, but their planning efforts held common challenges of establishing foundational values ('why'), expanding scope ('what'), and supporting implementation partners ('how'). American University is conducting resilience planning through an assessment workshop and the creation of an accountability structure built through consensus. Santa Clara University is updating a climate action plan into a strategic sustainability plan that provides tools like roadmaps, playbooks and metric-tracking. UNC Charlotte used compliance with university policies to frame a sustainability plan to address 3 strategic initiatives and their carbon commitment.

The goal of this program was to capture student enthusiasm for sustainability while demonstrating that EcoReps could successfully execute campus wide programming. Throughout the semester, topics in all aspects of sustainability were covered. The workshop series was well accepted by students and people in the community. Each attendee completed a feedback form that will be used in future development of the program. This workshop series was an intrical part of EcoReps receiving funding from the university in May of 2018.

Using STARS reporting as a framework for a modular campus sustainability plan,"Creating a campus sustainability plan can be a daunting and complex task. In addition, limited staff and financial resources may also be barriers to creating a robust sustainability plan. The University of Washington is working on a comprehensive campus sustainability plan that will develop and implement modules of a larger plan individually rather than producing the entire plan all at once. To identify the modules, we began by using the four main categories of STARS. We then consolidated related topics to a smaller list of 12 sections, further broken into 20 module plans that would need to be developed based on the distinctness of the topics and the subject matter experts that would be engaged to create the module plan. For example, 'Academics' and 'Research' is one section but will actually be two distinct module plans. This modular planning process allows the sustainability office to work on pieces of the overall sustainability plan as resources are available, culminating in a comprehensive plan. This presentation will outline the process UW went through to identify areas for the sustainability plan, as well as the planning tools and resources the UW Sustainability office has used to lead the process.",4030,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,,"STARS,sustainability plans",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Daimon Eklund,4030,Sustainability Communications Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9552/1430_Eklund_0917.pdf,,,
Teach Environmental Sustainability via Children's Literature,"We propose to share methods of integration into curriculum and resources for teacher-educators to reach their students, starting with elementary students and continuing on up the grades, K-12. Because children's literature conveys information in the highly appealing and memorable form of storytelling, we propose to share the curricula that our team of faculty and students have developed over the past seven years. In particular, we wish to share our ever-growing list of book titles that have proved effective at conveying the principles of environmental sustainability. Our purpose is to share our sustainability curriculum and book list with teacher-educators, so that they can put these materials to immediate use, without having to start from scratch. Since 2012, nearly 800 students (elementary education majors and speech language pathologist majors) from the University of Wisconsin, River Falls have undertaken to create this curriculum to use in the schools where they would teach. Each student chose a sustainability topic and located Web resources and children's books to support the topic. They created lesson plans from scratch, and made certain that these plans would accommodate: Formative assessments Different kinds of learning styles Appeal to varying age-groups of students. In addition, to inspire their students, they integrated information about sustainable environmental projects all along the St. Croix River, which serves as the geographical boundary between Minnesota and Wisconsin. By now, our curriculum and booklist has been put to use in the classroom by hundreds of teachers, not only via our own graduates, but via the other teacher-educators in the schools where our graduates teach. The curriculum and booklist are simple, easy to put into practice, and by now these materials have reached thousands of students in our region.",508,,,,,,,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,Education,Humanities (except languages),,,"teacher education,k-12",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Florence Monsour,508,Professor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Mindful Unbuilding: A Zero Waste Campus-Community Adventure,"What does a university do with a vacant old house that cannot be restored? Ordinarily: bulldoze it and haul it away to a landfill. But what if you were to take it apart, piece by piece, discovering what it's made of, where those materials came from, what secrets they keep, what stories they could tell, and what value they might still hold? In this presentation, we recount the two-year sequence of courses through which students, faculty, facilities staff, and community members worked together to deconstruct the house situated next to DePauw's campus farm, seeking to maximize not only the materials that could be salvaged for reuse and recycling, but also the educational potential embedded in the structure. We studied the ways places, houses, and objects can matter to people; apprenticed in the green art of rescuing, revitalizing and reusing building materials; and explored scientific research, scholarship, and creative works that reconceive the stuff we produce, consume, and throw 'away.' Mindful unbuilding taught us to look deeply into physical materials themselves - where they come from, where they go, and how they fit into the global materials economy. It taught us a great deal about the physical construction of buildings as well as the tools and techniques of deconstruction. Perhaps most importantly, it taught us to recognize this house as more than the sum of its material parts - as a hitherto Home, for People of character in our community, with a History, in a Place. Since all universities engage in renovation projects and increasingly look to deconstruction as an alternative to demolition, we seek to inspire creative high-impact collaborations that connect the liberal arts curriculum with the built environment, building a shared, 'concrete' understanding of the social dimensions of sustainability - helping us to reclaim the value of people and places as well as things.",8042,,,,,,,Curriculum,Buildings,Waste,,,,,"zero waste,deconstruction,reuse",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jennifer Everett,8042,Environmental Fellows Program Co-Director,James Mills,8042,Professor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9461/1430_Mills_0804.pptx,,,
Re-Design Certificate: Regenerative Ecological Design,"United Nations Environmental Program has claimed that our planet is amid its sixth major extinction of biological diversity. U.N. scientists estimate that 150-200 species become extinct every 24 hours. The leading cause of species decline is loss or contamination of native habitats. Current building patterns co-opt land and turn diverse ecosystems into anthropocentric monoculture, at roughly the rate of 2 million acres of U.S. open space per year. The need for continual growth is unavoidable, especially in the face of human relocation due to climate change. However, there are techniques that can be applied to reduce impact. While preserving land is important, it is not enough to offset the rate of growth and only increases the disconnect between humans and nature. Anthropocentric built environments are destroying native ecosystems at an alarming rate, this decline is just one of many issues that can be addressed through such problem-solving tools as systems dynamics science and ecological design thinking taught at the Ecosa Institute for Ecological Design. Our curriculum at the Ecosa Institute challenge the concept of built environments in conflict with nature and launched a new design revolution. Our curriculum is beyond interdisciplinary, its multi-disciplinary and cyclical in its nature. Our students are; architects, engineers, city planners, restoration scientist, and designers, who design for multiple species using a system's approach wherein biological diversity is enhanced, and resources are created instead of extracted. Our Design Strategy begins with ecology, biology, hydrology, and climatology evolving into an architectural and engineering design process to produce buildings that mimic and regenerate natural environments instead of degrading or compromising them. Our ultimate design challenge is to design a campus that serve the needs of humans and nature alike.",2364,,,,,,,Curriculum,Buildings,,Design,Architecture,,,"ecosystems,nature,built environment,regenerative",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jessica Hernreich,2364,"Executive Director, C.E.O.", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10441/1430_Hernreich_1110.pdf,,,

Demonstrating Impact Through SDG Cases - Creating Common Language and Shared Purpose Across Campus,"The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) exist as a Global platform for taking action to achieve sustainable development. The SDGs recognize that staying within our planetary boundaries and achieving sustainable development requires global effort by civil society, from all governments, and across all business sectors. Universities and private institutions around the world now find themselves facing a similar challenge, which is to identify how to apply the SDGs. To address this challenge, cross-border partnerships are being formed between universities and private organizations, combining innovation and knowledge resources to achieve sustainable impact. This session will demonstrate how the Danish consultancy company DEM has collaborated with universities including Aarhus University, Denmark, and the Harvard Office for Sustainability to develop SDG Cases for strategy planning and food standards. Each of these cases is connected by a common, replicable methodology, which lies in identifying SMART indicators (KPIs). Once these measurable indicators are in place, they are linked to specific Sustainable Development Goals and SDG Targets, so that impact can be tracked over time. This session will cover the benefits that can be achieved by university faculty, students and organizations applying this methodology to their work with the SDGs. This session will also cover a range of opportunities that exist for forming multi-stakeholder partnerships. Outcomes of this type of collaboration include raising awareness about sustainable development, generating new ideas for sustainability initiatives and their measurement, and reaching a broad range of stakeholders with a common language and shared purpose provided by the Global Goals.",8218,4451,,,,,,Curriculum,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),case based learning,performance indicators",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Heather Madsen,8218,Strategy & Organizational Sustainability Consultant,Angela Shields,4451,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10000/1400_Madsen_0376.pdf,,,
AIM2Flourish: Transforming Management Education Through Positive Business Innovation Stories,"The UN Global Goals are the 'World's Must-Do List' to end poverty, combat climate change, protect life on land, and ensure a livable future for all people.

From Theory to Practice: Applied Community Projects in Environmental Capstone Courses,"Over the past five years, Environmental Studies and Environmental Sustainability seniors at Earlham College have completed an 'integrated research project (IRP)' in collaboration with a community partner. The IRP is part of the requirements of these students' Senior Capstone Course and is a team project designed to integrate approaches from the many disciplines that contribute to Environmental Studies. In most years, the students have partnered with a department within the City of Richmond, Indiana, on this project. Projects have varied in focus, including a plan to rejuvenate the local Farmers' Market, an evaluation of neighborhood revitalization efforts, design of and fundraising for a sensory playground, and development of a revitalization plan for a reservoir. These projects offer students the opportunity to put into practice many of the concepts they have learned about throughout their college careers while also offering a deliverable product to the community partner. Learning moves from the classroom to the real world, allowing students to make a difference in the local community and to consider their role, as temporary residents of Richmond, in helping to promote community well-being and sustainability.

Uniting Human Rights and Sustainability Across the University,"The United Nations Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are a powerful framework for alleviating human suffering and achieving social and environmental justice. However, making progress on the the SDGs requires robust, multifaceted collaborations across many disciplines or issue areas and such interdisciplinary collaborations are rare. We believe our experiences show that breaking down the divisions between human rights, sustainability, social justice, procurement, environmental, fair trade, and other issue areas can yield very powerful, positive results. Such holistic, inclusive, collaborative thinking and acting is required if we want to accomplish systemic change. The University of Dayton (UD) has identified combining Sustainability and Human Rights as a major strategic priority. A member of the UN Global Compact, the university is committed to fair, ethical, and sustainable sourcing, education, scholarship, and community development. For twenty years, UD has been engaged in human rights education, research, and advocacy. A key component of that work has been working against human trafficking and forced labor. More recently, the university has broadened its focus to include issues of sustainability--including a divestment from all fossil fuel-based holdings.

From the 3Es to the SDGs: Updating Sustainability Frameworks Used as Educational Tools,"With the 2015 announcement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Climate Agreement, and the multitude of research projects, policies, and frameworks of Sustainable Development created as a result in the past three years, there is an urgent need for higher education sustainability to update its common educational tools to better reflect these recent innovations. Students coming of age now, and the professionals who work with and teach them, must all become more fluent in this new language of sustainability at the global and local scales. The 3Es, pillars, or legs of sustainability; the triple-bottom line; and the overlapping circles or nested dependencies of sustainability are all exemplary models of simplicity and mnemonic devices. But there is value in considering whether they satisfactorily capture all that they should. Does it really make sense to identify only three or so aspects of sustainability when there are now 17 SDGs? How can we succinctly capture so many diverse aspects of our shared vision for our planet into one, introductory model? The onus falls on faculty and staff in higher education to develop such a model(s). In this panel, we hope to provide instruction on several early-stage efforts that draw on both the SDGs and the concept of planetary boundaries.

"Pursuing the SDGs in Education Abroad: Tools, Techniques, and Assessment Strategies","Well-designed education abroad programs expose students to the many ways other cultures prioritize and pursue the UN SDG's. Foreign approaches to sustainability, biodiversity, and social justice reveal to students abroad the culturally distinct skills, attitudes and behavioral habits that can be experienced, assimilated, assessed and--more importantly--transferred back home. How do we design programs that go beyond cultural learning and help students experience--through comparative approaches to implementing the SDGs--how other people live lives far more sustainable than theirs? How do we situate sustainability literacy within cross-cultural contexts and use assessment instruments like the culturally adaptable Sulitest to measure attitudinal and behavioral change both within and across cultures. This session highlights tools and techniques for advancing the SDGs through study abroad. Session learning outcomes include: Recognize that the mission of study abroad must include student learning outcomes related to the SDGs. Appreciate the urgency with which educators abroad should regard sustainable behavior as a critical learning outcome of study abroad.

These impact have disproportionately impacted people of color and lower socioeconomic classes. Green and sustainable chemistry principles and practices aim to train chemists to use life cycle or systems thinking to reduce waste and increase resource efficiency in the development of chemicals and chemical processes. Is it implicit that green chemistry supports our definitions of equity and environmental justice, where all people have the right to live, work, play and learn in healthy, safe environments? The goals of this presentation are to identify ways chemists can partner with other stakeholders to advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Chemists will be critical partners in many of the SDGs, including: SDG 4 (advancing quality education); SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation); SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy); SDG 8 (decent work & economic growth); SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure); SDG 10 (reduced inequalities); SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production); SDG 13 (climate action).",4208,7562,,,,,,Curriculum,Diversity & Affordability,Research,"Physical & Earth Sciences (Chemistry, Geology, Atmospheric Sciences, etc)",,,,"green chemistry,equity,environmental justice,Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Edward Brush,4208,Professor,Jennifer MacKellar,7562,"Program Manager, Green Chemistry Institute", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
The Sustainability Exchange at Washington University - Interdisciplinary Focus on Real World Issues,"The Sustainability Exchange, founded in 2014 by Bill Lowry and Liz Kramer, brings together students from across the academic spectrum to focus on and seek solutions to real world issues and projects. Potential projects are proposed during registration for the upcoming semester and students self-select depending on their interest and expertise. The number of projects activated depends on the number of students that enroll. The innovation that underlies the Sustainability Exchange is bringing students together that don't normally get a chance to interact academically. The course itself has two parts, the first part provides students with critical creative problem-solving tools, collaboration models and sustainability philosophy; the second part has the students apply these tools to typically 5 focused real world projects or barriers. Each project focus group is comprised of 4-5 students and 1 to 2 professors/advisors/clients. As the problem statements are open-ended and have not necessarily been 'solved', the students are challenged to creatively utilize each other's expertise and collaborate on a sustainable solution. The students themselves chart the direction of the class and their advisors/professors/clients help them achieve their goals without directing them to a solution, a process that can be quite unnerving for certain types of students.",1977,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,Research,,,,,"interdisciplinarity,experiential learning,solutions focus",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Daniel Hellmuth,1977,Principal, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8082/1445_Hellmuth_0507.pdf,,,
How to Create an Innovative and Interdisciplinary Sustainability Major,"This case study examines several innovative degree programs that create unusual disciplinary alliances with sustainability. Integrating sustainability across the curriculum is an important goal for AASHE members. While many universities have developed interdisciplinary sustainability majors or minors affiliated with Environmental Sciences, a broadening to non-traditional partners is underway. For instance, as a way to locate sustainability within the larger globalization discourse, the University of Virginia introduced an undergraduate major in Global Environments + Sustainability. This program joins three interdisciplinary Global Studies programs in Public Health, Development Studies, and Security & Justice. As Director of that program, the presenter will discuss the conceptual framework, curriculum and implementation process of this complex partnership between six academic units. The session will also examine interdisciplinary sustainability programs in Bioethics, Entrepreneurship, Environmental Design, Food Science and Fashion Design. Columbia University has launched a unique Master of Science program in Bioethics & Sustainability Management, while the University of Vermont offers an innovative MBA in Sustainable Entrepreneurship. Session participants will be encouraged to imagine new possibilities for their schools, while examining the challenges and opportunities for creating innovative interdisciplinary sustainability degree programs across the country and globally.",4028,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,Sustainability Studies & Science,,,,"degree programs,interdisciplinarity",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Phoebe Crisman,4028,"Professor/Director, Global Environments + Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8269/1045_Crisman_0649.pdf,,,
Escaping the Silos and Generating Collaborations: A Sustainable Faculty Development Program,"The Faculty Affiliates Program gives faculty from all departments on our campus opportunities to meet monthly during the academic year to share ideas, generate resources and foster interdisciplinary connections throughout the university. This program fosters collaboration through these monthly meetings as well as through the network created by the program, and its associated interdisciplinary annual faculty grant program. This program's unique aim to provide connections between disciplines, research, and faculty across the university gives it a value that is not often found in higher education where siloed departments are the norm. In its 10th year, the program has had the opportunity to prove its worth and mature into long term sustainability. The program is run by the David E. Shi Center for Sustainability, a first of its kind academic department that leverages the strengths of a liberal arts institution by serving all faculty, all students, and all academic departments within the university. We serve as an animation hub which facilitates inter- and trans-disciplinary learning and research through the lens of sustainability. The Faculty Affiliates Program joins a suite of programs that cater to faculty, staff, students, and our community. This presentation will detail the naissance and history of the program, delineate the program's components, and describe the benefits and challenges of the program. This information will provide the spark to inspire participants to seek possibilities for their home institutions.

A New Resource To Engage Your Chemistry Department In Sustainability,"Despite the underlying fundamental reliance on chemistry innovations for a more sustainable future, undergraduate chemistry teaching laboratories still use traditional experiments that are resource-intensive and employ hazardous reagents. It is imperative that we educate the next generation of scientists to design experiments with sustainability in mind. It is also critical to the sustainability goals of most campuses that the environmental impact of laboratories is reduced. The recently released 'A Guide to Green Chemistry Experiments for Undergraduate Organic Chemistry Labs' seeks to address these concerns by providing educators with a set of safer, greener alternative organic chemistry experiments to demonstrate key transformations to undergraduate chemistry students. This presentation will focus on how to use the guide to engage the chemistry department in campus sustainability efforts, and will elaborate on ways it can assist campuses in meeting their sustainability goals.",7596,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,Waste,"Physical & Earth Sciences (Chemistry, Geology, Atmospheric Sciences, etc)",,,,"green chemistry,chemistry",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Derrick Ward,7596,Program Manager,Amy Cannon,7596,Executive Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10044/1430_Ward_0377.pdf,,,
Pulling the Paradox of the SDGs down to Uneven Ground: A Transdisciplinary Learning Journey,"Advocates of the Sustainable Development Goals see them as an important improvement over the Millennium Development Goals, that expired in 2015, that represent an inspiring and inclusive framework for international collective action over the next twelve years: The SDGs are universal: they apply to everyone, all countries, and they are intended to alter underlying conditions that violate the principles of sustainability, and not just respond to symptoms. But for others, the SDGs represent an instance of top-down planning efforts that 'shows what happens when a bureaucratic process runs out of control;' a naïve wish list of 'unactionable, unquantifiable, and unattainable' goals and targets. And in between are those that say the SDGs are ok as far as they go, but are undermined by glaring omissions and gaps with potentially destructive implications; or that while they are far from perfect, they reflect a core principle of inclusivity that is central to their value as an integrated system of goals going forward. If higher education is to clarify its role or roles in achieving the SDGs, we will have to actively embrace divergent views of what the SDGs are and what they represent, including a range of alternative and conflicting futures that they implicate. We will have to call on a kind of paradoxical intelligence that can hold opposing truths and navigate ambiguity as we manage uncertainty and disagreement; and we will need to cultivate practical wisdom through learning.",724,3995,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),transdisciplinarity",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Tom Kelly,724,Executive Director Sustainability Institute/Chief Sustainability Officer,Maria Alessandra Woolson,3995,"Affiliate GUND institute for Environment, Lecturer Honors College and Romance Lang. & Linguistics", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Building on the NAE Grand Challenges Scholars Model to Incorporate the UN SDGs in Higher Education,"As sustainability becomes a more and more popular addition in the higher education system, attempts to incorporate it into existing curricula and campus life diversify and too often lose their efficiency and purpose. Students become overwhelmed by the options and the myriad of overlapping missions. There is a growing need for a unifying program under which interested personnel could come to and relate their ideas. Recognizing this need, Bucknell University is exploring the incorporation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals into academic endeavors by building on the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges Scholars Program. By matching the Sustainable Development Goals with corresponding NAE Grand Challenges, the efforts to integrate sustainability into the higher education system could become more synchronized and thus more effective. Although the goals may not match up completely, they provide a broad platform for which universities and colleges can consider meaning and take action upon. As exemplified, the GCSP at Bucknell benefits from this extended synchronization as these goals no longer apply too exclusively with engineering majors. This allows for more interdisciplinary projects between majors, both between faculty members and students. Service learning experiences required by GCSP take on more diverse and vital roles under the Sustainable Development Goals theme, as they focus more specifically on more than the humanitarian aspect of the process. In conclusion, incorporating the Sustainable Development Goals into the NAE Grand Challenges Program would lead to a more fruitful pathway into sustainability in higher education. Motivated students and faculty are no longer bound by the limits of the exclusionary program, and as more people take on the challenge, we better ourselves for the quest for sustainability. Bucknell University has dedicated itself to this mission, and hope more institutions do the same.",4615,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),service learning",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Lam Ngo,4615,Undergraduate Student,Jessica Newlin,4615,"Faculty, Civil and Environmental Engineering", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9555/1430_Newlin_0922.pdf,,,
Experience The SDGs Abroad: Reimagine Your Curriculum with The GREEN Program,"The GREEN Program (TGP) is an experiential education and workforce development program for young leaders in sustainable development. Created for students, by students, TGP has introduced a new model for education abroad- driven by a desire to provide purposeful, hands-on industry exposure at a fraction of the time and cost. Inspired by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, our short-term, accredited, career focused approach creates truly transformative experiences for students around the world- unlocking doors to governmental, public, and private facility access, exclusive tours, and unique bucket-list experiences. Our unique partnerships with universities around the world allow our students to have a truly authentic experience by learning from local professors, experts and government officials that are working to advance the Global Goals. TGP seeks to redefine the classroom by enabling one-of-a-kind experiences like studying the effects of climate change on the top of our world's glaciers. Our presentation will review our unique educational and partnership models as a case study. We have had success bringing over 2500 student leaders abroad and have partnered with universities including Drexel, University of Pennsylvania, Australia National University, and Penn State.

Best Practices in Integrating Sustainability and Business Education ,"This workshop focuses on how to integrate sustainability concepts into business education and increase engagement with the business community to improve their impacts. The primary focus will be on how the 'B Corp Impact Assessment' framework can be used to integrate sustainability into business curriculum while facilitating crossdisciplinary engagement with non-business students and faculty. Faculty members will discuss how they have integrated sustainable development concepts into business curriculum, and business concepts into sustainability-related curricula, particularly among environmental disciplines. We will also discuss how the SDgs, and in particular their measurement, are shaping the design of business education to integrate sustainability principles. With the development of the UN Global Compact, which helps organizations identify business opportunities that help achieve the SDGs, as wells the UN Principles for Responsible Investing, which is focused on impact investing, the business community has been called to action to work through partnerships with the public sector to pursue courses of action to achieve global goals. Impact Assessment frameworks help businesses identify and measure the material impacts their operations have on environmental and social resources, which is the necessary first step in improving these impacts and sustainability performance.",4398,3655,,,,,,Curriculum,Investment & Finance,,"Business, Management, & Finance",,,,"sustainable business,b corporations,responsible investing",10/5/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Tammy Kowalczyk,4398,"Faculty, Professor ",Jessica Thomas,3655,Faculty, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8494/0830_Thomas_0885.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8493/0830_Kowalczyk_0885.pptx,,
Teaching Sustainability and Environmental Stewardship Through Contemporary Art,"What role can art play in solving current environmental challenges? What should artists do to promote awareness? Is it ethical for artists to make more objects in a world already littered with too many? These are questions students grapple with in an art history course I regularly teach on contemporary environmental art. In this AASHE session, people outside the 'art world' as well as those working in art and art history are invited to tackle them, too. I present the broad outlines of my course, and highlight how 'Contemporary Art in an Age of Global Warming' is helping the Environmental Studies program at a small liberal arts college instill in students an understanding of key principles of sustainability -- including the value and necessity of creative, inter- and multidisciplinary, collaborative approaches to problem-solving. Session attendees will be tasked with finding connections between their own course material, campus sustainability efforts and a sampling of artworks; an interactive exercise I use in my class will provide a framework. I conclude by describing a final project assignment I have developed and sharing successful collaborations my students have forged with campus sustainability and facilities staff, and with key constituents in the broader community of the town.",187,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,Fine & Performing Arts,Environmental Studies & Sciences,,,"arts & culture,environmental focus",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Jo Ortel,187,Nystrom Professor of Art History, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
"Advancing Sustainability: Student-led Projects, Interdisciplinary Studies, and Inter-Silo Teamwork","Carleton College's study abroad program titled 'Sustainable Energy Principles and Practices in India' exemplifies how higher education institutions can foster experiences and skills that students can use to promote sustainable development. The physics program involved a pre-departure course where students learned about the complexity of energy, what sustainability means in a developing country, and the interdisciplinary nature of these issues. While students were abroad in Auroville, they met with nonprofits, businesses, and individuals to delve deeper into the mentioned issues. Back in the US, students enrolled in a post-program course in which they focused their efforts on sustainability projects, such as developing a Climate Action Plan for the City of Northfield, and carrying out the '2017 Lighting Audit Project.' These two projects, in particular, suggest how institutions can help students gain the skills necessary to promote sustainability by fostering collaboration across organizational silos to achieve a desired goal. The '2017 Lighting Audit Project' successfully brought together students, faculty, and staff in a project that would save $17,000 a year, receive $66,000 in funding, and mitigate 155.3 tons of carbon dioxide (equivalent) every year. The project was led by the student-run Energy Club, and sought to install occupancy sensors in non-residential bathrooms and stairwells. The project required collaboration across several institutional divisions, including: facilities, custodial services, maintenance, the sustainability office, academic departments, and student clubs. The project involved performing light audits, calculating energy savings, and creating a proposal for funding. These events exemplify various ways higher education can implement SDG's into teaching and general campus life by 1) encouraging a sustainability focused club whose mission fosters learning and skill development, 2) implementing study abroad programs or interesting courses that blend a primary field of study and sustainability, 3) encouraging student led projects that involve inter-silo collaboration.",2821,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,"Physical & Earth Sciences (Chemistry, Geology, Atmospheric Sciences, etc)",,,,"study abroad,sustainability courses",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Alejandro Gallardo,2821,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
How Do We Meaningfully Integrate Sustainability Into Global Studies Curricula?,"As higher education increasingly acknowledges the necessity of producing a globally-engaged student body, it has a responsibility to create a high-quality and relevant global studies curriculum. Former iterations of global studies curricula tended to treat humans and the environment as separate entities, but the reality of their interconnectivity cannot be ignored. Furthermore, the notion of sustainability as an exclusive, stand-alone topic within global studies is antithetical to its true nature of being woven into the traditions of land use and ecosystem management. This networking session would be for administrators, faculty, and international education staff who are interested in sharing and learning about the different ways that global studies is taught and managed at different institutions. My home institution of Champlain College merges a professional focus with a liberal arts general education and has made the production of engaged global citizens part of its mission. We have developed an innovative, interdisciplinary global studies curriculum for our third-year students and expanded opportunities for study abroad and faculty-led travel courses in order to fulfill our mission. My hope is to share and brainstorm with others on how they achieve global education competencies. Lastly, I'd like to spend time on the question: How do we meaningfully integrate sustainability into global studies curricula in a way that is foundational, rather than supplemental, to student learning?",6009,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,International & Global Studies,,,,infusing sustainability,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Kristin Wolf,6009,Associate Professor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Campus Sustainability 101 - A New Course for First Year Students,"Due to their complex and global nature, modern environmental problems like climate change, water scarcity, or mass extinction events can be overwhelming and really, really scary, especially for college students who have too frequently been told about future horrors without being offered effective tools that can help to divert these problems. As such, students who care both about other people and the planet around them are left wondering: 'What am I to do?' Fortunately, the practice of sustainability - which balances the needs of people today with those of people in the future - can provide solutions to these challenging problems. With this in mind, a new course for incoming college students was developed and offered in the Fall of 2017 that explored the theoretical concepts supporting the emerging discipline of Sustainability Studies while offering students concrete opportunities for putting these ideas into practice. This session will present the structure, learning goals, and pedagogy of this new course as well as offer reflections on its effectiveness to promote academic and personal growth. In particular, assignments in support of the campus-based group sustainability project will be discussed. Session participants will be invited to consider the logistical elements necessary either to develop a similar course or to integrate a campus sustainability project into existing courses on their respective campuses.",8042,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,,,sustainability courses,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Jeanette Pope,8042,"Professor of Geosciences, Faculty Sustainability Coordinator", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
High Impact Pedagogical Practices for High Impact Sustainability Learning,"In the face of a rapidly-changing planet, sustainability is one of the most promising solutions to address social, economic, and environmental problems. Through IUPUI's Themed Learning Community (TLC), 'Sustainability: Thriving Communities, Thriving Planet,' students learned the causes and effects of some of our planet's biggest problems. Utilizing IUPUI's campus as a laboratory for sustainability, the essential question explored during the semester was, 'As a critical thinker, how can I apply sustainable solutions to create thriving communities and a thriving planet?' This question was explored through the hands-on application of sustainability principles, including high impact pedagogical practices such as service learning, reflections, out-of-classroom experiences, active learning strategies, course integration, and applications to the Greening IUPUI Grant. Evidence from student reflections indicates these high impact practices created a more robust learning experience, and all students expressed the value of the TLC in shaping their opinions and behavior to create a more sustainable community. This presentation will explore each high impact pedagogical practice employed and its ability to be transferred to other courses.",1353,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"learning communities,solutions focus",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jessica Davis,1353,"Director, IUPUI Office of Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

Planning and Implementing a University-Wide Curriculum Disruption to Teach About Climate Justice,"From February 26-March 2, 2018, The New School will invite all 14,000 faculty, staff, and students to participate in a university-wide curriculum disruption entitled 'Disrupt Climate Injustice.' This means stopping 'business as usual' to turn our attention to climate change, its implications, and its unequal and devastating impacts on vulnerable communities around the globe. This disruption is an opportunity to come together to take concrete action toward fighting climate change and supporting climate justice in an effort led by the university-wide Tishman Environment and Design Center. The curriculum disruption includes special activities occurring in classes, a series of extracurricular workshops and public events on campus, and engagement through social media. Resources prepared for faculty ahead of the disruption include: suggested readings and videos, sample lesson plans and conversation starters, assistance with guest lecture facilitation, and faculty liaisons for each school to address questions or concerns from colleagues who are less familiar with climate change. Attend this session to learn more about the planning and implementation process for disrupting curriculum university-wide in order to foster critical dialogue, learning, and reflection about climate change and its impacts.

Improving Our Understanding of Sustainability with Bio-Mimicry,"Some systems are much more sustainable than others, and this is not random. It is because certain key properties are present in more sustainable systems, but absent from unsustainable systems. Because we are in a period of rapid global changes, it may take decades or centuries for us humans to directly identify many of these key properties that promote sustainability. However, within nature, the systems with the most sustainable properties have already had millions of years to displace those with less sustainable properties. The properties within the planet's sustainable natural systems can be interpreted and applied (i.e. bio-mimicry) to an unlimited number of human contexts, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Key Competencies in Sustainability: Overview and Next Steps,"The Panel-discussion is part of a nationwide process to solicit feedback on an initiative with the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE). The goal of the initiative is to develop an overview of the landscape of key competencies in sustainability across higher education institutions. Over the last couple of months, members of the NCSE initiative have engaged in listening sessions across the country to learn how higher education institutions employ key competencies in sustainability to develop sustainability curricula on the level of courses/programs and how they arrived at formulating learning outcomes for courses/programs, considering the different groups involved across a school or even university. The panel will report back what they have heard during these listening sessions and offer their initial lessons learned for discussion with the audience. The goal of the discussion with the audience is to solicit feedback on two questions. First, how can key competencies in sustainability help guide curriculum development and administration of sustainability degree programs?

Applied Learning: Interventions for Sustainability Impacts ,"Applied learning (AL) for sustainability is an umbrella term and encompasses student engagement activities (e.g., internships, courses, research practicums) that deliver exceptional student experiences and a positive outcome for sustainability in the community. AL is exemplified in sustainability projects that are launched in collaboration with community partners (NGOs, cities, businesses). These efforts require the involvement of various entities within the university and in the community - and thus require a thoughtful strategy in order to launch and scale. The purpose of this workshop is to empower and activate staff or faculty who are involved in building or growing AL programs at their institution. We will review interventions for building successful AL programs and then adapt or transfer those concepts in order to design a specific intervention that supports their institution's AL program. The focus can be on initiating an AL program, launching it, growing it, or institutionalizing it. Participants will self-select into their peer-group (Kick-starter, intermediate, and advanced sustainability brokers). Each group will be supported by 1-2 facilitators. Participants will work through a series of five steps to develop their intervention, using the activities and tools presented by the workshop organizers and other participants (peer-learning) to design their intervention.",4531,2515,2597,2243,,,,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,,applied learning,10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Katja Brundiers,4531,Research Assistant Professor,Fletcher Beaudoin,2515,Assistant Director,Caroline Savage,2597,Campus as a Living Lab Manager,Rachelle Haddock,2243,"Project Coordinator, Campus as a Learning Lab", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7942/0830_Savage_0369.pptx,,,
Key Competencies in Sustainability: Curriculum and Program Development ,"Every year, new sustainability degree programs are launched at colleges and universities across the USA joining a global trend of sustainability degree programs offered at higher education institutions worldwide. This raises important questions for the field of sustainability in higher education related to quality and standards, processes of program development and administration, and communicating the skills and abilities sustainability graduates would have to potential employers. In early 2018, the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) launched a process focusing on 'key competencies' in sustainability degree programs in collaboration with the Sustainability Curriculum Consortium (SCC) and NCSE member institutions, including the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University (ASU) and University of Northern Arizona (NAU). The goal of this initiative, through workshops, dialogues and other activities, is to create a 'Consensus Statement' on sustainability competencies. This workshop led by members in this initiative from NCSE, SCC, ASU and NAU, is an opportunity to inform about the initiative's progress to date; to further explore the above questions; and, to invite workshop participants to contribute their experiences and insights to a shared and growing body of knowledge around key competencies in sustainability degree programs.",6873,567,4531,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,,"competencies,degree programs",10/5/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Ira Feldman,6873,Founder & Managing Director,Rod Parnell,567,Coordinator of Academic Sustainability & Professor,Katja Brundiers,4531,Research Assistant Professor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8106/0830_Parnell_0521.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8106/0830_Parnell_0521.pdf,,
So You've Been Told to Teach About Sustainability? Now What?,"Sustainability curriculum in higher education is increasingly institutionalized; we have moved past the 'early adopters' across the faculty who have been drivers of sustainability across the curriculum. What happens when new faculty, or those with no background in sustainability, are asked to incorporate sustainability subject matter into their classes? Most faculty members' disciplinary training does not include sustainability. Thus, a need exists to articulate and share with faculty the core concepts of sustainability subject-matter and how to include them. This session aims to explore 'what to teach' when tasked with teaching about sustainability. Three perspectives are offered. The first presenter will share findings from an exhaustive literature review about what prior research on teaching about sustainability in higher education identifies as the 'core' sustainability ideas (e.g., climate crises, future generations, resource management, poverty, and environmental justice) Second, from a practice perspective, the co-presenter will share an example of core concepts and key terms used in the University of Hawaii System Sustainability Curriculum (such as sustainable economics, ecosystem services, and equity). Third, the presenters will extrapolate core subject matter ideas from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (such as climate action, clean water and sanitation, and affordable and clean energy). Weaving these three perspectives together, the session will conclude with an iterative discussion about what the core concepts of sustainability are, and how participants can bring the ideas back to their campuses to support faculty members in more meaningfully incorporate sustainability into their coursework.",4021,2269,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,,"faculty,infusing sustainability",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jessica Michel,4021,Graduate Student,Krista Hiser,2269,Professor and UH System Sustainability Coordinator at University of Hawaii., ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Campus Sustainability Plans as Pedagogical Opportunities for High Impact Student Experiences,"As universities strive for increased sustainability, there is a growing need for coordinated and comprehensive campus sustainability plans that provide specific action items and clear roadmaps to improved sustainability within key areas like transportation, landscape, food systems, energy, and waste among others. Although many institutions have general campus sustainability plans, the plans often lack more specific and detailed goals, strategies, and tactics for improving sustainability within these sectors. The research and crafting of these more detailed plans present great opportunities for student learning. Sustainability education high impact practices emphasize the importance of project-based, applied learning experiences as well as collaborative learning. Higher education professionals also emphasize the importance of capstone signature experiences. At Furman University, we have combined the need for improved sustainability planning with the student educational experience. Students in our senior capstone sustainability science practicum class work in student teams to address and develop detailed, integrated, and holistic vision and master plans for different sustainability campus sectors including alternative transportation, eco-friendly landscaping, and sustainable food systems. Over the course of a year, teams meet with key stakeholders, review the literature, assess the current state, assemble best practices, and collect data to inform their vision and plans for improving sustainability within each sector. The resulting written report serves as a foundational and guiding document for improving sustainability in each sector and can be used to inform and improve Furman's Sustainability Tracking Assessment and Rating System (STARS) performance. This poster will describe the capstone course and design, and present some results from this latest iteration of the course.",3836,,,,,,,Curriculum,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"sustainability plans,pedagogy",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Weston Dripps,3836,"Executive Director, David E.

How Higher Education is approaching its commitment to sustainability through sustainability courses,"For over a decade, the concepts of education for sustainable development have been recognized by many higher education institutes. A significant number of higher education institutions have signed agreements and declarations to educate students in all disciplines about sustainability. Although several institutions of higher education have signed the sustainability declarations, literature review finds little evidence that their curriculums have been modified to include education for sustainable development. There is obvious and widespread provision for the concept of student education in sustainable education; there is the little implementation of these decelerations at a practical level. In recent years, sustainability focused courses have been established at many higher education institutions. However, such courses lack systematic evaluation to measure the learning outcomes for sustainability within their sustainability courses. This research study has assessed the learning outcomes of these sustainability focused courses through examining the syllabi of these courses and interviewing instructors about how they integrate sustainability in courses. Qualitative responses were examined in light of a learning outcomes of sustainability education proposed American association for advancement of sustainability in higher education (AASHE) and higher education institute. Notable findings were: substantial responses recognized the conceptual understanding of environmental (81%), economic (50%) and social (31%) dimension of sustainability as LO of sustainability focused courses-but just three instructor highlighted all three dimensions. 50% instructors showed that they consider student attitude around concept as main learning outcome of their courses. Environmental stewardship were characterized as learning outcome by 83% instructors, though many of them didn't provide any evidence and details about it.",1817,,,,,,,Curriculum,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"Education for Sustainable Development,sustainability courses,syllabi",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Saman Khan,1817,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9596/1430_Khan_0963.pptx,,,
"Social Environmental Case Study on Mining, Wild Rice and Water Protection in Minnesota","This session involves participants in a social environmental synthesis case study, using methods taught by the National Social Environmental Synthesis Center (sesync.org) in Maryland, where this case was developed at a workshop. Case studies offer students a chance to practice mapping complex systems, analyzing tradeoffs and understanding stakeholder perspectives. The case is on a current, contested issue at the intersection of culture, economics and environment in Minnesota - the appropriate way to protect wild rice from impacts of proposed copper sulfate mining and other sources of sulfate. Wild rice, an edible, nutty-flavored grain, grows in shallow waters in Minnesota. Each fall, people harvest wild rice by canoe, using knocking sticks to strike the plants and cause ripe grains to fall. The Ojibwe origin story tells of migration from the east to where 'food grows on water.' American Indian people retain treaty rights to harvest rice. Outside reservations (there are 12 recognized tribal communities in Minnesota), harvest of wild rice is regulated. Minnesota has research-based sulfate level regulation for water where wild rice grows. Sulfate reacts to elements in lake sediment and becomes sulfide, taken up by the plant's stem, and impairing growth. Minnesota's regulation was scarcely enforced until 2010, when new copper-sulfate mines, one called PolyMet, were proposed in a mining region near Minnesota's Boundary Waters. Minnesota's mining area is known as the 'Iron Range' for the taconite ore used in steelmaking. Miners generally support new mines, while environmentalists and American Indian community groups typically oppose them. Participants will make a system map and analyze the stakeholders and their influence in the wild rice case. I hope participants will be inspired to bring the challenge, and complexity, of case studies to their own sustainability classroom. The SESYNC case study library will also be presented.",32,,,,,,,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,,case based learning,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Beth Mercer-Taylor,32,Sustainability Education Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Sustainable Justice in Wisconsin: Strategies for Program Growth in Harsh Climates,"As evidenced by AASHE's recent Keynote presenters--from Julian Agyeman (2010) on 'Just Sustainabilities' to Marsha Chatelain's creation of the #fergusonsyllabus (2016)--AASHE's present and future directions foreground strengthening connections between environmental justice (a grassroots movement of working class people and communities of color) and sustainability (a largely white and middle-class movement for transforming business, industry, and public utilities). How can that transdisciplinary vision be articulated through college campuses that are largely disciplinary-based? Our campus took on that challenge, providing annual Sustainability-Across-the-Curriculum workshops, mentoring faculty to support their decisions to infuse social justice-driven courses with analyses of economics and environment, and to offer cultural diversity trainings to faculty oriented primarily to environmental sciences. Inspired by Agyeman's work, our new Sustainable Justice Minor offers curriculum across all four university colleges, with foundations and capstone courses that are co-taught and bridge university-community bounds. Enlivening both students and faculty through film-and-discussion series, through mindfulness pedagogy, art-based sustainability workshops and pop-ups, and regional sustainability bus tours are some of our tools. We also work with the larger state university system by participating in the all-campus Environmental Programs consortium, that is creating a place-based summer program.",508,,,,,,,Curriculum,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,,"environmental justice,social justice,degree programs",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Grace Coggio,508,Associate Professor,Greta Gaard,508,"Professor and Coordinator, Sustainable Justice Minor", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8271/0830_Gaard_0658.pptx,,,
Education as the Engine for the Global Goals,"In 2016, 750 experts from around the world came together in Ahmedabad, India, to drill down into each of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), or Global Goals, to identify how education is necessary to achieve all of the SDGs. The first group to meet (beyond COP21 in Paris) after the adoption of the SDGs, by the UN member states, in 2015, the ESDG participants highlighted how it isn't enough to just tuck away Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in Target 4.7. As a 'Driver' for the SDGs, education should be front and center, as it is necessary to educate across all sectors and disciplines, in a variety of formal, nonformal, and informal educational modalities. As the higher education envoy for UN University, AASHE, and the US Partnership for ESD at the ESDG conference, presenter Kim Smith co-authored a list of recommendations for how higher education could help serve as an engine for the SDGs. These recommendations were combined with contributions for all of the SDGs, to offer a document of great worth and guidance for educators, institutions, and leaders to help implement the SDGs across their communities.

Integration of the SDG's as a Targeted Educational Alternative...A Story of Successful Collaboration,"Join us as we share a Story of Success: UTRGV and Buell Central High School's Transformative integration of SDG's to engage and motivate our most vulnerable and marginalized youth. Buell Central High School is a Disciplinary Alternative Education Program (DAEP) within PSJA-ISD, that has a student population from low socio-economic backgrounds, and out of the juvenile justice system. The majority, approximately 98% of these students live in poverty and violence, and cope with the effects of racism, colonialism, homophobia, neglect, abuse, sexual assault and exploitation, homelessness, mental illness, grief, and undiagnosed learning difficulties. Join us and hear the story behind the school's principle who's past, not much different from his current students, brought him full circle back to the community where he grew up. Come learn how a simple phone call established a relationship (with UTRGV) that helped develop an inclusive and holistic learning framework of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) through project based learning. Come see how this transformative program offers productive possibilities for social and educational change through the numerous projects the students have completed which address and contribute to SDG's within their own communities.

Backcasting to the Future: SDGs and Graduate Research,"Preparing sustainability graduate students for the future requires a balance of real-world work and project applications as well as research and publishing experiences and opportunities. It means guiding the challenging transdisciplinary work of exploring issues by connecting a multidisciplinary approach to real life experiences. As emerging sustainability professionals, it is imperative to provide graduate students with the understanding of how theory meets practice, and prepare them to do so in a professional manner. This workshop will outline an instructional design process used in the IU South Bend graduate course SUST-S610 Measuring Sustainability. In the course, students are introduced to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, a range of Sustainability Reporting Tools (SRTs), and local sustainability issues. Students are challenged to research how to meet the needs of a local partner or address a local issue by using the SDGs to place them in a global context. In the course, the result is a publishable and publically useful document analyzing the relationship between measuring sustainability and decision-making in theory and practice,the SDGs, and utilizes at least one SRT. These documents may take the form of a white paper, series of blogs, website, database, or other SRT deliverable. How to introduce issues, theory, context, and transdisciplinary application will be shared. Workshop attendees will gain first hand experience in course design and implementation. Small group work will challenge participants to weave the elements together into a project proposal. Ways to conduct reflection on the process and end result will conclude the session. This session is ideal for undergraduates curious about next steps in a sustainability academic career, for faculty looking for ways to integrate SDGs into courses, and for administrators interested in the larger role that sustainability education can play in preparing students for locally and globally relevant work.",1350,,,,,,,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),sustainability courses,graduate students",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Krista Bailey,1350,Center for a Sustainable Future/Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8929/1430_Bailey_0206.pdf,,,
Nation's First Community-Based Culinary Medicine Garden and Sustainability Curriculum,"We have the nation's first Culinary Medicine (CM) course pairing community members and Health Sciences (HS) students together to research, design, and implement community-based CM curricula, the inclusion in CM of culturally-appropriate foods, and community-based health, nutrition, and sustainability education and research. Our classes are taught by HS students from the University of Utah (U.), along with community members receiving a stipend from the U. for their research and teaching work. This is a reciprocal learning model, building upon one another's strengths to facilitate programming that develops community capacity, breaks down barriers to health equity and healthy environments, as well as creating pathways to higher education in Health Sciences and Sustainable Nutritional within minority populations. This model is significant as approximately 65,000 refugees from over 30 countries have been resettled in Utah, 99% of whom live in food deserts. There is a general lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and an even more pronounced dearth of foods native to their countries of origin. This is an exigent issue as racial/ethnic minorities are 1.5 to 2 times as likely as whites to develop major chronic diet-related diseases, and enrollment in U.S. Medical schools consist of 58.8% White, 19.8% Asian, 5.7% African-American, 4.6% Latino/Hispanic students, leading to a gap in representation of our communities and their respective needs. Community-led health outreach members collaborating with health service providers have proved beneficial to health outcomes in ethnic and racial minority communities. And, as we are the nation's first school to provide Medical, Nursing, Dentistry, and Pharmacy Students with sustainability curricula within Culinary Medicine, we provide our next generation of diverse health professionals with critical lenses on environmental, cultural, and food justices as requisite aspects of holistic health.",3994,,,,,,,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,,"gardens,environmental justice,medicinal focus",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Shannon Jones,3994,Associate Instructor/Project Lead, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Greening the Chemistry Research and Teaching Labs: Resources to Increase Safety and Reduce Waste,"University and college campuses across the United States are pushing the envelope on greening their campus facilities, operations, and processes. However, despite their disproportionate consumption of resources, laboratories are often excluded from sustainability programs. Bringing sustainable practices into research and teaching laboratories can have a significant impact on increasing safety, conserving energy, reducing waste and hazardous chemical usage, amongst other tangible benefits. This presentation will provide attendees with resources that can be readily implemented within the chemistry research and teaching laboratories, spanning from conservation approaches to greener alternative substitutions. Green chemistry in practice has proven to provide a safer working environment for researchers and students, while maintaining a high level of rigor for teaching and excellence in research. In this session, appropriate for faculty, students of all levels, researchers, and EHS personnel, the connection of safety and ethics issues to real-world applications of safer chemical approaches in the laboratory will be made. Examples will be presented from universities who are actively implementing safer, greener laboratory practices across research and teaching divisions. Additionally, resources will be presented to enable participants to engage with their chemistry departments through green chemistry.",32,7596,,,,,,Curriculum,Research,Waste,"Physical & Earth Sciences (Chemistry, Geology, Atmospheric Sciences, etc)",,,,"green chemistry,green labs",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Jane Wissinger,32,Professor and Organic Lab Director,Amy Cannon,7596,Executive Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8045/1130_Wissinger_0457.pdf,,,
Linking Teaching Practices to Students' Pro-Sustainability Behaviors,"Broadly integrating sustainability throughout higher education curriculum is a common goal among instructors, scholars, and the AASHE community. But while sustainability knowledge is good in its own right, research has shown that the link between increased knowledge and behaviors required to address many current environmental, economic, and social challenges is tenuous at best. Implementing sustainability into a wide array of courses provides an opportunity for a great new number of instructors and teaching practices to become involved in the conversation. So while the knowledge taught in classrooms may not, in itself, lead to the change we seek, it is possible teachers and certain styles of teaching may. In order to investigate if the way sustainability curriculum is delivered influences students' sustainability behaviors, we analyzed data from two recent surveys of undergraduate students conducted at the beginning and end of the semester. We explored a variety of teaching techniques that research has pointed to as 'good' teaching practices. We found that while all of these methods may be equally good at imparting knowledge, some are better than others in regards to increasing sustainability-related behaviors. For example, we found that when instructors guided students to use what they already know (by tapping their prior knowledge) to help them learn about sustainability, students increased their pro-sustainability behaviors over the course of the semester.",4021,439,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,,"behavior change,pedagogy,teaching sustainability",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Jessica Michel,4021,Graduate Student,Adam Zwickle,439,Assistant Professor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Teaching Sustainability Through Non-Traditional Learning Methods,"To address complex global challenges, such as 'climate change, poverty, violent conflicts, and overuse of natural resources' (Brundiers & Wiek, 2011, p. 108) a growing number of institutions of higher education have incorporated the concept of teaching sustainability, which is referred to as sustainability education, to create a more sustainable society with sustainability literate individuals. Sustainability literacy indicates an individual 'having the understanding, skills, attitudes and attributes to take informed action for the benefit of oneself and others, now and into a long-term future' (Diamond & Irwin, 2012, p. 339). It requires an individual's 'ability and disposition to engage in thinking, problem solving, decision making, and actions associated with achieving sustainability' (Nolet, 2009, p. 421). Going further, sustainability education encourages students to participate in problem- and solution-oriented research (Brundiers & Wiek, 2011, p. 108). Instead of lectures, faculty are finding it beneficial to use creative methods to teach the concept of sustainability, because they find the non-traditional teaching and learning methods encourage students' critical thinking and engagement. There are various teaching and learning approaches to teaching the concept of sustainability, such as, case-based instruction, experiential learning, problem-based learning, role-play learning, service learning, and teamwork. Case-based instruction refers to the use of case studies in teaching. Experiential learning refers to learning through experience. Problem-based learning is a focused, experiential learning approach that addresses a specific problem through investigation and explanation often through use of small collaborative groups (Hmelo-Silver, 2004, p. 236). With the role-play learning approach students take on different roles and act out a scenario. Service-learning promotes educational opportunities that students participate in and reflect.",828,,,,,,,Curriculum,Research,,,,,,"teaching sustainability,service learning",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Renee Harmon,828,Instructor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Preliminary Assessment of the Impact of Changes in Campus Sustainability Efforts on Student Environmental Knowledge and Behaviors,"At Pittsburg State University, efforts to promote sustainability and environmental awareness has increased substantially since 2012. A formal Recycling Services Department was created, the number of activities by a campus student sustainability group increased, a new sustainability degree program was created, participation in the STARs program expanded the awareness of sustainability in the curriculum for faculty, and sustainability was included as a core value in the updated university strategic plan. While indicators such as the increase in material recycled demonstrate that campus efforts are making a substantial difference, the impact on students in unclear. To explore this, Pittsburg State University began implementing an annual survey in August 2014 to measure environmental literacy and behaviors of incoming freshman. The same survey was then given to the same group/cohort of students in the spring semester of their junior year to see whether there was any significant difference in their environmental knowledge and/or behaviors after five semesters of undergraduate enrollment. The results presented here are the preliminary analysis of two different cohorts of undergraduate students. While it is not possible to demonstrate a direct link between exposure to these campus efforts and a change in knowledge and/or behaviors, it does provide a platform to explore whether an increase in sustainability efforts on campus is having an impact on students. Identifying any trends is important, as PSU is currently expanding their sustainability efforts, both inside and outside the classroom.",1234,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"assessment,environmental literacy,behavior change",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Alicia Mason,1234,Associate Professor of Communication,Catherine Hooey,1234,Professor of Geography, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

Driving Creative Sustainable Solutions Using a Design Thinking Approach in the Engineering Classroom,"Design for the Environment, an upper-level undergraduate engineering course, is designed for students to develop a working knowledge of sustainable engineering in a way that enables them to apply it to their future career. The course content includes sustainability design frameworks, life cycle thinking, toxicity and risk, designing appropriate technologies within the context of the developing world, and case studies focused on the nexus of water, energy, and agriculture. A mix of lectures, in-class group activities, out-of-class assignments, whole class discussion, and hands-on prototyping are employed to offer students a diverse learning experience. The centerpiece of the course is the development of an engineering solution to a real-world sustainability challenge, the topics of which range from reducing food waste to enhancing sustainability of the built environment. This term-long group project serves as a way for students to apply content learned in the course. Design thinking - a five-stage process that guides students in empathizing with the user's needs, defining the problem, brainstorming solutions, creating simple prototypes, and testing the prototypes, iteratively ideating, prototyping, and testing to reach the best solution - was introduced with the goal of inspiring more innovative solutions. This approach to teaching sustainable design is unique because it allows the students to define the problem themselves and engage in divergent thinking skills, both of which are often missing from engineering courses. This presentation will include the evolution of the course, from inception to implementation, as well as preliminary results from an assessment plan aimed at evaluating students' (i) practice of sustainability in their design solutions, (ii) execution of the design thinking process, (iii) perceptions of active learning and their own creativity, (iv) oral presentation skills, and (v) other developmental outcomes related to their engineering careers.",760,,,,,,,Curriculum,Research,,Engineering,Design,,,"design thinking,sustainability courses",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Lisa Stabryla,760,PhD Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9073/1430_Stabryla_0379.pdf,,,
Multimodal Texts as a Window to Sustainability,"Within the four walls of the elementary (K-5) and secondary content area (6-12) classroom, the limited experiential realm of education can be expanded through the strategic use of sustainability texts including rich media in addition to children's and adolescent literature. Teacher candidates engaged in planning and executing lessons utilize best practices in sustainability education by exploring multimodal narratives to enrich and widen student perspectives regarding sustainability issues in the 21st century. A wide range of sustainability topics can be addressed in class discussion, writing and projects. This poster will highlight sustainability multimodal texts within an organizational construct providing ideas for pedagogical application. Resources will include: video, printed text, digital, and visual narratives categorized by theme or topic. Video texts draw the viewer into scenarios tracing sustainability historically, or placing it in future contexts. Genres will include: documentaries, movies, TED talks, animation. Printed text will include: poetry, short stories, science fiction such cli-fi, graphic novels, memoir, magazines and non-fiction. Digital texts will categorize sustainability websites: government, educational, and social platforms. Visual narratives will include environmental art (sculpture, painting, and eco-art), photography, and printmaking. The resources are categorized by theme: agriculture and fisheries, biodiversity, climate change and atmosphere, consumption patterns, desertification and drought, disaster reduction, sanitation, human labor and social rights, lands, soils, forests and mountains, poverty, production patterns, seas and oceans, sustainable development, tourism, transportation, fair trade, energy, gender equity, indigenous people, population growth, land use, protecting and promoting human health.

Using the U.N. SDGs to Foster Systems Thinking in Incoming First-Year Students,"The Summer STEM Institute (SSI) is an annual program that engages incoming freshman in STEM research and career pathway exploration in a week long experience. In previous years, SSI students learned a wide variety of STEM-related concepts and careers. Group research and final posters were based on career interests. In 2017, a common theme for all research projects and final posters across all 3 main Valencia College campuses (in Orlando) was used for the first time. The U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) served as the framework for the group research project and the context to promote learning outcomes in systems thinking, creativity, and complex problem solving (STEM solutions to improve quality of life). The concept of sustainability and the SDGs are specific enough to anchor students to a common STEM related topic, yet broad enough to provide ample freedom in choosing a diverse set of targets and potential solutions. Teams of 4 chose which of 9 SDGs their team would examine and present solutions for by the end of the week at a poster gallery. Each of the four team members represented either Science, Technology, Engineering, or Math (STEM) and were independently responsible to examine their team SDG solution through their specific STEM lens.

Teaching Sustainability in the Landscape Architecture Field,"The purpose of this mixed method study is 1) to describe the current status of sustainability teaching in the landscape architecture programs and 2) to explore landscape architecture faculty perspectives on teaching sustainability. 'As sustainable landscapes are increasingly requested and required' (Dinep & Schwab, 2010), theories, methods and strategies for sustainable landscape practice are widely discussed (Dinep & Schwab, 2010; Calkins, 2011; Beata, 2014; Yokohari, 2016). However, studies focused on sustainable landscape education were insufficient, resulting in a gap in the literature on how sustainable landscape is taught in high education institutions. To fill this gap, we raised the following research questions: 1) How is sustainability reflected in the mission statements, program descriptions, and curriculums of the landscape architecture programs? 2) How do landscape architecture faculty define sustainability? 3) How do faculty teach sustainability? 4) What are the benefits and barriers for teaching sustainability in landscape architecture field? A three-phase mixed methods research design is used to explore the research questions. The research data is collected from the landscape architecture programs accredited by Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board (LAAB) in the USA. In the first phase, mission statements from LAAB-accredited landscape architecture programs are collected and analyzed through content analysis. In the second phase, curriculums LAAB-accredited landscape architecture programs are collected and analyzed through assigning scores using a rubric. In the third phase, a survey is conducted focusing on faculty member's perspective of sustainability teaching in the landscape architecture field. The quantitative and qualitative outcomes come from the three phases will help us better understand how sustainability is taught in the landscape architecture field in the USA.",400,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,Architecture,,,,"landscaping,landscape architecture",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Dan Li,400,PhD Candidate, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9541/1430_Li_0909.pdf,,,
Using S Designation to Build an Embedded Certificate and Create Coherence,"The University of Hawaii 10 campus system uses common criteria and a process of interdiscipinary dialogue to designate sustainability focused courses across all ten campuses. A system-wide minor in sustainability is emerging as an embedded certificate in the general education curriculum.

"Creating Learning, Teaching, and Operational Partnerships Through Campus as a Living Labs","In this presentation, three campuses, will share their Campus as a Living Lab projects. The Sustainability Office at UW-Whitewater will describe two collaborations between faculty and the campus sustainability coordinator. Session participants will be given practical examples of how project-based learning was incorporated into a sustainability management course and an environmental policy course including student-led projects such as students using real campus data from AASHE STARS and by having sustainability staff actively involved in the classroom. Sustainability Staff from San Mateo Community College District (SMCCCD) will discuss the opportunities of bridging Facilities with curriculum and students by partnering with faculty to conduct campus as a living lab sustainability projects. Examples include: comprehensive indoor water audit, and zero waste behavior change research. Campus as a living lab provides academic excellence by creating insightful data for Facilities and invaluable sustainability awareness and experience. Finally, the Associate Librarian at San Jose State University's King Library, describes her experience of working with faculty and students in an Art History Design in Society course, to help students learn about sustainable design and features in LEED certified buildings.

Enhancing Student Learning and Promoting Sustainability Through Experiential Learning,"This session includes experiential learning programs in three academic institutions.The programs illustrate how higher education institutions can foster public-private-community partnerships to achieve the SDGs and inform approaches to SDG 17. A short description of each program is given below. New York University(NYU)'s class in the College of Arts and Science aimed to develop real world proposals for green infrastructure projects on NYU's Washington Square campus. Students developed four storm water management projects to keep polluted runoff out of the city's waterways. At the end of the term, proposals were presented to the University leadership that has taken steps to implement the proposals. University of Dayton(UD)'s Dayton Regional Green (DRG) internship program and the River Stewards program exemplify approach to experiential learning at the University. DRG is a local sustainability organization. An internship program was created to support DRG initiatives through experiential learning. The nationally recognized River Stewards program is a three-year transdisciplinary program focused on leadership development and civic engagement. Worcester Polytechnic Institute(WPI) has developed a project-based curriculum with a wide array of programs addressing sustainability at all grade levels.

Design Thinking and Sustainability,"This session will review two case studies involving design thinking and sustainability: Grand Valley State University The presentation will reflect on the learning process of students engaged in developing the learning curriculum of a $10 million campaign to expand the DeVos Family Center for Scouting in Grand Rapids, MI. In the Spring of 2018, twenty-four students enrolled in Design Thinking to Meet Real World needs were assigned as their semester long project the task of designing learning opportunities for the education of Sustainability, STEAM, & Leadership in unrepresented, low income, and minority communities. The goal of the course is to have students apply theories observed in the course to a real-life case study, while collaborating with stakeholders in a human centered design. Students research, discuss, analyze, and design a summer enrichment program. University of Pittsburgh Design for the Environment is an undergraduate course in which students develop a working knowledge of and the ability to apply principles of sustainable engineering. An underpinning of the course is the application of the Design Thinking process and content learned in the course to tackle a sustainability challenge. Topics range from reducing food waste to enhancing sustainability of the built environment. This presentation will discuss the foundations of the course and include preliminary results from an assessment plan aimed at evaluating the development of student learning.",760,2426,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,,"design thinking,case based learning",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Leanne Gilbertson,760,Assistant Professor,Darien Ripple,2426,Visiting Assistant Professor,Lisa Stabryla,760,PhD Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9662/0915_Gilbertson.pdf,,,
"Sustainability Competencies, SDGs & Metacognition: Implementation and Assessment","Core learning sustainability competencies have been identified and are guiding course design: system thinking, future/temporal thinking, ethical literacy (values), interpersonal literacy (communication & collaboration), strategic thinking (action), and creativity/imagination. This session shares experience and research on the design, implementation, and assessment of two collaborations: 1. City University of New York, University Centre at Svalbard (UNIS, Norway), Fordham University, and Saint Peter's University; and 2. Leuphana University (Germany), and Arizona State University (ASU/LU double masters degree program in Global Sustainability Science). Faculty development workshop templates employing sustainability competencies are also presented. Curriculum design and assessment approach vary. The photovoice method was applied by the ASU/LU program to enable students to track their own learning processes, promote critical dialogue and assessment of key sustainability competencies, and empower students to become change agents. Advantages, limitations, and gas are identified from the experience of the use of pre- and post- assessment instruments: the legacy New Ecological/Environmental Paradigm - Revised; the emerging Sulitest Sustainability learning self-assessment; and qualitative case studies and reflection essays. Ongoing research of meta-cognition of ecosystem science in practice is referred to for insights.

Student Voices as the Key to Sustainability Assessment,"Sustainability encourages a rich and broad awareness of our selves in the world. Assessment of sustainability learning should reflect the powerful insights and values that we hope sustainability education encourages. Student reflection is a powerful tool for both their learning and our evaluation of their learning. Our panel will offer two perspectives on assessment through student reflection which share the key insight of student voices themselves. Our first presentation will share examples of positive results from high-impact practice as reflected in carefully-designed course-specific and student learning outcomes and assessments. The second presentation will explore assessment through applied projects (the program's capstone) and written reflection (the program's portfolio), with an emphasis on core competences for sustainability.

University Workshops Cultivating a Culture of Sustainability on Campus and Beyond,"Faculty from West Chester University and University of Kentucky will join forces to share with AASHE members models of university workshops that foster a culture of sustainability. Beyond teaching sustainability, the workshops encourage interdisciplinary collaboration, best practices and strategies to align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and consider ways in which faculty can implement sustainable methods of teaching into their curricula. Our workshops innovate by comprehensively integrating the local and global with the social, economic, and environmental aspects of sustainability. By attending this conference session, AASHE members will learn about: the distinctive qualities of the Brandywine Project (West Chester University) and the Sustain-able Pedagogies Workshop (University of Kentucky); how their institution can create similar workshops to serve their local needs; how to organize campus resources for workshops; and expansion workshops for staff and students.

China Focus - Middlebury's Global Partnership for Sustainability and University of Minnesota's Environment and Cultural Diversity,"This session, in a case study format, presents the driving motivations, objectives, current status and challenges of 1) Middelbury's Global Partnerships for Sustainability project in China and 2) the University of Minnesota's faculty-led short-term summer program in Yunnan Province. Providing an equal exchange, rather than an asymmetrical one, of educational goods is an important goal of Middlebury's 17 schools abroad with respect to the countries they operate in. How do such programs assure that they are providing value to the countries that host them at least equal to the value imparted on the schools and the students who study there? Middlebury's Global Partnerships for Sustainability in Kunming, Hangzhou, and Beijing partners with the Nature Conservancy (TNC) of China to provide hands-on learning opportunities for students while advancing TNC's goals of engaging Chinese citizens in their wetland and biodiversity conservation efforts. University of Minnesota's Environmental and Cultural Diversity program reframes students' ideas of sustainability in China, inviting them to see nature, culture and livelihoods holistically. Chinese approaches to environmental protection and support for cultural heritage are markedly different than in the US. Yunnan itself is known for mountains, clean air, spring-like climate, historically preserved cities and diverse ethnic groups. Half of China depends on fresh water flowing through Yunnan's river basins. In cities like Shangrila, nature and culture are commoditized into spectacle. Tourism reaches local communities and landscapes to profoundly change relationships of people, plants and animals.

Why Calculate When I Can Google? Quantitative Tools for Assessing the SDGs,"AASHE 2018 poses the question: How can higher education institutions align their teaching and research activities around the SDGs? Assessment of countries' progress toward the SDGs requires data analysis and, often, estimations in the absence of complete data. This talk will describe an undergraduate course that helps students develop a quantitative toolbox for assessing environmental problems. The course was taught at both of the speakers' institutions during Spring 2018, and has been offered at one institution since 2003. Specific focus is given to estimation techniques, strategies for making reasonable assumptions, and how to assess the assumptions that may affect the quality of online data. The speakers will discuss both the technical skills in the curriculum and the resistance they face when students would rather google an answer then go through the work of calculating it. The speakers will also share strategies for addressing students' lack of confidence in their quantitative ability.",1660,2876,,,,,,Curriculum,Research,,Mathematics & Statistics,,,,"statistics,data,quantitative research",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Karin Warren,1660,Professor,Karen Berger,2876,Associate Professor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8372/0830_Warren_0765.pdf,,,
Analysis of the Integration of Sustainability in Professional Hospitality Education Curriculum,"The research presented in this proposal analyzes the education system of hospitality and culinary educational institutions in America. The goal of the research was to evaluate the need for sustainability in the culinary and hospitality industry, the discrepancy (if any) of sustainability education for culinary/hospitality students, and the recommendations of industry and educational professionals for the integration of sustainability in hospitality education. The proposal answers the question 'is there a need for the integration of sustainability education in hospitality/culinary educational institutions, and if so, what is the best way to integrate sustainability into the curricula?' Analysis for the proposal includes both primary and secondary research. Primary research consists of discussions with industry professionals and faculty members regarding their professional viewpoints and experiences. Secondary research includes review of literature covering sustainable education and integrated curriculum. The subject of this proposal has not yet been covered in published literature. The hospitality industry is worldwide and prides itself on keeping up to date with trends and focusing its efforts on servicing the needs and wants of its consumers and guests. This proposal establishes that these trends and the needs/wants of guests and professionals in the industry include sustainability. Hospitality is not only a unique field, but it also has a unique educational curriculum, lending itself to innovation in higher education when sustainability is a necessary discipline to integrate.",8264,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,"Recreation, Leisure, & Tourism",,,,"hospitality,sustainability across the curriculum",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Rose Spickler,8264,Faculty, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9422/1430_Spickler_0763.pdf,,,
What if They're Right: Teaching and Responding to Climate Change in the Classroom,"Our course, What If They're Right? Individual Responses to Climate Change, addressed, through both philosophical and scientific lenses, responses to climate change in order to empower students to better respond to the challenges this world requires. In response to the UN Sustainable Development goals, students identified specific actions they could take and then to put those actions into practice. Students presented their successes, and importantly, their failures. Projects included going vegan, not using plastic water bottles, or commuting via bicycle instead of by car. Students discussed the challenges these changes in lifestyle provoked, from a general sense of well-being to quantifiable metrics such as energy and CO2 reduction. While many courses focus on the science of climate change, we chose to teach the course with the assumption, following documented science, that climate change is anthropogenic and there exist practical, achievable ways to combat it. This allowed us to introduce the concept of response-ability, and not waste valuable class time discussing the obvious-that they are right! Our main result was a more engaged student-philosophically, scientifically, politically, and socially-who is not alienated by their fear of the problem, and who not only learns about environmental stewardship from a number of (sometimes contradictory) points of view, but also is able to thoughtfully respond with individual and community scale action.",6111,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,,"climate change,sustainability courses",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Tom Stone,6111,Associate Professor of Mathematics and Physics,Nico Jenkins,6111,Asst Professor of Philosophy, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7923/0830_Stone_0347.pdf,,,
Current Issues in Online Sustainability Education,"Explore the challenges and opportunities to developing active online learning (OL) spaces that engage learners in collaborative and impactful ways. For sustainability curriculum, OL can offer multiple ways of learning and supporting interaction, collaboration, and shared learning - key elements to developing engaged and action-oriented students and graduates. Review highlights of research in this topic and offer suggestions for future work in the field. Highlights will include: a review of sustainability learning goals; online collaboration; learning management systems and associated learning tools interoperability and Open Educational Resource issues; tools for engaging learners as leaders; what Massive Open Online Courses can offer; and, the importance of accessibility in online active learning. Together, these should help to streamline instructional design elements and provide a systems approach to learning and practicing sustainability.

Digital Tools to Enhance Integrative Learning and Global Perspectives in Sustainability Studies,"Teaching Sustainability Studies with a focus on problem solving and from a global perspective can be limited by confinement to a classroom at a single location. Here, I show how the use of digital pedagogies can move students beyond the classroom and provide them with experiential, integrative learning opportunities. These same technologies also allow students to develop important skills for work in the field of sustainability. I will both demonstrate and provide assessments of the following tools. Twitter connects students directly to sources of rapidly advancing research particularly in relation to policy and NGOs, and Pocket and Zotero are tools that can organize that information. StoryMapJS allows students to visually and spatially explore a particular issue, and make connections among geographically distinct sustainability projects that are addressing similar problems. 'Domain of One's Own' provides students agency as they experiment on their own web site with potential opportunity for their work to have real impact. It promotes integrative learning as students organize and link multiple assignments that approach sustainable problem solving from different perspectives. Because their work is in the public sphere, student domains provide for greater ownership and allow them to develop actions and solutions in support of a particular problem.",3697,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,,"learning tools,digital tools,technology",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Richard Niesenbaum,3697,Professor and Director of Sustainability Studies, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8069/0830_Niesenbaum_0490.ppt,,,
Mathematics for Sustainability: A New General Education Course and Textbook,"Would you rather learn the quadratic equation or would you rather save the world? For many students in non-technical majors, college algebra or a related course serves as their (frequently dreaded) 'final math course.' Mathematics for Sustainability is a new 'capstone' general education math course offered at Penn State that engages students in a quantitative approach to sustainability questions. Students are introduced to sophisticated mathematical ideas in a context requiring minimal mathematical background, build their skills in quantitative reasoning, and are empowered in using quantitative arguments as effective advocates for issues that they care about. We view quantitative reasoning as part of a broader set of essential skills for citizens who are prepared to be engaged in sustainability questions and we develop mathematical topics in the course with this purpose in mind. These include: basic computations using units; estimation and precision; communicating quantitative information in relevant terms; logical fallacies and the misleading use of quantitative information; computations involving energy and power; dynamic equilibria and the energy balance of the Earth; feedbacks and tipping points in ecosystem models; homophily in social networks; the bystander effect; models of exponential and logistic growth; risk and uncertainty; bayesian inference; game theory; and mechanisms for resolving the tragedy of the commons such as a carbon fee and dividend program.",4190,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,Mathematics & Statistics,,,,"quantitative research,mathematics,general education,sustainability courses",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Russ deForest,4190,Lecturer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Theory is Cheap. Practice is Hard: Bringing Sustainability to First-Year Composition Curricula,"This session explores the ways that sustainability compels a radical rethinking of first-year composition (FYC) pedagogy. Building on Inoue's (2014) rethinking of labor and assessment in the FYC class, Morton's (2013) development of the concept 'hyperobjects,' and Bennett's (2009) thinking on the political ecology of everyday objects, this presentation will offer both sustainability-infused outcomes and suggested assignments for the FYC class. Currently, if sustainability has a place in an FYC class, then it is as a reading or writing subject. That is, FYC's contribution to sustainability is to get students to read, write, and think about sustainability. Of course, there is nothing wrong with that. In fact, it is often valuable and productive. However, this thematic approach too often reinforces nascent or naive views of sustainability: it's all about the environment or recycling; it's good/bad for the economy; it's left/right wing and does/does not fit with my political worldview. To give sustainability a chance to effectively take hold as a productive worldview, FYC curricula must offer students the opportunity to work through the ideas that comprise sustainability. As we know, sustainability is not an end in itself; rather, it is a way of conceiving and producing an equitable future.This session will look at three specific ideas that, in part, form the idea 'sustainability': life-cycle thinking (the notion that the objects in our material world have a life before and after their interaction with us), coexistence (the notion that we exist together in communities with specific and finite resources), ecological thinking (the notion that we are connected to the world around us in ways beyond our everyday comprehension). For each concept, this presentation will offer concrete outcome language and specific assignments designed to encourage meeting those ends.",7987,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,,"composition,sustainability courses,first year experience",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Joseph Burzynski,7987,Assistant Professor of English, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Decolonizing a College's Farm-to-Table Dinner,"This interactive workshop will explore how Whiteness and other form of dominant social power structures can be inadvertently reproduced within farm-to-table events when embedded assumptions in regards to the program, the menu, the entertainment, and the event logistics are left unexamined. The Farm-to-Table Dinner on the Quad at UNC Asheville provides a springboard for discussion about the ways in which social justice concerns can be highlighted without detracting from a positive and festive atmosphere. Farm-to-Table Dinners typically involve a wide range of partners and stakeholders, as they seek to build community and strengthen ongoing relationship. In this workshop, a number of non-traditional partnerships will be presented that have helped to bring social justice concerns into the foreground and allow for deeper self-reflection by participants. By examining embedded assumptions within concepts of 'local' and 'sustainable' as a community, we can help to actively deconstruct racism and other oppressive structure and advance critique social justice movements. Participants will be led through a series of exercises in which they will consider how Whiteness and related power structures have and continue to influence the design and implementation of farm-to-table programs on college campuses and explore how conscious planning can address these issues more effectively.",4237,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,Food & Dining,,,,,"farm-to-table,social justice,inclusion",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Sonia Marcus,4237,Director of Sustainability,Shannon Bodeau,4237,Student Sustainability Staff, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8218/1130_Marcus_0615.pdf,,,
Environmental Social Justice's Role in the Sustainable Development Goals,"At the University of Arizona campus, the Environmental Social Justice (SoJo) committee of the student government-sponsored program Students for Sustainability works on projects that raise awareness for environmental justice issues; promote inclusivity and solidarity in sustainability projects; and bring together environmental and social justice activism. This case study will focus on three things: sharing how the committee's projects relate to the SDG's, help students from other schools to think of ideas for addressing the SDG's within their schools using collaboration between other cultures and communities and highlight how all seventeen of the SDG's relate to environmental social justice. The showcased projects will include: a project that brings together the cultural centers on campus around gardening and dialogue around land and food, an outreach project that creates meaningful programming for the homeless community in Tucson; and a panel series project that strengthened the relationships with the cultural centers about how sustainability and environmentalism is prevalent in all cultures. These projects connect the University of Arizona to being committed to the SDG's as they focus on Reduced Inequalities, Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions and Partnership for the Goals by collaborating with cultural centers and hearing all sides of sustainability in a non-biased, collaborative way.",4465,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),environmental justice,social justice",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Rebecca Van Rhee,4465,Undergraduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Turbulent Winds: Addressing 'Climate' at the Intersections of Diversity and Sustainability,"This session explores the intersection between diversity and sustainability efforts within two California State University campuses. Beginning with a focus on the forces that divide the sustainability and diversity communities, we will share examples of the development of joint initiatives that bring these two areas together through the Sharp/Neumann Model - Awakening, Pioneering, and Transformation. Using the model as a guide, each campus will define where they are now, where they are headed, and some of the challenges encountered along the way. This session should particularly benefit diversity and sustainability officers, student affairs, and faculty and university administrators that are interested in understanding the developmental model related to social/environmental justice, which supports the success of both diversity and sustainability. As the nation's largest and most affordable public four-year university system, the California State University (CSU) (23 institutions with over 400,000 students), is one of the most ethnically and racially diverse university systems in the United States. More than one third entering freshmen are first generation within their families to attend college and sixty percent of CSU students are people of color.

"Integrating Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Into Higher Ed Sustainability Work","Better understanding, supporting, and addressing social sustainability work in higher ed is paramount in creating institutions that welcome and nurture intellectual and personal growth among a diverse campus community. The Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Committee of the AASHE Advisory Council invites attendees to join this networking meeting for a discussion on the challenges and opportunities for integrating diversity and inclusion into sustainability offices. This meeting will be structured with a short introduction from the Committee about our group and work, followed by table talks. At each table attendees can have an open dialogue/brainstorm about how they can progress the work of diversity, equity, and inclusion in their unique institutional setting.

Developing and Utilizing a Social Justice Lens in Order to Achieve Global Goals for Sustainability,"As evidenced by this national moment, a lack of critical understanding of social justice (SJ) issues makes achieving global sustainability goals near impossible. Conversely, thoughtful attention to SJ issues affords any individual or organization the capacity to rise to the challenge of complex global work across lines of race, gender, class and disability (to name a few). More specifically, doing sustainability work through a SJ lens supports the urgent need for national and global collaboration with respect to climate, environmental and sustainability issues and greatly improves the likelihood of the development of deeply rooted and long-term climate, environmental and sustainability solutions. As such, this cross-disciplinary workshop is designed to take campus sustainability work to a deeper level, via the use of a critical 'social justice lens' (SJL), so as to improve its efficacy, deepen its reach and power, and ultimately align it more closely with 21st century climate realities. Based on workshops Dr. Hackman has presented across the country, this interactive session begins by setting forth the core components of a critical SJL, then makes explicit connections for its use and transformative import in this current climate change / sustainability moment, and concludes with the presentation of concrete steps regarding the application of a SJL to sustainability work on our campuses.",5108,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,,,,,,social justice,10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Heather Hackman,5108,"Founder and President, Hackman Consulting Group", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
"To Rise, We Need Critical Conversations About 'Unsustainable' Race, Class & Gender Privilege ","While attention to the ways dynamics of racism, classism and gender oppression target people of color and native people, poor and working class people, and cisgender women and trans* people is critically important to our sustainability work, too often the 'other side' of these dynamics are left invisible and thus unchallenged and unchanged. More specifically, while some campuses are willing to consider the impacts of racism, sexism or classism on their sustainability work, less frequent is the willingness to look at the ways white, owning-class and male privilege has impacted that work. This workshop is designed to help participants dive more deeply into the complicated and often fraught conversation about race, class and gender privilege in the service of developing more collaborative campus sustainability efforts. To be sure this is not a session mired in guilt, shame and blame, and instead: 1) level-sets a shared understanding of how systems of oppression work and their impacts on climate change, environmental issues and sustainability work, 2) explores, through a social justice lens, the dynamics of privilege inherent in all of these systems of oppression, 3) identifies the unconscious and unintentional ways race, class and gender privilege thwart collective sustainability work on our campuses, 4) suggests ways to interrupt and dismantle these privileged dynamics.",5108,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"social justice,privilege,race & ethnicity,gender",10/5/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Heather Hackman,5108,"Founder and President, Hackman Consulting Group", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
"An Introduction to the Role of Race, Class and Gender Issues on Campus Sustainability Work","This introductory session explores the powerfully important ways that dynamics of race, class and gender (RCG) impact the efficacy of our campus sustainability work, and then suggests how a racial justice, economic justice, and gender justice framework can substantially deepen that very same work. The session begins with a brief framing of the connection between RCG issues and sustainability, followed by the outlining of a social justice lens that can be used address them. The session utilizes reflective writing, paired discussion and small group conversation to foster participant engagement and is best suited for those with very little understanding of social justice issues.",5108,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"social justice,privilege,race & ethnicity,gender",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Heather Hackman,5108,"Founder and President, Hackman Consulting Group", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Food and Housing Security Among NC State Students,"The UN Sustainable Development Goals provide a comprehensive framework for approaching sustainability from a global perspective. The goals are also incredibly relevant for higher education not only in teaching, research and operations but in how we address these sustainability challenges in our own student populations. Food and housing security for college students is an issue that speaks to the complexities of the SGD's as well as the interconnected approaches needed to make positive impacts. Today, many college students struggle to secure stable housing and adequate food despite working one or more jobs and taking out loans. Rising tuition and increased food and housing costs have dramatically outpaced slight increases in tuition aid. Food and housing insecurity are immense barriers to academic success. Because they spend a great deal of their time trying to find food and secure housing, students who are hungry and lack safe and stable housing are at risk of academic failure. There are many valuable campus & community resources currently available to students but most campuses are lacking a comprehensive approach to basic needs security. At NC State, a group of committed faculty, staff, and administrators, along with key community leaders, began collaborating to make progress on food and housing security. The vision for the project is: All NC State students will have access to sufficient, nutritious, culturally appropriate, and affordable food & safe, affordable housing.",3655,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,"food security,housing",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Lindsay Batchelor,3655,Sustainability Program Development Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8148/1045_Batchelor_0548.pptx,,,
A New Hope: Training Social Sustainabilistas,"In past AASHE presentations, our office highlighted how we weave social sustainability into our hiring, training, outreach, and planning efforts. This time, our focus will be the ways we implement social sustainability training in our internship program and how our strategies have evolved over time. From their first day in the office until their last, we expose our intern team to social sustainability concepts and the importance of holistically looking at issues through a just lens. While the majority of our focus is on social justice issues, we have recently expanded our training to include financial, physical, and mental wellness. Training strategies include formal presentations from office staff, field trips, attending campus events, bringing in outside speakers, informal office conversations, weekly social media assignments, research, documentaries, reflection opportunities, encouraging social sustainability topics in their outreach efforts, and most importantly interns learning from each other's experience and knowledge. After sharing our training strategies, we will ask the audience to share their methods and ideas to further the conversation.",7982,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"social justice,internships",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Ben Kalscheur,7982,Sustainability Assistant Manager,Kelly Wellman,7982,Sustainability Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8365/1400_Kalscheur_0756.pdf,,,
Moving Past Tokenization: Integrating Social Equity Internally and Programmatically,"What does environmental justice programming really look like in higher education? How do we avoid tokenization of marginalized groups within the environmental movement and move beyond buzzwords such as diversity and inclusion? Hear from students and staff from UC Berkeley on how they are integrating environmental justice programs within the Student Environmental Resource Center. The Student Environmental Resource Center (SERC), at the University of California, Berkeley, is a collaborative space to strengthen the collective effectiveness of the sustainability community, and provides resource for students to actualize their vision of a more equitable, socially just, and resilient future. Since its creation in 2012, SERC has aimed to provide in-depth educational, social, professional, and financial opportunities and programs for students at UC Berkeley. Inspired by the work of the Students of Color Environmental Collective at UC Berkeley, SERC has aimed to be provide better environmental justice resources and programs for the UC Berkeley campus community. In this session, student and staff panelists will present on the following programs and resources that SERC has adopted and developed to address the growing demands for more integration of social and environmental justice programs and resources on campus: 1) The hiring of an environmental justice associate 2) the launch of an environmental justice resource page and folder 3) the Decolonize the Environment workshop series.",4473,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"environmental justice,social justice,race & ethnicity,tokenism",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Sharon Daraphonhdeth,4473,"Director, Student Environmental Resource Center",Andrea Luna,4473,"Student, Environmental Justice Associate", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7900/1130_Luna_0317.pptx,,,
Increasing Diversity in a Sustainability Internship Program,"Institutionalized forms of oppression such as racism, sexism, and homophobia are embedded throughout our society. One of the many ways that this materializes is in the hiring process and in the way we structure our programs. We grow up with media images, messages in the news, comments from strangers, from family, from friends that all reinforce these stereotypes and biases often times unintentionally. To overcome these biases, we have to educate ourselves, reflect, engage in diverse spaces, call ourselves out, and be called out every day of our lives. Even if we are able to overcome these implicit biases, hiring typically relys on tools such as resumes, which often reflect privilege more than the potential of a student. Over the past thirteen years of managing the UCSB Sustainability Program, I have been able to identify a set of strategies that have made a meaningful impact on the diversity of our program. The strategies that will be discussed represent many different approaches, attempts, successes, and failures over the years. We have taken the internship program through several significant restructuring phases, each time addressing a different barrier to bringing in a diverse group of interns. We have also taken a careful look at our advertising and recruitment processes to ensure that we have a broader applicant pool. Each time, we complete interviews, we pay careful attention to which criteria and considerations are the most common barriers to access.",4169,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"internships,cultural & racial diversity,hiring practices",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Katie Maynard,4169,Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
What About Accessibility? The Intersection of Sustainability and Accessibility on College Campuses,"In 2013, the United Nations defined accessibility as '... an inherent right that benefits all. It is not derived from special legislation; nor is it a concern solely to persons due a condition, for instance disability, or demographic cohort, for instance older persons.'* Given the UN's emphasis on expanding inclusivity through both direct action and supporting universal design, we feel this topic is relevant to this year's focus of the AASHE conference and therefore we ask the following question... As we create more sustainable campuses, how can we ensure that everyone benefits from sustainability initiatives, projects, and programs on college and university campuses? In this panel, we would like to begin a discussion about where and how sustainability and accessibility initiatives work together and intersect in meaningful ways in higher education. While the conversation is open to all ideas and viewpoints, we invite you to consider the following questions during this panel: 1. We are often in positions of overseeing high-budget sustainability projects that make significant campus change. Does your department currently have a relationship with the disabled community on campus? What are some options to open communication? 2. Are there any projects that can advance accessibility through sustainable means? 3. Have you had any projects unintentionally conflict with accessibility needs? If so, what are some lessons you learned from the experience?",1541,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,,,,,,disabilities,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Sarah Koning,1541,Program Development,Joanne Moliski,1541,Graduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Addressing Collegiate Basic Needs Through the Sustainability Lens,"Addressing the basic needs of student populations is a fast growing and important topic on College and University campuses. Collegiate basic needs encompasses food and housing security, financial education and wellness, crisis prevention, and the emotional, mental and physical health of our student populations, But what do these areas of student need have to do with University sustainability policy? In this 30 minute session we will discuss how the University of Pittsburgh has woven the discussion of collegiate basic needs into the overall discussion of University sustainability. We will explore how this approach has helped us to address areas of equity and access on campus and the specific sustainability projects and initiatives that we utilize to meet and elevate these student needs. Participants will learn about the evolution of the CBN framework on the Pitt campus and how student directed projects such as the Pitt Pantry, Pitt Food Share and the University of Thriftsburgh have closed the circle between basic student needs and sustainability.",760,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,basic needs,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Erika Ninos,760,Sustainability Program Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

Sustainability Best Practices to Contain the Uncontainable: Lessons Learned From UVA & August 11/12,"UVA's responses to the white supremacist rallies at UVA and Charlottesville during the summer of 2017 can serve as an example to other institutions as white supremacy and violence on campuses becomes a growing concern across the nation. Through several lessons learned from UVA, this session will begin a dialogue on the institutional policy changes, actions, and community engagement best practices sustainability professionals can use to facilitate positive community development on their campuses during times of crises. To this aim, the session will situate the University's Civic Engagement Sustainability Committee's efforts to bolster 'sustainable' recovery within the historical context of complex race relations (slavery & white supremacy) and the institutional response to 'August 11/12.' Key initiatives that this session will highlight: MLK Event: Healing Through Art & Community with Candy Chang; Rebuilding Stronger: Roundtable Discussion with Happy Johnson; Equity & Environment Fund; Sustainability Student Leadership Summit.

Engaging Students and Low-Income Community Members: Successes in Conservation and Social Equity,"The FLOWS program (Foundation for Leaders Organizing for Water and Sustainability), is made up of diverse CU Boulder Environmental Center student staff and historically marginalized community members that team up to do energy and water upgrades in low-income housing, build community around sustainability efforts, and provide green job trainings. FLOWS provides culturally-relevant, hands-on water, energy, and climate education through a social justice lens. Through our efforts we have been able to not just help mitigate climate footprints and lower water and energy bills for low-income residents, but create green job trainings, provide stipends, generate input for the city's climate action plan, and create a replicable framework so that other schools and communities can implement similar programs. In this session, we'll talk about the evolution of our energy and water programs into 'Energy and Climate Justice Programs,' how we started the FLOWS program, and some best practices we believe make it so successful.

Think Outside: Educating about Conservation and Race in the Great Outdoors,"We need multi-lateral participation to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined by the UN; however, the narrative of environmental protection, and the subsequent sustainability movement, is dominated by a 'white' ethic that unintentionally limits the participation of non-white racial communities in environmentally related action and activities (Finney, 2016). In order to prepare a society ready to engage with multi-lateral stakeholders, educators must better incorporate discussions of inequality and power into conservation curriculum. This session walks through a Fall Break service-learning program designed to engage students in practices of land stewardship while simultaneously exploring racial power dynamics in the environmental rhetoric. Specific attention will be paid to Pennsylvania's Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) Think Outside initiative where we will hear from the chair of DCNR's diversity committee. We will then discuss service-learning pedagogy to engage students in hands on learning and reflection. This service-learning program is designed to engage students in SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and is made possible by DCNR's Think Outside program.

Building Relationships Between Sustainability Offices and Diversity Offices,"Sustainability offices and diversity offices have a lot in common - both in our roles and in our subject matter. Both offices are change agents, frequently struggling against the same kinds of resistance. In subject matter, the historical roots of current environmental problems have a lot of overlap with the roots of inequality, and any lasting solution to one requires a solution to the other. There are compelling reasons for sustainability offices and diversity offices to collaborate, but building that bridge can be a challenge. The Zilkha Center for Environmental Initiatives at Williams College (our sustainability office) and the Davis Center (our center for social identity, inclusion and activism) have had an active and productive collaboration for years, including periodic joint staff meetings, strategic planning, and joint programming. That relationship was purposely developed over time, and this session will address how sustainability offices can follow a similar path. The session will cover four steps in building such a relationship: self-education, being a good ally/accomplice, building personal relationships and initiating joint programming.

Step Changes in Climate Action: Data-Driven Plans to Decarbonize Campus Energy Systems,"Answering the call to address the climate crisis is one of the central themes of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Colleges and universities have been working to deploy energy efficient, net zero energy, and Living Building Challenge buildings on their campuses for a number of years to help meet their greenhouse gas reduction goals. However, many are now looking to develop date specific and dynamic decarbonization plans that examine how a campus can achieve fossil-fuel freedom through the total transformation of their energy systems. This effort to move towards real-time data-driven decision-making marks a cutting-edge development in energy planning on campuses. In this session, Dano Weisbord from Smith College and Laura Draucker from Amherst College will discuss the reasons behind their pursuit of holistic energy system transformations to achieve carbon neutrality, and how they both partnered with Integral Group to develop an innovative plan to meet our goals. They will also speak to how the plans are currently being implemented on their campuses, and their efforts to infuse the results of the decarbonization planning efforts into the curriculum on campus and into individual behavioral decisions by faculty, staff and students.

So You've Got Energy Meters - Now what? Dealing With the Other Challenges to Getting Energy Data,"It's hard to manage what you don't measure, and this is especially true with energy. We are strong believers in the role energy data analysis plays in helping us identify and prioritize projects, track progress, engage students, and drive behavior change. In an effort to act on this, we have also learned the hard way that it is never as simple as getting the funding and installing meters. While we have all seen great presentations on the benefits of metering, none of us were prepared for the additional questions and challenges that come with a metering project. Should you do them all at once or start small? Are your old meters collecting the right data or do they need to be replaced? Should you meter steam? Where does the data go and who has access to it? Do you want the data stored in the cloud or a server? Is the data real time? Who is even leading this project - facilities, sustainability, IT? If you are considering adding meters to campus, join us for an opportunity to learn from our mistakes and successes. If you have meters and have experiences you also want to share, please join us as well.

Reduce Peak Demand and Increase Grid Stability With On-Site Energy Storage,"The Austin Community College District (ACC) has installed a 72kW energy storage system on their Eastview campus. The grant funded battery project, known as Sustainable and Holistic Integration of Energy Storage (SHINES) was paid for by the Department of Energy and a competitive site selection process was managed through the local utility: Austin Energy. In this presentation we will discuss onsite energy storage as a viable option for higher education facilities, overall objectives and project goals, construction concerns, realized benefits, and answer questions. The Eastview campus was selected to host the SHINES Energy Storage System in part because of ACC's commitment to utilize this cutting edge battery system for education as well as site specific elements such as the campus' location in a growing part of town and a preexisting 100.8kW roof-mounted solar array. Energy storage mitigates the risk of a utility outage by supplying power during peak usage times to reduce the facility's burden on the grid and is a potential solution to the grid stability disadvantage caused by the intermittency and variability of other energy sources, such as solar production. The SHINES project attempts to demonstrate a solution adaptable to any region and market structure. Results, including daily output graphs showing the peak-shaving capabilities of the battery capacity and management software, will also be discussed.",2066,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,,,,,,energy storage,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Caleb Crow,2066,Sustainability Staff,Andy Kim,2066,"Director, Energy & Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8164/0830_Crow_0568.pdf,,,

This new fuel, called Renewable Fuel Oil, has an extremely low carbon lifecycle emissions profile. The fuel is cheaper than natural gas, and because it is a liquid fuel, is much easier to retrofit compared to other biomass-based solutions. It has been an integral part of the College's ability to make large strides towards our Carbon Neutrality pledge of 2020.

Estimating the financial feasibility and technical potential for solar PV on all U.S. schools,"In 2016, approximately 64% of total electricity generated in the United States came from fossil fuel sources, while approximately 2% came from solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation. Due to this mostly fossil fuel dependent electricity portfolio, electricity generation accounts for approximately 35% of total U.S. carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions each year. Solar PV can significantly reduce emissions of CO2 and other harmful pollutants such as PM2.5, which have asymmetric negative effects for at-risk populations such as asthmatics, the elderly, and low-income families. According to the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) database, educational institutions account for 11% of total U.S. building electricity consumption and 14% of building floorspace - as a result, they contribute to approximately 4% of total U.S. CO2 emissions. Therefore, we wish to estimate the reductions in the emissions of CO2, PM2.5, SO2, and NOX and their associated avoided damages by installing solar PV on educational institutions throughout the United States. In previous work, we described a method for estimating the technical potential of solar PV on educational institutions using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data for 29% of all of the U.S. schools. Using only those estimates, we found a total technical potential of 12 GW and 19 TWh/yr, covering 0.1 billion m2 of rooftop space and serving 25 million students and teachers in associated facilities. In this paper, we perform a benefit-cost analysis (BCA) at the school-level for various scenarios to address these research questions: 1.        What are the total annualized lifetime cost and benefits - both private and public - of installing today rooftop solar PV systems on all U.S. educational institutions today? 2.        How sensitive are BCA results to the following inputs: (1) discount rate, (2) value of excess generation, (3) financing (i.e. third party ownership options), and (4) value of mitigated damages?",2849,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,,,,,,solar,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Inês Azevedo,2849,Professor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

"The Upgrade Alternative: When Energy Upgrades Prove Cost Prohibitive, Microgrids Offer Another Path","K-12 and higher education systems across the U.S. and beyond often struggle to upgrade or install energy efficient HVAC and other energy equipment in the face of shrinking budgets, escalating electricity bills and aging infrastructure. A program introduced by The Hawaii Department of Education offers a solution for schools and institutions worldwide who are wrestling with similar economic pressures. In response to a $1.6 billion campus air conditioning installation shortfall, the Hawaii Department of Education found a game-changing solution in microgrids. The capital cost of implementing microgrids with roof-top PV+storage together with split system A/C units to cool individual classrooms proved to be substantially lower than traditional central air systems. Plus, having on-site energy storage and flexibility in programming the power electronics allowed schools to keep their current energy costs and energy access stable while maintaining grid-connection for backup power. Looking at the Hawaii case study and beyond, this session will examine how creating distributed microgrid assets that spare the cost of infrastructure upgrades and reduce energy costs month-over-month can offer a new avenue to improved operations, sustainability and long term energy resiliency for the education sector. Beyond a compelling economic case, the session will also touch on the added benefit of microgrids in helping to insulate colleges and universities from grid instability and lack of availability in times of natural disaster or other crises.",8354,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,,,,,,"microgrids,disaster & emergency response",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Catherine Von Burg,8354,CEO and President, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9600/1430_VonBurg_0966.pdf,,,

Rising to Meet the Challenge of 100% Renewable Energy,"Campuses are increasingly looking to renewable energy as the most financially attractive strategy for making dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieving their GHG goals. The costs of renewables has dropped significantly and, as a result, campuses are rapidly adopting onsite solar. While onsite solar is highly visible, it is rarely sufficient to meet GHG goals. This workshop covers a portfolio of approaches that can be part of a comprehensive strategy. Specifically, this workshop will: - provide a process for campuses to identify strategies appropriate to their size, location, and energy context - outline key considerations for executing a comprehensive renewable energy strategy - review case studies from three campuses targeting 100% renewables with three different sets of challenges and opportunities. Topics will include: - on-campus solar sites; community solar; offsite projects, including regulated and deregulated markets, and out-of-state solutions; aggregating to achieve scale; stakeholder management; academic integration.",2869,2246,5184,,,,,Energy,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"renewable energy,solar",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Rob Andrejewski,2869,Director of Sustainability,Dennis Carlberg,2246,Sustainability Director,Christen Blum,5184,Managing Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7874/0830_Carlberg_0290.pptx,,,
A Billion Dollar Deal: Public-Private Energy Partnership Advances Campus Effort Beyond Efficiency,"In July 2017, Ohio State launched an innovative approach to sustainably manage its building energy use, in a manner that will provide significant energy management knowledge and financial capital back to the university to further the university's academic and sustainability goals. Through a 50 year, $1.165 billion lease agreement, the university has transferred the operation of its energy delivery assets to Ohio State Energy Partners (OSEP), a private sector entity consisting of energy industry experts. One portion of this agreement requires OSEP to make the university's Columbus campus buildings 25% more energy efficient within a decade. In addition, OSEP will invest $150 million back into the university to help achieve the university's academic and sustainability goals, including student scholarships and internships, faculty and curriculum endowments, sustainability fund endowment, annual philanthropic giving, and a new visionary project to advance energy-related innovations from the research lab to the private sector market. This creative management agreement creates new financial resources for the university without creating bonded debt.

Getting to 100% Renewable Electricity,"Colorado State University (CSU) signed the Climate Reality Pledge in January 2017 - pledging to achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2030. Since electricity is responsible for ~50% of CSU's GHG footprint, this aligned well with CSU's existing ACUPCC pledge and goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The University of Denver (DU) has committed to 5% onsite renewables and 20% offsite renewables by 2025, with an interim goal of 24% GHG reduction by 2020, on the way to carbon neutrality by 2050. Even before all these commitments were made, university staff at both institutions have been working toward achieving these goals. Easy? Not easy? Some US states have 'retail choice' - where customers can choose their electricity provider. Colorado is not one of those states. Our electricity provider is determined strictly by geography - customers are stuck with the utility that serves that location - and with that utility's generation 'mix'. How do we get to 100% renewable electricity when: 1) the current mix is about mostly coal 2) we lack retail choice and 3) we intend to take physical delivery of the renewable electricity? This session will cover the paths taken, the bridges crossed and the chasms yet to span. In spite of barriers, throughout 2018, CSU and DU will be actively pursuing our ambitious renewable electricity goals - and may have success to report and share. Let's talk!

Scaling UP Renewable Energy Beyond Campus,"The Paris Agreement (at the moment) represents civilizations best path forward for global action and accountability of our collective reduction in harmful greenhouse gas emissions. What happens when a significant player backs away? The 'We are still in' movement has captured the attention of a broad coalition of parties committed to the Paris Agreement, specifically, the United States Climate Alliance. New York State is a committed member. New York State, also, has a large number of Colleges and Universities with firm commitments for Climate Action. Through grassroots networking and mutual goals, the New York Campus Aggregate Renewable Energy Solutions (NYCARES) coalition is in the process of pooling our need and our resources for a large portion of New York State's Commitment to supporting the Paris Agreement. This session will explore key milestones of developing the public / private partnership, garnering both internal and external institutional support, risk assessment, economies of scale beyond a single owner / buyer, and other legal / contractual aspects of Large Scale Renewable Energy (LSRE) development.

Transforming Our Tomorrow - A New Clean Energy Vision,"Whenever, I run into a problem I can't solve, I always make it bigger. I can never solve it by trying to make it smaller, but if I make it big enough I can begin to see the outlines of a solution.' This wise counsel from President Dwight D. Eisenhower, helped us rethink our approach to achieving our clean energy goals and provided us with a new frame that is beginning to demonstrate how we can scale climate change mitigation efforts to provide maximum impact both on our campus and beyond. The Localizing our Renewable Energy Future initiative--spearheaded by the University at Buffalo--aims to invest in the region while reducing energy costs for a who's who of Buffalo-area anchoring institutions (City of Buffalo, Erie County, University at Buffalo, Buffalo State College, and SUNY Erie Community College). The effort is also working to help save taxpayer dollars while creating more efficient budgeting for the participating institutions. There are three specific objectives that are being addressed: 1) The establishment of 100 new megawatts of renewable energy--enough to provide 50% of clean energy needs for participating partners, mostly in the form of solar power, by 2020. 2) The creation of clean energy student engagement space for curricular and experiential learning activities as well as sustainability oriented groups on campus and local non-profits focused on clean energy. 3) Expanding our clean energy curriculum and creating the next generation of clean energy.",1306,5184,,,,,,Energy,,,,,,,"renewable energy,solar",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Tonga Pham,1306,Associate Vice President for University Facilities,Christen Blum,5184,Managing Director,Ryan McPherson,1306,Chief Sustainability Officer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7856/0915_McPherson_0278.pptx,,,
The Impact of Real-time Visual Feedback on Electric Consumption at Middlebury College,"The typical associations with 'energy efficiency' are production oriented. However, in order to make a meaningful impact, these innovative production solutions need to be matched equally with creative ways to reduce consumption (SDG #12: 'Responsible Consumption and Production'). In a world of global connectedness, the only indication of electric use to the average consumer is in the form of a bill at the end of the month. For college students, even that small notion is lost, severing all connection between behavior and ecological impact. The first step to bridging this gap in institutions of higher education is transparency around resource consumption. In three buildings (12 townhouse apartments) at Middlebury College, LED strips were installed to provide residents with real-time feedback on their current electric usage, as compared to a baseline. The creative design behind this project is a prime example of interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together students, faculty in three departments, and facilities staff members. Moreover, the design of the device does not rely on a third-party, meaning that it can be morphed for applications in countless other sustainability projects across campus (e.g., an alert system to reduce peak loads, building competitions, art installations showing all-campus consumption). In addition to the strength of the learning model, the LED strips have significantly changed the way that the residents engage with electric consumption.",532,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,,,"behavior change,energy reduction",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Thomas Wentworth,532,Undergraduate Student,John Byrne,532,"Director, Office of Sustainability Integration", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8088/0830_Wentworth_0512.pdf,,,
Creating a Successful Campus Temperature Policy,"Heating and cooling account for more than 60% of Wesleyan's energy and carbon footprint. In 2013, Wesleyan's Utilities Manager estimated that we could reduce our energy consumption 20%, or approximately $1.6 million, through basic conservation measures. To address this, Wesleyan established its first Energy Conservation Policy, which identified target temperature ranges in campus buildings. Four years in, we have seen great success, including decreases in energy consumption and greater buy-in campus-wide for energy conservation. The foci of the policy are: 1. Reducing the environmental impact of Wesleyan through energy conservation makes us a more responsible steward of the planet's resources. This reduction in energy usage improves local air quality, global air quality through reduced carbon emissions, and reduced need for natural gas. 2. Wesleyan has spent millions on energy conservation efforts over the past 15 years, but until the policy, very little had been done to invite students and employees to play a role in this process, instead making reduction of energy costs the 'the administration's job.' Energy conservation through this policy allows us to divert utility funding to campus projects that further improve energy efficiency and encourage conservation, as well as to invest in renewable energy. 3. Discomfort issues nullified Wesleyan's past attempts at temperature guidelines. In implementing this policy, we created comfort suggestions and educational materials and worked with each department on campus to ensure their considerations were accounted for in plan development. Wesleyan is one of few schools that have successfully implemented such a policy. Gaining buy-in from our campus president on down that this new policy is 'what we do' at Wesleyan has helped immensely in making this policy culturally successful . This policy has overall been a success on campus with tangible results, decreasing our environmental impact and energy costs.",3771,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,,,"energy conservation,temperature controls",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jennifer Kleindienst,3771,Sustainability Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8994/1430_Kleindienst_0281.pdf,,,
Student-Developed Energy Management Information System,"Like many other educational institutions, our college cares about the efficient use of energy and seeks ways to reduce its impact on the environment. We promote energy-wise behavior among students, faculty, and staff; however, their overall effect is limited. The greater return on investment lies with a handful of people, usually facilities staff. We have realized that using real-time data with the help of an energy management information system (EMIS) can better affect the return for individual projects. This is accomplished by evaluating energy efficiency, forecasting future consumption, detecting abnormal energy use and optimizing overall efficiency. Like all institutions, we have limited financial resources and staff, so we have employed low-cost electricity meters. We struggled with visualizing and leveraging data in a standard spreadsheet program, which provides far less analysis than that of an EMIS; so, we have created a solution to overcome these limitations. As a model of both Urban Sustainability and a Living Laboratory, the Sustainability Office hired a first-year computer science major to develop an interactive web portal featuring various visualizations including a heat map, as well as a tool for automated meter data collection. This solution proved to be an invaluable tool for our energy manager and other facilities staff. Together during this presentation, we will explore the process of creating an interactive and intuitive dashboard.",4603,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"students,energy management,dashboards",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Tomas Panek,4603,Student; Developer at Sustainability Office,Kurt Miller,4603,Sustainability Project Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

Turning Energy Challenges into Solutions at Higher Education Facilities,"While budget cuts and finite resources can often act as hurdles to enacting energy efficiency improvements, these investments can produce long-term and unmatched benefits that significantly reduce overall energy expenses and improve the energy-related equipment, infrastructure, and systems at higher education facilities. Constellation, one of the country's leading energy providers, helps higher education institutions achieve their sustainability goals, develop energy resiliency strategies, and manage their costs and capital expenditure liabilities. Energy efficiency upgrades can generate millions in savings within a single year. Having worked with colleges and universities nationwide including Ohio University, Mercyhurst University, Salem State University, and the University of Maryland, Constellation is uniquely positioned to speak about large-scale, innovative energy overhaul projects. Having overseen many of these projects, Marc Aronson, Senior Business Development Manager, and Bob Belyea, Principal Technical Sales Manager, can discuss how performance-based energy efficiency and sustainability solutions can help higher education facilities address their energy challenges. They will also speak to specific strategies that can assist colleges and universities in improving their current energy utilization.

Paying for Sustainable Development from Wasted Energy,"The World Green Building Council posits that green buildings support nine UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Public-Private Partnerships (P3) have become a popular mechanism for higher education institutions to transform existing infrastructure to green buildings. Outsourcing construction, financial, and operational risks enable higher-ed institutions to upgrade energy infrastructure, lower energy consumption, enhance campus sustainability, and create better learning environments. Financing barriers arise as public higher-ed institutions are often unable or unwilling to invest funds in energy efficiency projects and higher-priority needs demand limited funds. Hence, institutions often seek external financing for these types of projects. However, financial institutions are generally reluctant to provide loans for multiple reasons, such as perceived high-risk energy efficiency projects. The use of public-private partnerships can utilize private-sector financing. In this approach, the customer engages a commercial service provider to design and implement an improvement project with its compensation connected to the performance of the project. Generally some form of performance guarantee (such as a guarantee of energy savings) is provided by the service provider. A few examples of P3 benefits include no upfront capital needed, various financing mechanisms available, project risk displacement, and turnkey service. P3 helps university leadership secure funding, find ongoing support, and align future funding, while engaging students in the project as learning experiences. From a decade of experience at Kutztown and UMass Dartmouth Universities, we will explore the merits of P3 projects that benefit people employed by, and living on, their campus. Two university (Public) and two energy service company (Private) speakers will discuss the impact of their project (Partnership) on students, faculty, staff, and the community as they relate to nine UN SDGs.",2059,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Investment & Finance,,,,,"energy savings performance contracting,public-private partnerships",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Scott Finlinson,2059,"Manager, Green Operations",Deanna McPeak,2059,Program Specialist, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Using Sub-Metering to Prioritize and Measure Energy Management Projects,"Every institution faces limitations as it relates to spending money. These limitations can be on operating budgets, staffing levels, or both. It is paramount while operating within these limits to direct resources towards the most important projects. But how do you know which are the most important? As a result of installing low-cost sub-meters, the College has been able to prioritize energy efficiency projects that have saved considerable funds and millions of kilowatt hours of electricity. Additionally, after a project, the College has been able to use the sub-meter data to verify the effectiveness of each of the projects. This verifications is critical for both processing rebates to utilities as well as tracking our progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Occupant Engagement and Centralized Controls: a Hybrid Energy Management Solution With Major Savings,"Introduction: Plug loads (PL), devices plugged into wall outlets, comprise approximately 1/3 of electricity use of commercial buildings, and are expected to rise to 1/2 by 2030. Traditional PL reduction strategies, such as centralized controls, fail to incorporate the role of building occupants in PL performance. A novel PL management technology (Keewi Inc.) enables occupants to take part in managing their energy use. This study presents results from implementation of socially-driven and centralized PL management at the University of Maryland (College Park, MD). Methods: 171 devices in 42 offices and 76 devices in 4 concessions at the XFINITY Center were plugged into Keewi smart plugs that provided energy monitoring, remote on/off and schedule-based controls. After 78 days of baseline energy data collection for each device, staff in the offices were given access to their personalized energy data through the Keewi mobile app. For 102 days, participants took part in a game of PL energy management with points, rewards and team competitions to reduce energy use. Devices in concessions, on the other hand, were turned off centrally on dark days (intervention period: 36 days) and the average daily base load was calculated. Results: Office occupants using the Keewi app achieved a 32.0% reduction in daily electricity consumption during intervention compared to baseline. Of the 31 participants, 27 showed positive energy savings with Keewi's socially-driven PL management system. During intervention, the median participant logged into the app 21 times and spent 45 minutes on the app. The most active occupants, who spent at least 2 hours on the app, achieved a reduction of 48.7% in their personal energy use. Centralized controls in concessions, on the other hand, reduced average daily base load consumption by 17.2%. Conclusions: This study demonstrates effectiveness of a hybrid strategy with socially-driven and centralized PL management in higher educational facilities.",8283,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,,,occupant engagement,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Hedi Razavi,8283,Co-founder and COO, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10374/1430_Razavi_1099.pdf,,,
How to Benchmark Your Building in Five Minutes or Less,"As a management practice, benchmarking involves tracking building performance by regularly measuring key performance indicators such as energy use and periods of peak and low demand. Benchmarking then compares current performance against past performance, or current performance to that of other similar buildings. Unfortunately, the challenges of benchmarking often get more attention than its many benefits. By energy benchmarking an organization can establish energy reduction targets, identify savings opportunities and stay on budget throughout the year. Lucid Design Group (Lucid) is a software company that works to improve the operational, environmental, and financial performance of building portfolios through the better use of building data. In 2016, Lucid began a collaboration with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) through a small business voucher offered by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the purpose of making energy benchmarking easier and more accessible to facilities/sustainability managers thereby reducing the energy use of buildings on a broad scale. The outcome of this unique collaboration was, Benchmark My Building, a free public-facing energy benchmarking tool that leverages the Energy Star Portfolio Manager (ESPM) and DOE Building Performance databases to allow anyone with internet access to start benchmarking their building(s) and to visualize the value of improving efficiency in terms of dollars and cents.

Campus-Wide Change: Turn Down for Watt,"Northern Michigan University's EcoReps and Facilities Management hosted the first Turn Down the Lights campaign during Sustainability Week in March 2018. During this week, corridor lights were turned off in 14 academic buildings on campus. This amounted to a week long savings of 5,600 kilowatt hours and a financial savings of $700. Outreach took place through campus-wide postings, stickers, and tabeling sessions. 'Why are the hallways dark?' was a common catalyst for discussion on campus. Students and staff not typically reached by campus sustainability programming were directly engaged by this visual representation of institutional energy consumption. If these corridor lights were permanently turned off, this could equate to a savings of $36,000 a year.5,600 kilowatthours were avoided which equates to electricity necessary to run NMU's Heating Plant for approximately 3 days.",3209,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,,,"energy reduction,events",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Marley Redd,3209,EcoReps Intern, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10405/1430_Redd_1104.pdf,,,

Hitting Bumps in the Road to Renewables,"Almost every month it seems like a new renewable energy project is announced on a college campus, feeding a sense of urgency at those colleges and universities who have not yet installed their first solar panel. And, as sustainability-conscious students, faculty and staff increase their calls for climate action in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals ('take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts') and the We Are Still In movement, the pressure is on to implement more green energy projects. However, the road from idea to implementation is not always smooth and sometimes even with support at the highest levels, renewable energy projects fail to come to fruition. We will describe and analyze two examples of renewable energy projects that, despite strong commitment and lots of background work, failed to actually be implemented. The first presenter is from a large, public, research university and the second is from a small, private liberal arts college, allowing comparisons between different funding and organization types. Each presenter will describe the project their institution was hoping to implement, what background work was completed, why the project fell apart, and lessons learned from the process.

University of Houston-Downtown Embraces Student Engagement in Urban Agriculture and Sustainability,"The University of Houston-Downtown has created a Center for Urban Agriculture and Sustainability (CUAS) to support research, teaching and community outreach. The program not only expands the educational opportunities for UHD students but it aims to ultimately improve Houston neighborhoods through the education of the next generation of Houston's leaders. The current initiatives that engage students fall into two categories. Students may submit green project grants for funding and the center typically funds about 10 per year. The second program is a summer experiential learning program where students from different majors work together in teams to plan, build and test a system that builds on the university's sustainable initiatives. Here we highlight two summer projects for the UHD Sustainability Garden - an automated composting system and an aquaponics system. The aquaponics system was developed as a low-cost, small-scale, and observable fish-plant ecosystem that utilizes solar energy for water-flow and can be implemented to reduce food costs and to provide opportunities for the biological and ecological research. Students also designed an automated composting system that mixes compost using solar power so that compost can be made more efficiently from the leftover food from the UHD food court.

As a smaller university BHSU uses about 500 gallons of fuel every year to maintain campus. Over half of that is diesel and could be converted to biofuel. As equipment and vehicles are traded out, purchasing diesel-run equipment will further enhance the impact of this case study. By demonstrating the ease of such a program, we hope to inspire others to utilize cost effective ways to reduce GHG emissions on campus and reduce waste. We have demonstrated an innovative, easily replicable model for other small to mid-sized institutions wishing to reduce waste, costs and environmental impacts. We have successfully shown the university that a biodiesel program would help meet our carbon neutrality and zero waste goals, while also demonstrating innovative ways for students to practically apply what they learn in the classroom. By working with a variety of stakeholders and demonstrating effectiveness, this program is set to grow and further strengthen our already substantial impact. As the program grows we intend to partner with community entities to further divert waste from the landfill and re-use for biofuel. Beyond the scientific knowledge we gained in the lab, this project gave us a better understanding of sustainability and the process involved in implementing sustainable practices at a university level. From designing and following our goals to presenting our findings, our experiences during this case study have helped develop our dedication to sustainability. We began this project committed to making an impact during our tenure and finished knowing that we could fundamentally change the way the university views it's disposal of waste. Additionally, this project has also expanded our knowledge of and commitment to environmental resiliency.",603,,,,,,,Energy,Waste,,,,Facilities Management,,"biodiesel,biofuels",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Liam Porter,603,Undergraduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9813/1430_Porter_1021.pdf,,,
Thompson Rivers University - The Solar Compass: A Case Study on Ground Mounted Solar Modules,"In the summer of 2017, a collective of faculty, students, industry professionals and an innovative photo voltaic manufacturer installed North America's first ground mounted solar array. The installation is on Thompson Rivers University's campus, in sunny Kamloops in the interior of BC in Canada. Dr. Michael Mehta, professor of Environmental Studies teamed up with Electrical Instructor Amie Schellenberg and Solar Earth Technologies to bring the revolutionary installation to life. There were two phases to the project, which was funded by a $25k grant from TRU's Sustainability Grant fund. The first phase was to install a small stretch of solar sidewalk, and the second is the show stopping Solar Compass located at the heart of the campus grounds. A total of 10kW are installed (between both installations) and grid-connected via micro inverter to a single phase supply at the sidewalk, and a 3 phase supply at the compass. Data is being collected and analyzed, and improvements are being made to the module manufacturing and installation process. We will be discussing the uniqueness of the modules, the installation, and the potential for this amazing technology.",1431,,,,,,,Energy,Grounds,,,,,,"solar,solar panels",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Aaron Wiebe,1431,Research Assistant,James Gordon,1431,Environmental Programs & Research Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10119/1430_Gordon_0811.pdf,,,
Getting to a Green Light: How to Build Organizational Buy-In for Large-Scale Renewable Energy,"This interactive and action-oriented session will provide insights and tools to update your understanding of renewable energy, map out critical stakeholders on campus, and translate the renewable energy opportunity into their language to get buy-in. Participants will learn how to build and communicate the business case for large-scale renewable energy. Despite renewable energy technology cost continuously declining, and a growing interest in leveraging renewables to cost-effectively meet carbon reduction goals, many campus leaders struggle to get out of the 'starting block' on procuring renewable energy at scale. Without a mandate from the top, a major challenge centers on building understanding and buy-in among cross-functional colleagues and administrative leadership. Learn from your peers on how Brown University and Michigan State University began their renewable energy journey, built organizational buy-in, navigated the process through calmer and stormier waters, and ultimately received the 'green light' from leadership. Like any large energy project on campus, large-scale renewable energy purchasing requires the involvement and 'green light' from multiple decision-makers. While typically not requiring any upfront capital outlay, it still represents a significant deviation from business-as-usual 1-3-year grid power procurement. Equipping campus leaders with tools and language to effectively communicate about large-scale renewable energy is key.",7676,439,4390,,,,,Energy,Investment & Finance,Purchasing,,,,,"renewable energy,large-scale renewable energy",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Susanne Fratzscher,7676,Director BD,Ann Erhardt,439,Chief Sustainability Officer,Leah VanWey,4390,Associate Provost for Academic Space, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Contracting for Renewable Energy Procurement: Financing and Legal Strategies and Considerations,"Colleges and universities are adopting aggressive sustainability targets and deadlines to reduce carbon emissions. To meet these targets, institutions have a range of options, including installing on-site energy generation and storage projects; investing in off-site electric power generation facilities; engaging in long-term purchases of renewable power; entering into comprehensive energy management contracts; and exploring other innovative self-generation and power purchase arrangements, including through utilities. Moreover, in many U.S. energy markets, renewable generation is becoming the most cost-effective long term option for commercial and institutional users. The financial opportunities for universities are substantial. Designing and implementing a strategy for large scale renewables procurement can save millions of dollars in the short term, and reduce exposure to energy price swings over time. Contracting for renewable energy brings a host of financial and legal issues that are new to universities. Experience from higher education renewable energy projects to date offers helpful lessons learned. And this is an area that has been extensively developed in the business context, as utilities and major corporations have focused on contracting for renewables for over two decades. This panel will discuss options and strategies for smoothing the pathway to an effective renewables strategy.",8233,,,,,,,Energy,Investment & Finance,Purchasing,,,,,"power purchase agreements (PPAs),renewable energy",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Jim Wrathall,8233,"Counsel, K&L Gates LLP", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8312/1445_Wrathall_0693.ppt,,,
Creating Campus Revenue Streams to Support Sustainability Initiatives,"Educational institutions across North America are aiming to reduce both energy spend and GHG emissions, with targets ranging from 10%-50% by 2030, 2025, or even 2020. At the same time, financial constraints appear to limit possibilities. This presentation will present creative solutions to planning, implementing and financing immediate equipment upgrades to support the long-term mission of sustainability directors. The presenters are all sustainability leads on campus, and have all found ways to work directly with their counterparts in facilities management to ensure a joint vision for the future. When Adelphi University's boilers were at end of life, the Facilities Department had an opportunity to rethink infrastructure rather than simply replace equipment. In light of high electricity rates on Long Island, they decided to self-generate with a CHP facility, reducing their GHG emissions by 3,850 metric tons (a 25% reduction) in one year and creating a significant revenue stream through savings to fund infrastructure upgrades across campus. While Ithaca College pays significantly lower rates for electricity, their ambitious carbon goals recently drove them to use wind energy for all their electricity needs. This important step has eliminated the College's Scope 2 emissions and has enabled them to get 35% closer to complete carbon neutrality. The College intends to use the RECs (renewable energy certificates) associated with the 2016 installation of the solar farm.",3169,8536,439,4390,,,,Energy,Investment & Finance,,,,,,"energy management,revenue generation,energy reduction",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Gregory Lischke,3169,Director Energy Management & Sustainability,Marc Couture,8536,"P.Eng, CEM, PMP, Solutions Developer",Ann Erhardt,439,Chief Sustainability Officer,Jessica Berry,4390,"Director, Office of Sustainability", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8625/1445_Matte_0996.pdf,,,
Agrivoltaic Arrays: Cultivating the Future of Renewable Energy,"Agrivoltaics' combines the terms, 'agriculture' and 'photovoltaics' to create a symbiotic relationship between food and renewable energy. The vast majority of solar energy generated comes from solar farms. However, as solar farms are created, potential agricultural land is lost. This project could prove that the production of clean energy and food are not mutually exclusive, in a system where the solar panels provide shade for the plants from the harsh sun, enabling more efficient growth for the plants, which in turn cool the solar panels above via evapotranspiration (in some cases by more than 20°F), making them more efficient. At the University of Arizona, only 0.5% of energy generation is from on-campus solar, despite being in one of the sunniest regions in the nation. Once completed, the installation of a rooftop agrivoltaic array will revitalize the solar energy effort on the UA campus that was paused in 2012. This project will not only improve sustainability by drastically improving land use efficiency for energy and food production, but will also serve as a site for experiential education and community outreach, as well as a place for research. Together, this project will generate approximately 50,000 kWh per year and a savings of $101,338 in utility bills over the course of 20 years. Additionally, it will provide unparalleled insights into how we can transform underutilized rooftops here in the arid Southwest, and on the UA campus (a fresh food desert).",4465,,,,,,,Energy,Public Engagement,,,,,,"agrivoltaics,renewable energy",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Stanley Wong,4465,Energy and Climate Committee Chair, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7765/1130_Wong_0173.pdf,,,
Student Funded Initiatives & the Intersections of Social Justice & Sustainability,"This is going to address clear and tangible ways students can have agency and autonomy over some of their Student Activity Fees in order to create more than just a 'Green Fund' which can help to provide students, staff, and faculty ways to fund important efforts, initiatives, and events that promote and further support a more just and sustainable future. What we will look at is how this is also an opportunity for the voices from marginalized groups who have often been unheard can participate more in this creating a more equitable, and inclusive sustainability movement at our schools. We'll also explore some of the programs and events that we at Portland Community College have done that involve food insecurity, women's health and empowerment, social/environmental justice work, and some of the classic sustainability initiatives that have improved our school, like learning gardens at all four campuses, cob structures (ovens and sheds), water filling stations, reusable dining ware, and composting systems. This will be a presentation format that will welcome plenty of audience engagement and participation. By examining and exploring the intersections of social justice and sustainability through this student funded program, we will also help to illuminate how intrinsically connected these two areas truly are. Ideally, at the end of this we can all feel even more connected moving forward and genuinely appreciate even more that we are all in this together.",2505,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,food security,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Teri Fane,2505,"Student Body President ~ Cascade Campus, Portland Community College",Joe Culhane,2505,Sustainability Communications Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10202/0830_Culhane_0905.pdf,,,

Encouraging Sustainable Food Purchasing Through Student Programs,"Many institutions endeavor to serve local and sustainable food within its dining services, but the complex and often opaque food system presents significant challenges to identifying and sourcing responsibly-produced products. To address these complexities, Skidmore College, a small liberal-arts College in upstate New York, developed a series of programs to improve the transparency of our food system, provide accountability, deepen campus consciousness, and shift food dollars to food that meet the institution's Sustainable Food metrics. This presentation will explore how a number of interconnected programs including an academic internship, a weekly low-impact dining initiative, and a student outreach team support our efforts to meet institutional sustainability goals. Collectively, the programs provide students with an opportunity to interrogate food purchases, conduct semester-long independent research, work alongside chefs to amend recipes, and deepen campus consciousness through dialogues, events, and lectures. Skidmore's diverse array of programs is the result of more than five years of development and growth. The programs offered by Skidmore's Sustainability Office and Dining Services provide a strong foundation to build upon, but there is more to achieve. Historically, the College's sustainable food percentage has remained around 10%.

BYO[Solutions]: Reuse Programs in Campus Dining,"College campuses are hubs of waste, from plastic bags to disposable food containers and single-use coffee cups. However, universities can use this opportunity to implement waste-reduction programs with the aim of instilling sustainable habits on students that will follow them into life after college. At the University of Pittsburgh we've seized this opportunity to encourage sustainable habits through the BYO[Bag] and BYO[Mug] programs. These programs educate students about packaging waste and encourage students to adopt a reuse mindset to reduce waste and save money. Before the BYO[Bag] program Pitt's Oakland campus went through 15,000 plastic bags each week. A student-supported 25¢ charge for single-use bags paired with an education campaign resulted in a 97% reduction in bag use on campus while raising money for the student Green Fund. Following BYO[Bag]'s success, we rebranded our reusable mug program to approach the problem of single-use coffee cups and are in the process of launching a campus-wide reusable container program. Our goal is to serve at least half of our beverages and to-go meals in reusable containers. We haven't figured it all out yet but we're well on our way and already have some wins behind us.",760,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Waste,,,Dining Services,,"reuse,waste reduction,reusable containers",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Nick Goodfellow,760,Sustainability Coordinator,Lyndee Feick,760,Sodexo Intern, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8013/0830_Goodfellow_0435.pdf,,,
Empowering Student Leaders to Create a Zero Waste Food Court,"In order to divert 95% of solid waste from the landfill, UCI Hospitality & Dining (HDS) and Aramark collaborate with Social Ecology Field Study interns, Campus as a Living Lab interns, a Global Foods Initiative Fellow, Green Captains, and members of organizations such as Engineers for a Sustainable World. Together, these students work with Dining's Sustainability Coordinator to plan and host quarterly events such as Wiping Out Waste, MyLastTrash activities, and Trash Talking. Students also conduct waste audits, write grant submissions, and develop project proposals. Although most of them are not environmental science or sustainability majors, 88% of the Green Captains said that they've learned more about sustainability since joining the program. While working at events, students develop leadership, public speaking, and management skills. Since joining, 94% of the Green Captains state that their leadership qualities 'have grown tremendously'. At the end of events, students fill out an evaluation to determine whether or not the event was successful and impactful. Large scale projects are also led by students. Recently, HDS installed Digital Waste Bins, an interactive system that informs guests of the carbon-equivalent emissions of their trash. For projects like the bins, Interns and fellows write project and grant proposals, and once it is funded, a student group that specializes in the subject takes the reins. For the Digital Waste Bins, HDS partnered with Engineers for a Sustainable World, a student group at UCI. The students worked on the project together, with weekly check-ins from the HDS Sustainability Coordinator. They delegated tasks between themselves, budgeted the expenses, and determined what software to use to program the devices. In just five months, HDS has developed initiatives that save over 26,000 gallons of water, divert 12% additional solids from the landfill, and tripled its number of waste education events.",3691,4502,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Waste,,,Dining Services,,"zero waste,student engagement,waste reduction",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Lotus Thai,3691,Sustainability Coordinator,Lin Tang,4502,Interim Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Closing the Loop: Building a Healthy and Sustainable Campus Food System,"California State University, Northridge (CSUN) has made remarkable changes to its food landscape in the past few years. Our campus supports and hosts multiple organic food learning gardens as well as a native plant pollinator garden that supports the important work of bees and butterflies in maintaining our food supply. The produce harvested from our gardens is donated to student volunteers, our campus Food Pantry, and local non-profits that work to feed food-insecure community members. We also offer a weekly farmers market that accepts SNAP benefits and also supports local farmers and food producers. Reducing food waste has become a major priority. To achieve this goal, a local non-profit dedicated to gleaning helps us harvest thousands of pounds of oranges from campus each year, and we have a very active chapter of the Food Recovery Network that recovers prepared foods all of our coffee shops and many restaurants on campus at the end of business days. This food is taken to community members in need. We have also implemented a food composting program that currently diverts 100% of our pre-consumer waste from the landfill, and the compost we make is used to feed the soil our food gardens, helping us close the loop in which food waste can be transformed into edible food. We're also working to reduce unnecessary single-use plastics, for example, with a 'ban the bag' initiative at all of our campus operated restaurants, have eliminating plastic straws in the Student Housing dining facility, and serve food in compostable or reusable containers with compostable cutlery. We also launched a BYOB - Bring Your Own Bottle - campaign to help educate our campus community about the free water refill stations around 'town.'

Driving Food Reconnection at Arizona State University through Collaboration between USP and Aramark,"Surveys conducted at Arizona State University dining locations indicate that the vast majority of customers care about using natural resources responsibly and make a conscious effort to only take what they can eat, yet they are not fully aware of the resources that go into food production or how their food choices impact the environment. Food reconnection at ASU begins with real nutritional food and the knowledge of its sources and impacts on the health of the planet which are fundamental to health, productivity, and connection to nature. Community gardens and gardening courses allow students to take personal ownership of a plot of land from the planting stage all the way through to harvest, with a highlight on the nutritional benefits of eating organic, seasonal produce. ASU's food service provider, Aramark partners with ASU Wellness on a weekly Meatless Monday and Carbon Footprint of food campaign in the residential restaurants to showcase the vegan Daily Root station and teach customers how to replace meat in their diets with plant-based proteins. Food Reconnection goals are present at Engrained Café, the living and learning sustainable restaurants at ASU, while urban farming through the ASU Arboretum Campus Harvest program provides students an opportunity to participate in the harvest of edible landscape from campus to be used in dining locations.

Expanding the Mission of a CanstructionU Competition to Include Partnerships for Hunger Awareness,"As part of a year-long effort to develop community partnerships themed on sustainability, Penn State Brandywine connected with the local food bank for an academic and volunteer collaboration. In the Spring 2018 semester, a kick-off event was held to generate awareness of Media Food Bank and community challenges for addressing hunger. A faculty member who addresses the scholarship of hunger and homelessness spoke to students and faculty about the importance of helping all individuals get to zero hunger, part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through one course on social media marketing, students had Media Food Bank as a client to assist them with their online marketing and promotional materials. Another course on environmental food systems formed teams to participate in the campus-wide Canstruction competition. Canstruction is a global competition that challenges teams to build structures made entirely of canned food. Although additional clubs were allowed to sign up and participate in the campus Canstruction event, the students in the environmental food systems course were required to tie in their structures with the themes of the SDGs and prepare multimedia materials to further promote awareness and education of hunger. The campus library created displays on hunger, which generated so much interest that there was new interest in our campus food pantry. All judging and voting in the competition was done electronically, while engineering students used a sustainable filament to 3-D print the awards. A campus advisory board member was brought in to speak to the students about the importance of community work in their future careers. Instead of just constructing objects from cans, we were successful as a campus crossing discipline boundaries and bringing an academic component to the competition and to assist our community partner with additional needs beyond donations.",4147,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,"competitions,hunger,food banks & pantries",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Karen Theveny,4147,"Lecturer, Communications",Laura Guertin,4147,Professor of Earth Science, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9085/1430_Theveny_0394.pdf,,,

Food Service Contracts and RFPs as Vehicle for Sourcing More Sustainable Food,"College and universities need new strategies to scale sustainable food procurement. Programs like STARS and the Real Food Challenge have institutionalized sustainable food purchasing targets and many campuses have made meaningful progress toward their goals. Still, many campuses struggle to meet their goals or have plateaued in the volume of sustainable products that they purchase. Even among campuses that have had success with sustainable sourcing the majority of food still comes from industrial-scale producers that raise crops and animals using unsustainable agricultural practices. This session will present resources and case studies of universities that have used Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and foodservice contracts as a tool to increasing sustainable food sourcing. The food served in campus dining operations is sourced either by a food service management company or by campus staff through a food distributor. In both cases, campuses are often limited to purchase food available through the established supply chains of the food service management company or distributor. While some distributors and most food service management companies offer sustainable products, choices are often limited and sustainable vendors are often not included in their 'preferred' networks. In both cases contracts and RFPs offer an opportunity for universities to articulate sustainability goals, set sourcing expectations, and create accountability.",7604,4473,3995,,,,,Food & Dining,Coordination & Planning,Purchasing,,,,,"food purchasing,requests for proposals (RFPs),food service procurement",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Andrew deCorliolis,7604,Director of Policy,Samantha Lubow,4473,Enviornment Initiatives Coordinator,Michelle Smith,3995,Green Building Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7770/0915_deCorliolis_0192.pdf,,,

Incorporating sustainability for an institution wide contract provides leverage and influences the entire campus experience. Since the transition of our new provider we have implemented recycling in dining halls, farm to table programming, and have gained our community's attention by launching the University of Houston's first farmers market. Through our new food service partnership, the University is aggressively tackling the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals of zero hunger and responsible consumption and production. With the Office of Sustainability's support, food waste programs are now stronger and built across campus and all residential dining halls established a goal of zero waste by 2020. We have also incorporated responsible consumption and production with cage free eggs, antibiotic free chicken, milk free of artificial growth hormones, and purchasing policies aligning with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program with 100% certifiable seafood from fisheries with a commitment to responsible and environmental fishing practices. Lastly, vegetarian and vegan options have been expanded and encouraged. During our presentation we plan to educate our audience on how to leverage sustainability campus wide by providing the example of our new food service partnership. The Office of Sustainability manages the sustainability contract piece and has outlined targets and methods to achieve these goals. The presentation will discuss first steps of starting at the corporate level to implementation challenges and lessons learned to guide other institutions.",2287,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Coordination & Planning,Purchasing,,,Dining Services,,"food purchasing,requests for proposals (RFPs),food service procurement",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Gabriel Durham,2287,Sustainability Coordinator,Michael Mendoza,2287,Sustainability Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9041/1430_Mendoza_0353.pdf,,,

Estimating Greenhouse Gas and Water Reduction Through Food Labeling at a University Dining Facility,"As one of the most basic requirements for survival, food plays a massive role in how humans interact, not merely with one another, but also with the environment. The diet of an average individual encompasses the majority of their environmental footprint, where some studies suggest that diet is responsible for five thousand pounds of greenhouse gasses emitted throughout their lifetime, and 92% of their daily water consumption. With the increasing global concern for climate change and its related impacts on food production, reducing the amount of environmental burden associated with feeding the growing population is imperative. Adjustments must be made to current dietary habits to prevent further, possibly irreversible, destruction to the ecological systems that act as the foundation to the global economy. At Villanova University, through the graduate Mechanical and Sustainable Engineering programs, a life cycle analysis study has been underway of the food served at one of the campus dining facilities to develop a system of labeling that denotes the environmental burden associated with the meal options provided. Surveying was completed to get a sense of the student motivation to use environmental impact as one of the decision-making criteria when choosing their meal, including the influence on the level of accuracy of the labels. This poster illustrates some of the findings from the study, including the estimated reduction in equivalent carbon dioxide emissions and water usage.",1718,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Air & Climate,Purchasing,,,,,"food labeling,life cycle assessment",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Lucy Baron,1718,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10197/1430_Baron_1076.pdf,,,
Closing the Food Loop,"As a group of student from three different universities and a diverse range of interests, we all noticed that there were many problems with the current food system. To start, we converted a 20' by 8' shipping container into a portable aquaponics farm. By harnessing the symbiotic relationship between fish and plants we are able to use 90% less water, 70% less energy, and produce 10 times the yields as compared to conventional farming. Furthermore, this farm can be deployed anywhere to provide both food and act as a communal economic asset. After being able to produce food so efficiently, we took a step back to look at the entire food system and realized that food waste is a huge problem facing the world. Inspired by the holistic loop of aquaponics, we decided to construct an anaerobic digester which could take food waste and convert it into energy. We use this energy to sustain our farm and produce extremely nutrient rich fertilizer which can help communities grow their own food. This way we could use the waste, or end of the food system to close the loop and restart the cycle through growth.",760,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Energy,Waste,,,,,"aquaponics,food waste,closed loop",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Kareem Rabbat,760,Undergraduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9451/1430_Rabbat_0796.pdf,,,
Building a Bigger Table: Engaging Communities on Food Security,"On our campus, and in the surrounding community, there appears to be a growing urge for increased engagement and 'silo-busting.' One of the largest focal points for this is food, in particular, access to healthy, affordable food that not only nourishes our individual bodies but our communities. In this session, I will share insight on some of the silo-busting initiatives The College of Charleston has been a part of in regards to food security, both off-campus and on-campus, as a recent research initiative, the Charleston YOUth Count, has indicated 30% of our students face this issue. By the time this proposal has undergone review, numbers from the YOUth Count will in for how many youth are facing food insecurity in our county as a whole. Our Office of Sustainability will have hosted a 'Sustainability Week' in which there will be at least one brainstorming session where community stakeholders will share their ideas on how to create a more just and sustainable food system. Many of these stakeholders, such as collectivists of The Stone Soup Collective, a nonprofit with strong ties to The College of Charleston, will be a part of the newly-forming Tri-County Food Alliance, a group of nonprofit leaders, professors, community advocates, farmers, and more who are working in the areas of food justice. This work we are doing within and outside our university is ongoing and highly collaborative. In this session, I will share not only our latest initiatives, but personal insight as a faculty member, nonprofit representative, and technical associate on our triumphs and struggles on addressing the food security issues we have among and outside our college community.",5047,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Public Engagement,,,,,,"food security,community engagement",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jennifer Saunders,5047,Adjunct Professor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9373/1430_Saunders_0716.pdf,,,
Raising the Bar Across North America: Tracking Sustainable Food Purchasing in Higher Education,"Across the United States, the Real Food Calculator has become a standard-setting tool for local and sustainable food procurement in higher education. This student-led research tool allows universities to assess their percentage of 'real food' on campus and to set goals around purchasing related to local economies, animal welfare, environmental impact, and fairness in the supply chain. Now, the Calculator comes to Canada! With the launch of the Good Food Calculator this year, Canadian institutions of higher education can make new strides in sustainable food procurement. Join us to learn more about the standards behind the Calculator in the US and Canada! This workshop is a great opportunity for new institutions interested in using the Calculator in their AASHE STARS assessment, as well as for seasoned researchers, to dive deeper into standards for defining just and sustainable food procurement.",6891,8560,,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,,,,"real food,food purchasing",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Dominique Fahmy,6891,Research and Projects Fellow,Nicole Norris,8560,National Good Food Lead, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Researching and Purchasing Real Food on Campus,"Our institutions of higher education have incredible purchasing power, with food budgets totaling approximately $5 billion. Instead of using their spending to support local and community-based, fair, ecologically sound, and humane food sources, the majority of their money is spent on food from industrial farms and unsustainable sources. Many campuses have made a commitment to at least 20% Real Food by 2020, and others use the Real Food Calculator as a tool to audit food purchasing on campus. In this networking session, we will discuss how to start researching your campus' food procurement, as well as how to use that research to shift campus food procurement towards more just and sustainable sources.",6891,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,,,,"real food,food purchasing",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Dominique Fahmy,6891,Research and Projects Fellow,Clarissa Chen,6891,"Undergraduate Student, Public Health", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Using FEEDS Communication Platform to Share Sustainability News From Dining Services,"As part of our commitment to sustainability, in October 2017 UNC Asheville Dining Services, a division of Chartwells Higher Ed, rolled out a new public communications platform called FEEDS: Farm-Forward Eating and Environmentally-Driven Sustainability. FEEDS helps diners better understand how our multi-level approach to sustainability benefits students, the greater community and the planet. Strategies include reducing pre-consumer waste, donating leftovers to our hungriest citizens, composting, weekly educational tables and partnerships across campus and beyond. UNC Asheville Dining Services strives to incorporate sustainability to the greatest extent possible, in a context where sustainability-minded students are forever wanting more. We believe it is important to think of food systems with a multidimensional approach. Therefore, we created a three-tiered classification system that identifies items as local, Carolina grown or from the Southeast. We use FEEDS as an umbrella to convey our sustainability message in one clear, concise platform. In this presentation, we will discuss how we arrived at this system, what we have learned and challenges we still face. Come learn about FEEDS and discover creative ways we express our sustainability platform, educate students and keep the movement progressing.

In this session we will discuss implementing these tools for Canadian and US post-secondary institutions, identify success, challenges and results as well as how the conversation is changing based on increased understanding of the food on our campuses.",2243,4603,760,3600,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,,,,"real food,food purchasing",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Megan Wibberley,2243,"Manager, Operational Sustainability and Reporting",Suzanne Savanick Hansen,4603,Sustainability Manager,Rosemary Holtz,760,Student,Nick Goodfellow,3600,Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10519/1445_Goodfellow_0704.pdf,,,
Increasing Local Food Procurement at Ontario's 24 Colleges,"Mohawk College executed an innovative project that proved that by sharing knowledge, resources, and solutions, together, colleges can work together to address systematic barriers to sustainability. The project, Increasing Local Food Procurement at Ontario's 24 Colleges was an 18-month project led by Mohawk College with support from the Greenbelt Fund and Ontario's Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs. The project began with in-depth research on the barriers and opportunities to local food procurement on campuses. Then, Mohawk and four partner colleges piloted solutions that directly responded to the research findings. Based on the pilot projects, research and further stakeholder consultation, Mohawk College released a Local Food Framework for Ontario's 24 Colleges in February, 2018. The Framework is a step-by-step guide to increasing the purchasing, preparation and promotion of sustainable, local foods on campus. It provides open-source tools, resources and templates that colleges can use to increase campus local food procurement. Increasing the amount of local food served on college campuses is an important opportunity for colleges to better serve their students and communities. By offering more local food options, colleges can increase student satisfaction, campus sustainability and their regional economic impact - all while increasing the quality of campus food services. In partnership with the Greenbelt Fund and the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food & Rural Affairs, Mohawk College led a research project that created a scalable, transferable framework to increase local food procurement at Ontario's 24 colleges. This project comprised of three phases: industry research; pilot projects; and a research summit - all of which contributed to the development of the Local Food Framework for Ontario Colleges.",6363,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,,,,"local foods,food purchasing",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Kate Flynn,6363,"Manager, Campus Sustainability and Climate Change", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Real Food Challenge at University of Pittsburgh,"The Real Food Challenge is a nation-wide initiative to bring local, fair, humane, and ecologically sound food to college campuses. By 2020, every participating institution aims to have 20% of their campus food be 'real.' This will effectively shift $1 billion nationwide of university food budgets away from industrial farms, overly-processed junk food, and other companies with labor/humane-practice violations. The network of students involved inspires leadership and passion for fixing a broken food system. At the University of Pittsburgh, Real Food Challenge interns commit to working toward these national goals. Some responsibilities include inputting data about purchases, calculating and analyzing the current percentage of real food in our main dining hall, and innovating unique solutions to increase this percentage without raising prices of meal plans. In the coming years, we will expand this initiative across campus and, after the goal is met by 2020, work toward 25% of food on campus being 'real' by 2025. Additionally, the Real Food Challenge Team at Pitt plans, promotes, and runs an annual event called Real Food Day to educate students on campus of our work and promote an improved food system. The goal of this event is to inform our peers, motivate them to take action, and gain support. As students, we have the right to access healthy, sustainable food on campus and the responsibility to leverage our institutions to invest in such a food system. Our poster aims to educate other students, organizations, activists, and institutions of the current problems in the food system and what can be done to start solving them. We are passionate about correcting an often unjust, inhumane, unhealthy food system and want to inspire others to do the same. As part of our poster presentation, we describe more about the Real Food Challenge and 'real food' in general, detail our efforts and goals, and explain how we can all contribute to bettering a food system in need.",760,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,,,,,,real food,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Zoë Neal,760,Undergraduate Student,Rosemary Holtz,760,Undergraduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Green Dining at Georgia State University,"Georgia State's insourced dining services, PantherDining, continues to impress and promote sustainability throughout campus. With the help from the Student Sustainability Fee Fund, PantherDining recently launched Freight Farms' Leafy Green Machine to begin growing produce that will be served in the dining halls- the ultimate farm-to-table experience for the Georgia State community. Furthermore, two of the University's dining halls were given the very first 3-star green certification in the south based on the categories of disposables, energy, food, furnishings and building materials, pollution and chemical reduction, and waste and water usage by the National Restaurant Association. In addition to the fantastic work of university dining staff, Georgia State students recently created a Panther Food Recovery Network where they collect surplus food from the dining halls and donate to local charities. This is the first food recovery chapter in Georgia. Just this year, the Panther Food Recovery Network has recovered and donated over 5,000 pounds of food, enough to feed 3,000 people! During this session, presenters will take a deeper dive into the benefits and challenges of all of the efforts listed above as well as resources saved.

Using Catering to Create a Virtuous Cycle of Sustainability in Your Community,"Sustainability practitioners are constantly grappling with the hard questions: How to overcome inertia of the status quo? How to get others to adopt change? How to get businesses that could face slightly increased costs to care? How to get the for-profit sector to participate in the exciting movements coming from college and university campuses? This university and catering management company found answers through aligned incentives and by driving business to vendors who have committed to helping the university achieve its sustainable food and zero landfill waste goals. This session follows the popular 2017 session by demonstrating how contracted caterers are incentivized to make sustainability commitments, how event planners know which caterers align with the university's sustainability goals, and how both parties benefit. The session focuses on results for how the program has influenced participation levels of caterers serving the university, how caterers and event planners engage on sustainability, and how this initiative enhances the intersections between sustainability and the institutional community through engaging with suppliers on food purchased and waste produced at catered events. Presenters will also demonstrate the enhanced online ordering platform that communicates the university's sustainability goals, places icons next to caterers that support these goals, and allows customers to filter for caterers designated with a sustainability icon.",8304,3931,,,,,,Food & Dining,Waste,,,,Dining Services,,catering,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Rob Lebowitz,8304,Chief Operating Officer,Kelly Weisinger,3931,Sustainability Staff, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10459/1400_Weisinger_0997.pdf,,,
How to Get Reusable Dining Containers on Your Campus!,"Many campuses serve food at dining locations in single-use plastics. These plastics may be recyclable, but unfortunately, these containers are rarely cleaned. As a result, the recycling is contaminated. In order to prevent the waste of single-use plastics, Northern Arizona University's Green Fund has implemented the O2GO program on their campus. Five dining locations in the University Union serve food for students in the container that can be reused an infinite amount of times. The Green Fund paid for the machine and containers, while campus dining runs the program. Some small universities across the campus have this program, but Northern Arizona University is the largest university in the United States. This workshop will teach students about how the Green Fund pursued the project, partnered with campus dining, and implemented the program.

The University of Notre Dame is collaborating with nonprofits and two student groups to prevent food waste from the dining halls, Au Bon Pain and catered events. One glaring issue remained: Athletics food waste. That food now goes to Cultivate Culinary, a local non-profit culinary school that gives job training to cooks who prepare meals with rescued food. Most of the trainees represent at-risk individuals in the community. Students from the University of Pittsburgh student group Food Recovery Heroes began recovering surplus food from campus dining facilities in 2014 when they realized the food that was being thrown away at the end of the day was perfectly edible and that neighbors in the community needed food donations.

Lettuce Talk: Students and Dining Staff Collaborating on Plant-Based Dining,"Plant-based diets can be healthier and more sustainable than meat-centric diets but plant-based options in college dining halls often fail to be crave-worthy. At the University of Pittsburgh dining halls, Sodexo works closely with student diners who are leading the plant-based charge to improve options on campus. The Veg Collective is a group of students (some vegan, some vegetarian, and some omnivores) and Sodexo staff who meet regularly to discuss plant-based dining options on campus including ways to improve them and to educate diners about the importance of eating a plant-based diet for your health and the environment. The partnership has produced significant changes to campus dining including the addition of two 100% plant-based (vegan) stations in the main dining halls as well as dozens of plant-based options added to locations across campus.

Put Your Fork Where Your Ethics Are: Exploring Food Systems & Leveraging University Purchasing Power,"Do you support climate change? What about modern-day slavery? You don't have to answer that, the food that you buy already does. Worldwide, food is an essential commodity that goes through an entire infrastructure of production, processing, packaging, transportation, storage, and sales. At each step, it can contribute to environmental degradation and human rights violations. Consumer demand and spending can either support or disrupt this system. How do we vote with our dollars every day when we choose what food to buy? As students, we are members of an institution that purchases food for hundreds or thousands of people each day. We have the power to make a difference in where that food comes from. We have the power to leverage the purchasing power of universities to support a better food system. In this introductory workshop, we will delve into what the food system is and how it affects the environment, farmers and farmworkers, up to the consumers. Universities play a significant role in the local, national, and global food system. We will discuss how the purchases universities make can affect our food system for better or for worse, how students can advocate a more sustainable food system on their campuses, and organizations that support students to do so. As an illustrative example, we will present a short case study for a specific product shift Johns Hopkins University has made to source their food more ethically.",515,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,,,,"food purchasing,food systems,ethics",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Bela Garces,515,Undergraduate Student,Katie Smith,515,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8607/1015_Garces_0980.pdf,,,

Supporting Sustainability Education and Biodiversity Through Grounds Management,"For the last 3 years, AASHE Sustainable Campus Index has recognized SUNY Cortland as top performing in the grounds category. This poster will highlight the variety of methods we use to support sustainability education and biodiversity through management of our campus grounds. SUNY Cortland encompasses nearly 800 acres of land with nearly 600 dedicated and devoted for outdoor educational opportunities and the preservation of natural areas and biodiversity. At our main campus, we have incorporated bioswales planted with native species, model gardens, and a growing edible forest and orchard based on permaculture principles. These efforts have resulted in not the marginalization of model gardens, or campus orchard efforts, but brought them directly to the center of campus where most students and staff cross daily. SUNY Cortland has strong engagement from the grounds department which support sustainability and biodiversity efforts through Integrated Pest Management, use of native plant species, care and support of existing campus trees and establishing no mow zones. This strong engagement has brought about summer maintenance opportunities for student employment to maintain the biodiversity in our bioswales, campus gardens and edible forest garden. In addition, there is much involvement from other staff, faculty and students through the Campus Garden /Bee Campus USA Committee which initiated and manage the campus model garden and established SUNY Cortland as a Bee Campus. The Tree Campus USA Committee works closely with the grounds staff in managing and keeping track of our campus trees, in establishing a tree replacement plan, and in diversifying the types of trees on campus, and works closely with the local community including conducting tree canopy assessments.

Pollinator Protection: Save the Monarch Butterfly!,"This poster will describe the process Central Community College uses to engage students in the support of pollinators, particularly the Monarch butterfly. Furthermore, basic information regarding Monarch butterfly behavior and research will be conveyed. CCC, as a Bee Campus USA institution and participant in Monarch Watch, actively engages students, faculty, staff, and community members in protecting pollinators. Media accounts of declining numbers of Monarch butterflies have alerted many institutional stakeholders to the importance of Monarch butterfly research and preservation. CCC's efforts to maintain pollinator gardens on our all three campuses, grow multiple varieties of milkweed, capture and purchase caterpillars, and release tagged adults has received significant attention on campus and in the community. It is hoped that sharing this information with an AASHE audience will further enhance efforts to understand and save the Monarch butterfly.",4372,,,,,,,Grounds,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,"pollinators,butterflies",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Brent Adrian,4372,Instructor of Communication, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10226/1430_Adrian_1079.pdf,,,
Rising to the Global Biodiversity Challenge: A New Model at the University of British Columbia (UBC),"With the world's 6th mass extinction underway, we are in the midst of a critical historical juncture. In a time characterized by rampant urbanization, climate change and disconnection between citizens and the environment - the need for biodiversity conservation, engagement and enhancement has never been more critical. At the University of British Columbia (UBC), a new cutting-edge model - the Campus Biodiversity Initiative: Research and Demonstration (CBIRD) serves as an innovative incubator for advancing biodiversity. CBIRD is the first campus-wide initiative of its kind in Canada, through utilizing the Campus as a Living Laboratory is an innovative hub connecting academics, practitioners and the wider community in collaborative applied research to advance biodiversity. The vision of CBIRD is to cultivate innovative ideas, research and actions to inform biodiversity policies and practice at our campus and in wider regions. Key values of CBIRD include: Interdisciplinary, whole-systems and action-orientated approach, scalability and replicability. Applying a radially organized framework, an interdisciplinary committee and framework serves as a 'hub' to guide and support a series of 'satellite' Campus as Living Lab projects which inform the development of emerging biodiversity plans and policies. Embedded within UBC's internationally recognized award winning SEEDS Sustainability Program, CBIRD represents a new innovative model in SEEDS with more than 8000 participants.",2242,,,,,,,Grounds,Curriculum,Research,,,,,"biodiversity,living labs",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Liska Richer,2242,Manager,John Madden,2242,Director Sustainability and Engineering, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8203/1045_Richer_0603.pdf,,,
Great Gardening Goals: Aligning WMU's Gibbs Permaculture Site With the UN's SDGs,"At the Western Michigan University Gibbs Site, the Office for Sustainability demonstrates permaculture techniques, and researches the validity of those techniques, while repairing damaged land, building soil carbon, increasing biodiversity, collecting water, and providing a sustainable food source for the humans and non-humans that benefit from the site. Many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are addressed at the Gibbs Site-we describe alignment with: 'Zero Hunger,' 'Quality Education,' 'Good Health and Well-being,' 'Sustainable Cities and Communities' and 'Life on Land.' Techniques demonstrated on site provide an educational alternative to the industrial agricultural model. However, the site's function is not confined to the 2 acre site-we argue that permaculture principles can help achieve each of the 17 SDGs in some capacity. We will provide several examples such as our food forest which contains over 100 varieties of different edible and non-edible plants and was designed from the perspective of the permaculture principle 'use and value diversity.' The idea of the food forest is to mimic natural systems in order to create a resilient and thriving ecosystem. A natural ecosystem contains thousands of interconnected species that all support one another-our food forest includes edible and useful plants that are beneficial to all forms of life. This dynamic network of biota is essential for providing sustained and reliable food production aligned with the SDGs.",1817,,,,,,,Grounds,Food & Dining,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),permaculture,gardens",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Molly Smucker,1817,"Student, Office of Sustainability",Helene Woyczesczyk,1817,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8348/0830_Smucker_0723.pdf,,,
Native Food Garden in the Sonoran Desert,"Since July 2017, I began volunteering at The Desert Research Learning Center (DLRC). The DRLC is owned by the National Park Service and is located adjacent to the east district of Saguaro National Park in Tucson, Arizona. The Sonoran Desert Network provides research vital for conservation to 11 different National Park Service units in Arizona and New Mexico that are relatively small and were established primarily to protect cultural resources. Besides monitoring and collecting innovatory, the DRLC aims to create a showcase of desert environment and demonstrate the kinds of sustainable practices that can help to maintain and restore life in arid lands. I am involved with their new garden project which is a variety of fall and spring crops that demonstrate sustainable gardening methods, techniques for starting a garden in Arizona, and native practices used by ancestors in Southern Arizona. The garden offers guests with a hands on learning experience in history, sustainability, and science. The DLRC also receives volunteers from the community and the University of Arizona to assist with planting, harvesting, and plant removal. The garden is watered by a drip irrigation and a rainwater collection system. Pests are controlled by the use of Neem oil. One-hundred percent organic compost was added to the soil to add nutrients and reduce pH and salinity in the desert soils. Traditional techniques in the garden included a clay watering method (Olla), the 'Three Sisters' technique, as well as growing traditional nutrient-rich foods like Tepary beans and Chiltapeans. I am so honored to be a lead in this project. I love finding ways to involve the community and I believe it is very important for everyone to learn where their food comes from. I, myself have also learned so much due to researching and designing a garden that started as a weed infested field.",4465,,,,,,,Grounds,Public Engagement,,,,,,gardens,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Megan Gaul,4465,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

Solutions for Evaluating Projects: Quadruple Bottom Line & Financial Models for Climate Neutrality,"It's time to move the conversation beyond 'financing climate neutrality.' In order to move away from traditional financial, single bottom line decision making for large capital investments, institutions must create and integrate new valuation tools which elevate climate neutrality and sustainability decision making alongside traditional financial models. Cornell University has adopted a 'quadruple bottom line' sustainability decision making framework which advances a model for People, Prosperity, Planet, and Purpose (academic mission and living laboratory potential) for use in project approval processes, capital planning, and project decision making at all levels. First used successfully in a comparison of 10 major investments for heating and powering a carbon neutral campus, the QBL framework is now being integrated into formal decision making processes across the campus from building design and construction to human resource management. This session will cover the QBL framework creation process, it's implementation for climate neutrality project financing, and the suite of tools developed by Cornell for integrated QBL into business decision making at all levels.

Adapting Portfolios to Climate Change: 2 Degrees Investing,"Green bonds are growing: Between 2015 and 2016 worldwide issuances of green bonds nearly doubled from $41 billion to $80 billion. The growth trajectory continued in 2017, as issuances for the year passed the $100 billion mark. Momentum is likely to continue as a growing number of states, counties, municipalities, and universities in the US look for solutions to finance projects in sustainable energy, transportation, clean water, forestry, and other areas. This talk will address green bonds from the climate change scenario perspective. A portfolio of green bonds not only provides high quality, global bond diversification, but also reduces a portfolio's overall carbon footprint. This reduction includes negative induction of carbon dioxide - a critical component of meeting the 2-degree investment portfolio scenario.",8633,,,,,,,Investment & Finance,Air & Climate,,,,,,"green bonds,responsible investing",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Kenneth St-Amand II,8633,Client PM, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9593/1430_StAmandII_0961_1016_094459.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9593/1430_StAmandII_0961.pdf,,
Celebrating Anniversaries: Reflecting and Adapting within Campus Green Funds,"Adaptability is key for any successful program. In spring of 2016, students renewed The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) at UC Berkeley for an additional 10 years, celebrating 10 years of a successful green fund program since its founding in 2007. A year later, in 2017, the Student Environmental Resource Center (SERC) celebrated its 5-year anniversary offering support, advising, resources and direction to campus sustainability efforts. Join UC Berkeley's TGIF Coordinator and SERC Director (also a former TGIF Coordinator) in this session of reflection, best practices, and challenges faced in each program, with a focus on TGIF. TGIF will share how it has adapted and helped support campus sustainability goals and initiatives by providing $2.5 million in funding for students, staff and faculty to realize over 180 sustainability projects, while SERC will share how it has become the departmental home for TGIF. Where one problem is solved, another is created. With plans to continue funding campus sustainability efforts through the year 2027, TGIF will share how it has begun evaluating its operations and impact through a workgroup of key stakeholders and developing a recommendations document to bolster the program moving forward. TGIF will also share some of its 'firsts' for the UC Berkeley campus, or initiatives that have grown into full-fledged, institutionally-recognized programs and services. With plans to open a physical center in the campus student union building in fall 2018, SERC will share its methods of strategic planning and how to prepare for gauging student community input to offer the most desirable and best resources for the environmental sustainability community on campus. What can be learned from celebrating anniversaries? How do anniversaries and reflection upon milestones contribute to goal-setting and strategic planning for the future?

Moving Toward Climate Justice Through Divestment and Reinvestment,"All colleges have an endowment that they use to invest in a broad range of industries. Divestment is a powerful tactic where institutions can use their political and financial power to target the financial stability and social capital of companies profiting from injustice. Since 2011, the fossil fuel divestment movement has been taking root on campuses across the world, calling attention to the climate crisis and the role of the fossil fuel industry in causing this crisis. The movement has mobilized thousands of students to take action, and to date, over 140 colleges across the world have committed to fossil fuel divestment. It remains the fastest growing student movement in history. We will discuss the underlying moral and political arguments behind divestment, the basic financial considerations, the movement's current direction in centering climate justice and reinvestment, and go over a 'how-to' for a campaign. Participants will receive resource materials to help them start campaigns of their own and will be plugged into the national campus fossil fuel divestment network.

Aligning Endowment Investments With the Sustainable Development Goals,"The past few years have seen a surge in interest and activity around how endowment investment practices can be better aligned with institutional mission, values, and sustainability goals. Endowment decision-makers are increasingly looking for opportunities to align investments with sustainability goals and shift capital to sustainability solutions. One strategy is for university endowments to align their portfolios with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) -- a growing trend among investment managers worldwide. The SDGs provide a compelling framework to contextualize the sustainability leadership of American colleges and universities. This session will include a moderated discussion among leaders in the higher ed sustainability movement, senior administrators, and investment professionals about how the SDGs can serve as a framework for endowment investing.

Climate Memes: Undergraduates Making Climate Data Go Viral,"On Earth Day 2017, Climatepedia boothed in Pershing Square at the March for Science-Los Angeles. Students from the University of California, Irvine branch of the organization displayed their signs at the booth, along with information on climate change. The most popular signs were those with memes, which were viewed by thousands of people at the march. Memes are a form of imagery that have become increasingly prevalent in today's culture because they are relatable and easily shareable. Undergraduate students from Climatepedia realized that memes were an ideal medium to spread the word about the scientific consensus on climate change, as well as communicate the risks and consequences of issue to the millennial generation. Thus, Climatepedia students launched a meme page on Instagram. According to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, less than 50% percent of adults in America discuss climate change at least occasionally. Memes are a simple, culturally relevant, and humorous way to bring light to climate change. Memes provide context quick in ways that regular images cannot, making their messages more effective. Through this project, students involved with Climatepedia are working on their own climate literacy. As part of their own climate literacy training, they find charts, graphs, and data online that they believe should be shared. The meme page serves as a stepping stone to expose people to climate-related information.",4502,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Air & Climate,Campus Engagement,,,,,"climate change,memes,communications",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Gianna Lum,4502,"Undergraduate Student, Earth System Science",Patricia Haigh,4502,Undergraduate, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7839/0830_Lum_0245.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7839/0830_Lum_0245.pdf,,

Learning from our Future: Engaging Youth in Climate Justice,"How do we build a truly inclusive climate justice movement that values every voice and experience? Engage young people. They have a lot to say, and are eager to say it. In 2016, the University at Buffalo co-hosted an event that brought seventy youth between the ages of 12-21 from all over Western New York together at an interactive forum specifically focused on climate justice. These young people had a dialogue on climate change and how it has impacted their lives. They had a frank and honest conversation that answered critical questions on the current conditions of Western New York pertaining to social justice, the Black Lives Matter movement, and climate change. After an afternoon of communication and relationship building, the youth participants and adult facilitators were energized about future possibilities working in the climate justice movement together. They formed a committee and are currently building on the momentum that was created two years ago. This interactive session will discuss the tactics and tips that higher education can use to meaningfully engage diverse youth that live in communities that will be unequally impacted by climate change.

"How Higher Ed Helps Enact Tomorrow's Climate Change Legislation, Today!","New York City is poised to enact the world's most sweeping climate change legislation, based on the innovation, validation, and support of higher education. How did NYU lead in making this landmark legislation possible? And how can your institution do the same? Examples will include: 1) Long-term planning: Universities invest in energy savings as proving grounds for carbon commitments and reduction. Who should this information be shared with to influence local climate policy? 2) Research: Cities don't perform original research, so university departments from Engineering to Planning can lay the groundwork for impactful, evidence-based policy. How can government and research be connected? 3) Scale: Campuses are cities in miniature, and thus guide policies that affect the real estate industry. How can universities exert influence in this realm? With NYU at the forefront, higher ed has led the way in pushing NYC towards landmark climate policy. In this session, we're going to share our experiences, things we learned, and have an open discussion about how the work might translate elsewhere. Participate in the discussion of how your institution's focus on climate change and social justice can not only help local governments improve policy, but give students, frustrated with a lack of federal policy progress, a chance to get involved.",2138,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Buildings,Research,,,,,"climate policy,advocacy",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Cecil Scheib,2138,Assistant Vice President for Sustainability, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10015/0830_Scheib_0242.pdf,,,
"Co-Designing a Sustainable, Native American Cultural Center with the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate","Public engagement is a crucial way for higher education institutions to align their teaching and research activities around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This case study examines how an interdisciplinary University of Virginia research team of faculty and students is collaborating with the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate (SWO) to design a sustainable Cultural Center on the tribe's Lake Traverse Reservation in South Dakota. Working with SWO tribal members, the Nis'to native non-profit organization, and the Sisseton Wahpeton Tribal College, this publicly engaged sustainability research combines scholarly and creative methods to propose programs, architecture, and landscapes to support traditional and contemporary Dakotah culture, including visual arts, dance, music, theater, culinary arts and agriculture. Together we are exploring how Native culture and tribal sovereignty goals can guide natural resource management, cultural production, and the design of space, form, material, and meaning in the constructed environment.

Community Impacts Through Energy-Efficient Housing Education,"The Energy Efficient Housing Research Group (EEHR), an outreach arm of the Hamer Center for Community Design, is a conduit between high-performance housing research and housing stakeholders. EEHR connects multidisciplinary students and faculty from across Penn State with community partners in Pennsylvania through engaged-scholarship projects to advance the research, design, and implementation of energy efficient homes. EEHR has three iterative and interrelated aims: Design Innovation, Evaluation, and Education and Engagement of 'responsible housing'-housing that is affordable, sustainable, and healthful. In addition to housing research, EEHR has facilitated the University's Race to Zero team in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center. For this Department of Energy sponsored collegiate competition, students from across the university work collaboratively to design and document a zero-energy ready home. In each of the five years of the competition, Penn State has partnered with a local affordable housing organization to inform the site and context for the project. The result of this partnership elevates the educational experience by providing a 'real-world' project while also allowing students to inform the housing organizations about appropriate high-performance design practices and building science. With the added goal of designing with a local client, students are also able to have a lasting impact in the Penn State area, such as with the construction of the GreenBuild duplex in the State College Borough, a set of two attached high-performance homes modeled after the 2015 Penn State Race to Zero project submission. This presentation will examine the work and research done by EEHR through engaged-scholarship projects and competitions like the Race to Zero and how EEHR is able to create real change through student and housing stakeholder education throughout Pennsylvania.",4190,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,Energy,,,,,"housing,energy efficiency",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Christopher Hazel,4190,Energy Efficient Housing Researcher, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Mapping our Participation in the United Nations Global Compact: Storytelling and Sustainability,"As a participant of the U.N. Global Compact, the State University College of New York at Geneseo uses the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals as a framework to talk about our local and global sustainability efforts. As members of the President's Sustainability Commission for Geneseo, we came up with an innovative way to organize our efforts and communicate them with the public. We are using ArcGIS to tell the comprehensive story of how the college and its faculty, alumni and students are leading sustainability efforts - on campus, regionally and throughout the world. Our interactive storytelling map addresses each of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals and the difference our efforts are making. (www.geneseo.edu/sustainability) This unique tool has allowed us to effectively catalogue our efforts as well as educate our stakeholders, students, faculty and staff on the breadth of what working towards a sustainable world really looks like. This session will focus on how we developed the map, how we organized content according to each Sustainable Development Goal, ongoing maintenance, and how visibility of our efforts has helped expose areas that need work. We will also share how we use the map in our communications strategy to strengthen Geneseo as a leader in sustainability.

Weatherizing Together: Finding Effective Community Partnerships,"Is your school planning on or already implementing a home weatherization program? Have you found community partners for your program? Furman University's home weatherization program, the Community Conservation Corps (CCC), aims not only to help individual homeowners, but also to build an important relationship between the university and the community. The program began 9 years ago as a way to reduce homeowners' energy costs while claiming carbon credits from the energy saved. However, strong community partnerships have enabled the CCC to be much more effective. The Community Conservation Corps has uncovered multiple community partnerships from energy companies and contractors to non-profits and other universities that have made the program successful. This presentation will examine the various community partnerships the CCC has had, the benefits and barriers of forming collaborations, as well as future projects for collaboration. The audience will participate in discussion to gain a sense of what others are doing and how to address issues at their home institutions.",3836,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,Energy,,,,,"community partnerships,weatherization",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Hannah Dailey,3836,Program Coordinator,Kelly Grant Purvis,3836,Associate Director of Sustainability Programs, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9207/1430_Dailey_0536.pptx,,,

Social Marketing/Behavior Change Practitioner Meetup,"Are you interested in using marketing as a behavior change agent? Me too! Let's get together for a focused discussion about goals, challenges, and successes in your behavior change programs. Please bring any materials to share as we learn from each other. For those new to social marketing, it is not social media. Social marketing integrates commercial marketing concepts with other approaches to influence positive behavior change for individuals and communities-- all for a greater social good. It's getting you to brush your teeth, rather than getting you to buy the toothbrush. For a more technical explanation, industry leaders defined social marketing through a consensus definition building process in the following way: 'Social Marketing seeks to develop and integrate marketing concepts with other approaches to influence behaviors that benefit individuals and communities for the greater social good. Social Marketing practice is guided by ethical principles. It seeks to integrate research, best practice, theory, audience and partnership insight, to inform the delivery of competition sensitive and segmented social change programs that are effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable'.",2188,6513,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"behavior change,marketing",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Andrew Lentini,2188,Sustainability Coordinator,Alec Cooley,6513,Senior Advisor, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Universities as Catalysts for Transformative Sustainable Change,"This session will explore how universities can serve as anchor institutions in their communities, advancing their own goals and regional sustainability at the same time, through education about and implementation of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Session participants will describe specific initiatives aimed at catalyzing transformative sustainable change in the campus community and in their regions. All of the participants - from Agnes Scott College, Georgia Institute of Technology, Emory University, University of Georgia, Spelman College, and Southface in the Atlanta area; Coastal Carolina University in Georgetown County, South Carolina; and Portland Community College in Portland, Oregon - are founding members of University Regional Centres of Expertise (RCE) on Education for Sustainable Development acknowledged by UNC, which aim to advance SDG #4 - 'ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all' - through university-community partnerships. The session will include a lightning round of presentations on a range of university initiatives - Emory's Water Hub that helps alleviate sanitary sewer overflows in underserved communities (SDG 6); Georgia Tech's Living Building - the first in the Southeast (SDG 9); Spelman's work with the EcoDistrict covering nearby Atlanta neighborhoods (SDG 11); Agnes Scott's educational programs linking climate action to gender equality (SDGs 5,13).",494,1109,3931,2188,2505,3192,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),community partnerships",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Susan Kidd,494,"Executive Director, Center for Sustainability",Jennifer Hirsch,1109,"Director, Center for Serve-Learn-Sustain",Ciannat Howett,3931,Director of Sustainability,Kevin Kirsche,2188,Director of Sustainability,Kim Smith,2505,Sociology Instructor,Iesha Baldwin,3192,Sustainable Spelman Student Intern, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8294/1130_Smith_0674.pdf,,,
Connecting Communities to Data That Matter - Linkages Through SDGs,"In recent years, a rising number of innovative firms and entrepreneurs have intentionally coalesced around university centers to bring invention plus implementation together. These universities known as anchor institutions typically are concentrated in downtown communities that grapple with sustainability challenges such as poverty, pollution, food deserts, etc., many of which are subsumed in the SDGs. While metro-Atlanta has one of the highest concentrations of institutions of higher education (IHE) in the United States, these anchor institutions have historically operated in silos and not been part of a network to address these challenges. United Nation sanctioned Regional Centres of Expertise (RCE) on Education for Sustainable Development bring this much needed collaborative support to these ecosystems. RCE Greater Atlanta, one of only 6 RCEs in the United States, is an innovative network of universities, government, and non-profits that emerged from a realization by many of these universities that a sharing of expertise beyond our campus walls and regional collaborations are needed for sustainable development. IHEs can serve a key role in bridging the gap between communities and lack of access to 'empowering data' that meet critical needs while at the same time empowering residents to become change agents in their communities, such as recent use of GIS mapping data to identify food desert challenges and opportunities. Our challenge then is connecting universities to the public, particularly vulnerable communities, to data that will inform their decision making processes and empower them to become change agents working towards implementing the SDGs in their communities. In addition to exploring this challenge, community partner, Kwabena Nkromo, Founder and Lead Principal of Atlanta Food & Farm PBC will discuss IHE's pivotal role in connecting vulnerable communities to data.",1109,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),data,research centers",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Carol Thurman,1109,Academic Assessment Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9051/1430_Thurman_0362.pdf,,,
Role of Higher Education Institutions in Reducing Poverty by Promoting Sustainable Tourism,"All college and university campuses are imbedded in a local community. All communities have the potential to offer ecotourism opportunities to residents and visitors. Ecotourism/sustainable toursim is now defined as 'responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of the local people, and involves interpretation and education' (TIES, 2015). The questions then become: How can the students, faculty and employees of higher education promote and support ecotourism/ sustainable tourism in their communities to leverage economic development? What methodologies and experiences exist on this topic? This session will share what has been done in the community colleges of Santa Fe, NM and Dallas, TX. The presentation will describe of the work with stakeholders to promote and train the community about the importance of sustainable development and how ecotourism can help conserve the environment and produce jobs and quality of life for the local community.

This 30-minute session provide students an opportunity to share their ideas and initiatives using social media to connect campus with other parts of the community. @IUSBees uses Twitter to connect Campus and Community participants in learning about the world of bees and their importance to sustainability. Participants learn how Bees are helping to meet the Sustainable Development Goals #2 Zero Hunger, and #17 Partnerships for the Goals. One of the challenges in meeting Sustainable Development Goal #2 Zero Hunger is food production, as primary pollinators Bees are vital to global food production. One of the challenges in meeting Sustainable Development Goal #17 Partnerships for the Goals is bringing communities together. Housing Honey Bees on the IUSB campus will create a partnership between the local community and the IUSB campus community. Our participants will take a journey into the world of Bees where they will learn how Bees are helping to meet Sustainable Development Goals #2 Zero Hunger, and #17 Partnerships for the Goals, Participants will learn why Bees are important as primary pollinators to food production, how Bees stay warm in the winter, and how Bees add to campus culture through partnerships between the Beekeeper, Bees, Students, and local Community.",6354,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"bees,social media,pollinators",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Daniel Clay,6354,Project Developer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Using the UN SDGs to frame community resilience assessment and planning for students and partners,"After Allegheny signed Second Nature's Resilience Commitment (Climate Commitment signed in 2007), the sustainability coordinator cultivated collaborative partnerships in the community and explored ways to support existing work while developing a unique resilience assessment and planning process that cultivates a community-based understanding of our vision for the future. An existing process, My Meadville, funded by the Orton Foundation, allowed Allegheny to partner with individuals working out of the Meadville Redevelopment Authority to interview over 700 citizens, gather stories, and transform them (through transcription and coding) to establish eight community themes and value statements that resonate with citizens. In parallel to this work, the sustainability coordinator and a professor of Environmental Science and Sustainability integrated the community resilience assessment work into the curriculum of a junior seminar. A team of nine students approached resilience through the lens of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to understand local resilience within the global context while challenging first-world assumptions about where and who issues of poverty, hunger, inequality, etc. are experienced. Students gathered data from a community health needs assessment, a municipal Sustainable Community certification, System of Care data, as well as many other sources to develop an assessment of Meadville's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as we develop a vision for a resilient future. We'll discuss lessons learned as we developed the resilience assessment, a community network map, and a method for sharing resources and research with community partners.

Repairing our Foodshed,"Wells College has acted to address gaps within its local foodshed. Responding to area 'food desert' conditions, the college initiated the Aurora Farmers Market to provide community residents access to fresh, locally-grown, seasonal produce during summer months and offering small area gardeners and growers with a retail opportunity for their bounty. The 4-year-old Aurora Farmers Market is run by a paid student market manager, supported by Wells student interns. The College is also in its fourth year of offering a free community Seed Exchange program, operated out of the institution's Library - hundreds of area gardeners and small produce growers have utilized the exchange to obtain free seed, much of it organic and GMO-free. The College's Introduction to Gardening class offers students in the college's Sustainable Food Systems program with hands-on learning opportunities.

What Does a Tree Have to Do with Interior Design?,"On the McConnell Springs site of Lexington, Kentucky, there exists an historically significant tree - one of only a few old Bur Oaks that remain since the early days of settlement. Its large, impressive form encourages visitors as they walk by and encourages visitors to explore. However, a massive branch is growing out and over the pedestrian trail. Over time, the tree will be unable to support the growing branches because the core of the tree is hollow, making a more typical cable system would not provide an effective solution. One design faculty assigned first year students the task of designing a tree crutch for the Bur Oak, taking into consideration how surrounding elements interact with the tree crutch and the overall space as well how users interacted with it. By allowing students to become intimately familiar with the design process, many practical, yet design conscious structures were created that would not only complement the Bur Oak but also act as support for the overhanging limb. If the limb were to fall, it would be upheld by the tree crutch, thus keeping visitors and the surrounding trees safe. As the project continued to develop, the faculty member and a select group of students connected with community members, stakeholders and specialists, through a collaborative process - a Community Design Event. The process began by creating informational material to hang in the Community Room at McConnell Springs to gather ideas, which was followed by an open-invitation charrette. The results from the charrette, including the designs created by the students will be implemented into building the tree crutch, with construction scheduled to begin Spring 2018. A project focusing on bringing the study of interiors to the outdoors transcends the traditional ideas and boundaries, prioritizes sustainability, and challenges students to think of the outdoors as a space that can be preserved and renewed through theories of human interaction and experience of space.",1600,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Curriculum,,Design,,,,trees,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Emily Andreasson,1600,Student,Alexa King,1600,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

A University-Community Research Collaboration to Promote Sustainable Agriculture for Food Security,"Many counties of Western North Carolina have high levels of food insecurity that may be addressed by training communities to grow, prepare, and preserve their own food. Through the McCullough Fellows program, the University of North Carolina Asheville develops partnerships between faculty and students with area organizations to address locally identified needs. In collaboration with a Section 8 housing development in Polk County, NC and the local organization Groundswell International, a faculty-student team from UNCA developed and tested a sustainable agriculture curriculum in the summer of 2016. Research for the program development investigated successful community agriculture projects and assessed participant learning. Weekly classes were conducted and evaluated, and an overall assessment of the program included pre- and post-surveys. Challenges included frustration over constraints enforced by the housing rules, poor soil, and unbearable Polk County heat. This program specifically addresses the second Sustainable Development Goal: to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. The final 'Grow Food Where People Live' 13-lesson curriculum is open access and, with some modifications based on region, can be applied to any community struggling with food security challenges.",4237,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Food & Dining,Curriculum,,,,,"food security,sustainable agriculture",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Alison Ormsby,4237,"Faculty, Environmental Studies", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
"SDG2: Global Challenge, Local Solutions Powered by Penn State University Food Security Initiatives","With the mission of creating hunger-free and healthy communities through engaged scholarship, several Penn State campuses have joined forces to begin the efforts in their regions. They have partnered with non-profit organizations to offer meaningful service learning opportunities but also to enhance the operations of the partners in the area of Zero Hunger. The student-driven projects include creating food pantries on the campuses, gleaning food for regional food pantries, Waste Not programs, community tables with homeless populations, community-based activities and United Nations exercises. A much bigger project that several campuses have started and are growing is student farms. In these farms, best practices are shared with our communities. The gardens are tasked with running sustainably through Community Supported Agriculture, selling back to campus or other venues. A portion of the community gardens goes directly to support the underserved in our communities. The goal of these projects is twofold; to increase meaningful engaged scholarship opportunities for our students while increasing community engagement which will build capacity and increase town/gown relations. The connecting element of all of these projects is the educational opportunities for our college-level students to create a change in culture for future generations.

"Intersections of Food Waste, Hunger, and Spectrums of Homelessness, Abuse, and Addiction","Homeless adults have disproportionate rates of chronic diet-related diseases, food security, rates of obesity, as well as co-morbidities such as diabetes. The outlook is even worse for children and youth. Yet, most have access to a preponderance of energy-dense, nutrient-deficient foods at shelters and pantries. University of Utah's Center for Community Nutrition has implemented a longitudinal study assessing the efficacy of nutrition education, healthy food access, and food environment improvements for individuals, families, and youth across spectrums of homelessness, abuse, and addiction. One commonality is that our clients face chronic stress. Continual activation of stress hormones alters physiological processes, and is shown to be a correlate to obesity, heart disease, addiction, depression, and more. To compound these effects, a key stress hormone, cortisol, is increased during caloric restriction, which then cyclically increases stress levels. We are working with shelters to improve existing, or start new, on-site vegetable gardens. Through our campus Food Recovery Network, we work with our Dining Services, restaurants, and grocers to decrease healthy foods from entering landfills through diverting food waste to our shelter sites. And, we photographically document shelter pantries and food storage to measure shelters' food environment changes. Our aim is to increase access to healthy foods, decrease hunger, decrease food waste, and improve the food environment.",3994,6643,,,,,,Public Engagement,Food & Dining,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,"food waste,hunger,wellness,food recovery,food banks & pantries",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Shannon Jones,3994,Associate Instructor/Project Lead,Jennifer Nielsen,6643,Chartwells, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Solar and Sheep Grazing - Is it for Ewe?,"Does your institution have solar panels or are you thinking about installing them? Does your institution have sheep or know someone who does? If you answered 'yes' to either of these questions, then you (ewe) may be ready for a Solar-Sheep partnership. Solar panels, while certainly great at producing renewable energy, come at a cost. Installation costs aside, there are additional, longer-term costs like ground and fence maintenance and the more abstract opportunity cost of land that is now 'tied up' for a single purpose. What if we could find a way to reduce some of those costs? Enter: sheep. Why sheep? Sheep, unlike goats, are grazers, eating short plants close to the ground. They can easily graze the hard-to-reach areas underneath the panels, fertilizing as they go, reducing the need for time-consuming, costly, greenhouse gas-producing mowing. The solar panels provide shade and shelter for the sheep, and if adequate fencing is in place and water is available, often no other infrastructure is necessary. This sustainable partnership can make financial sense, practical sense, and be a great way to forge a unique community partnership while providing ample opportunities for learning and engagement. In this session, we will discuss the solar-sheep partnership at Furman University, including how it originated, key stakeholders, the hurdles we encountered along the way, the current status, and our plans for the future.",3836,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Grounds,Energy,,,,,"solar,solar panels,livestock",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Laura Bain,3836,Associate Director of Sustainability Assessment,Hannah Dailey,3836,Program Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9170/1430_Bain_0501.pdf,,,
EAN Sustainability Index: How to Measure the Sustainability in an University Incubator?,"The implementation of sustainability at the EAN University is a process that takes more than eight years, however, being an institution whose focus is entrepreneurship, it is clearly necessary to incorporate sustainability into the process of training future entrepreneurs, but also, It requires tools to measure 'how sustainable is an enterprise'. More than 300 ideas pass annually through the EAN Impacta program (EAN university incubator program) and more than 30 new companies leave the University every year with their business models. Therefore, it was necessary to develop a tool to help measure the level of implementation of the sustainability of these new ventures, beyond the theoretical-practical content offered at different elective and nuclear courses at the academic levels. With this in mind, criteria and variables of previous research were proposed and analyzed to determine qualitative and quantitative variables that would allow the development of a quantitative index.

Measuring Student Attitudes Towards Sustainable Development With a One-Semester Sustainovation,"In Fall 2017, Penn State Brandywine kicked off an initiative titled Sustainovation, emphasizing programming and community collaborations through sustainability and innovation. The campus identified three community partners to work with to assist in advancing the partner education and outreach goals. Several courses and student clubs from across the campus came together at the beginning of the semester for an initial meeting to be introduced to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to meet the community partners and to hear about the semester projects. In addition, a survey was given to the students to define their attitudes towards sustainable development before working with these partners and the projects. The validated survey from Biasutti & Frate (2017) addressed the four constructs of environment, economy, society, and education. Throughout the semester, students from across the disciplines and faculty/staff from Academic Affairs, IT, and the Library worked with adding an educational component to a local arboretum's fall festival, bringing mobile technology to an updated tree biodiversity tour at a state park, and writing essays addressing the SDGs as a curricular resource for a statewide teacher organization. At the end of the semester, the same survey was given to student participants in sustainovation projects. Aggregate data show that there is a statistically significant difference in student attitudes at the 95% confidence level (t-test).",4147,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Research,Waste,,,,,"student attitudes,community partnerships",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Laura Guertin,4147,Professor of Earth Science,Karen Theveny,4147,"Lecturer, Communications", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Lifting up the UN SDG's in Pennsylvania: The Power of the Penn State Sustainable Communities Network,"The Sustainable Communities Collaborative Network at Penn State is an example of the power of working across campus boundaries to address sustainable development projects state-wide. Six campuses have worked collaboratively with each other and with community partners on a variety of projects that address many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals including SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). Monthly meetings allow the campuses to identify barriers and obstacles, brainstorm collectively, and share solutions. The network of faculty and staff among the campuses shares tools such as a Memorandum of Understanding, a Project Agreement Form, a learning assessment instrument, and funding opportunities to strengthen our work as a University and to improve the quality of the work that we do with our community partners. The network approach also allows sharing of faculty expertise across campuses so that faculty and students from one campus can work with a partner in the community of a different campus. The presenters will share lessons learned and tips for success in establishing a network and using the UN SDG's as a framework for working in communities.",4190,4147,,,,,,Public Engagement,,,,,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),community partnerships,inter-campus collaboration",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Ilona Ballreich,4190,Program Manager,Peter Boger,4190,"Assistant Director for Outreach and Engagement, Sustainability Office",Angela Fishman,4190,Associate Teaching Professor,Laura Guertin,4147,Professor of Earth Science,Karen Theveny,4147,"Lecturer, Communications", ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10150/1430_Ballreich_0541.pdf,,,
"10,000 Makes Mini Sustainable Product Make-A-Thon","This workshop is the Design U 10 Thousand Makes Make-A-Thon but in a smaller workshop format. The 10,000 Makes Make-A-Thon is give them a pile of reused materials and a glue gun, or something similar and tell them to ideate different ways that they can take something and reuse it for something else or create something new. Design U every year puts on the 10,000 makes 24 hour make-a-thon where we bring in engineers, designers and business students to create something new. We start by giving them a how might we statement which goes along with our yearly theme. This year we chose Sustainability and Upcycling. Up until this year sustainability has not been our main focus, we haven't even thought about it. As a team we sat down and had to think about our team, we mainly wanted to think about impact and making sure that this Make-A-Thon would change how people perceive design, engineering and business. We decided to eliminate the plethora of resources and the budget to buy materials that the participants had in years past and use Thinking Sustainably is basically the same thing as design thinking because you need to brainstorm other uses to even how to get your materials to a place where they can be reused. Students and facility will get in groups of 5-9 and begin by brainstorming what they could do with the objects on their table. The objects on the table are basically found objects that will be provided from a reuse center. Next, ideas will be written down on white boards and write down as many ideas as they can for different ways to combine, subtract, add and make something new from what they have. The idea is to get quantity over quality which means the more ideas that you generate the better the ideas will get. The teams sketch every idea and briefly explain the idea to the group The idea is to use what you have to make something new that serves a purpose. The group votes on an idea and then with a few adhesives will build their final product.",32,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Waste,,,,,,"reuse,do-it-yourself,upcycling",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jessica Foor,32,Graphic Designer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Localizing UN Sustainable Development Goals in Hawaii: The Community as our Living Laboratory,"The 2018 State of Hawaii legislative session saw the introduction of bills to codify the UN SDG framework at the local level. Hawaii has a long history of sustainability, and its integrated approach to environmental, social, and economic priorities corresponds closely to the SDGs. A set of statewide 2030 sustainability goals, developed through Hawaii's Aloha+ Challenge, is a recognized place-based model to implement the SDGs and can serve as an example for other state and local governments of a cutting-edge initiative to localize the global goals. Just as the global SDGs can provide a balanced blueprint for local policy, bottom-up initiatives, such as the Aloha + Challenge, can demonstrate local community solutions to global challenges. This presentation: 1) tracks the journey of the SDG-related bills through Hawaii's 2018 legislative session; 2) considers how other subnational governments can learn from the Hawaii case to localize SDGs; and 3) examines the role of higher education, community engagement, and partnerships in promoting SDGs.

Taking It to the Next Level: Campus-Community Partnerships,"Engagement between campus and the local community is a strong priority for many institutions, often focused in service learning and volunteerism. But siloed approaches to service learning and volunteerism do not always address the complete needs of the community. Comprehensive course-community programs take engagement to a higher level, addressing real world challenges with the expertise of faculty, the ingenuity of students, and the perspectives from community partners. This model brings courses from across the university to focus on real-world challenges that are identified by a community partner, simultaneously providing experience to students and solutions to sustainability issues. These programs have the ability to address the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on a local and state level. In this panel representatives from multiple universities that have incorporated similar frameworks will reflect on their experience in addressing SDGs through collaborative partnerships. Penn State will share an example of a single project that brought five courses from five different colleges together to collaborate on a single project that touches on multiple SDG's including Good Health & Wellbeing (SDG 3), Clean Water & Sanitation (SDG 6) and Life on Land (SDG 15). University of Florida will share an example of multiple projects focused on a single SDG, Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11).",2088,4190,,,,,,Public Engagement,,,,,,,"community partnerships,service learning",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Maya Patel,2088,Strategic Projects Manager,Ilona Ballreich,4190,Program Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10153/1445_Ballreich_0814.pptx,,,
Raising the Bar - Updated Environmental & Social Criteria for EPEAT-Registered Computers/Displays,"Product design has progressed, and EPEAT standards are progressing along with them. An update to the computer and display standard that large-scale purchasers have relied on to identify more sustainable IT products over the past 11 years is near completion. New criteria include include supplier energy efficiency; full material disclosure; labor and human rights; occupational health and safety, F-GHG emissions; reporting on suppliers; CSR practices, raw materials extraction; and conflict mineral reporting. Products that meet the new standard, with elevated sustainability and social criteria, will begin to appear on the EPEAT Registry in November of this year. This session will guide those who currently require use of EPEAT for purchase of computer and display products on how to best address the transition to the new standard, including revisiting current EPEAT specified language in contracts, and a review of the status of EPEAT products currently being purchased. Those who are not yet evaluating their IT products for sustainability will leave the session with easy-to-use tools for aligning electronic procurement with their overall sustainability goals.

Data-Driven Planning for Campus Materials Management - From Inputs Through Outputs,"While the higher education sustainability field is grappling with materials management challenges, from procurement through waste operations, there are limited tools and processes for data-driven planning. University campuses yield the purchasing power and environmental impact of small cities. We import nearly all materials needed to sustain residential populations and fuel research activities, driving demand for thousands of products from global supply chains. Our campuses also export nearly all waste generated, relying on processing systems driven by available infrastructure and global markets. Fulfillment of our educational and research missions and achievement of positive contributions requires material consumption; however, there are also impacts of material consumption that lack alignment with higher education's values, posing reputational risks to our institutions. In order to grow a more sustainable approach at MIT, we've formed a faculty/researcher/student/operations partnership to understand material flows--grounded in urban metabolism-- impacts and opportunities. By establishing a baseline campus materials flow analysis, MIT aims to use data-driven planning to leverage MIT's purchasing power-of both procurement activities and waste management-in order to drive impacts that reflect MIT values while mitigating risks.",2697,,,,,,,Purchasing,Coordination & Planning,Waste,,,Purchasing/Procurement,,materials management,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Brian Goldberg,2697,Sustainability Staff,Rachel Perlman,2697,Graduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8273/0915_Goldberg_0659.pptx,,,

Internal Carbon Tax: Methods and Results from the First Rigorous Willingness-to-Pay Study,"Internal carbon fees raise awareness, incentivize behavior changes, and create revenue streams to reduce emissions. While there are a substantial number of internal carbon pricing programs in the private sector, these programs are still very rare in universities. There appears to be no published academic research, as yet, that explores the systematic determinants of individuals' willingness to incur the costs of internal carbon pricing programs of different types. Using realistic policy choice scenarios and best practices from so-called 'stated preference' research the University of Oregon research team assessed the strength of demand for several types of internal carbon pricing programs. We established price points constituents are willing-to-pay in exchange for emissions reductions. Since the costs and benefits are unlikely to be uniformly distributed (there will be 'winners' and 'losers') the project also investigates how they are valued by different campus stakeholders. This research is guided by Dr. Trudy Cameron, a noted environmental economist and expert in the design of stated preference surveys.",3746,,,,,,,Research,Air & Climate,Investment & Finance,,,,,carbon pricing,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Steve Mital,3746,Director of Sustainability,Ryan Walch,3746,Ph.D. Candidate, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

We will explore the research agenda articulated in this report. Invited speakers will describe significant research needs to better understand urban systems within a systems dynamics framework. You will learn about current and future trends in global urbanization and opportunities to engage in collaborative research toward redesigning urban systems for improved sustainability. Topics to be discussed include: tension between the urban-rural dichotomy, urban poverty, urban transportation systems, urban food systems, urban natural resource allocations, and urban redevelopment toward more sustainable designs. You will also engage in break-out discussions with experts to develop deep understanding of the levers of change leading to new concepts of urban systems and specific research needs aimed at creating more sustainable urban systems.

Campus Action Research Advances Sustainable Development Goals,"Across North American college campuses, learners seek to enhance our sustainability competency through acting locally to advance the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainability Action Research (SAR) provides a systematic approach for both students and practitioners to do so. Here we define SAR as an iterative process of assessment, planning, action and reflection to test and advance a theory of change toward realizing sustainable development. We demonstrate how faculty, students and staff can serve as SAR catalysts and leaders. For example, George Mason University faculty use SDGs as an organizing framework for undergraduate sustainability majors' capstone SAR projects and as foci for developing an interdisciplinary graduate certificate in Action Research for Social and Ecological Impact. UCLA hosts student-initiated, student-designed, and student-facilitated SAR projects on campus. At Universidad de Monterrey, sustainability center staff track their sustainability progress in alignment with SDGs.

Ecological Grief: How Higher Education Responds to Environmental Trauma,"Grieving the loss or change of a cherished natural space has not always been recognized as a true form of grieving. With summers filled with smoke, devastating flooding, record-breaking hurricanes and subtle changes in the seasons, ecological grief is now starting to become recognized as a legitimate form of mourning and anxiety. This presentation provides a brief introduction to the concept of ecological grief, by highlighting the similarities and differences from other forms of grief. This discussion draws from 2016 field work conducted in the Ghost River Valley in Alberta, Canada, during a clearcut logging event. Following an introduction to the topic of ecological grief, this presentation will explore how post-secondary institutions can support the growing number of students and employees who may be experiencing environmental trauma and grief. How do we mentally and emotionally grapple with environmental change, not just mitigate and adapt? How can we support climate refugees?

Becoming a Social Organism: Action Research Turns Environmental Research Into a Sustainable Act,"""What is the impact of my work on the environment?"", asks designer and educator Victor Papanek in the first chapter of his revolutionary 1995 book, The Green Imperative. Papanek's words drive my teaching every day and lead me to question the meaning and purpose of contemporary sustainability research in education. I will present my research, a case study that takes place at Shenkar College of Engineering, Design and Art in Tel-Aviv, where I teach. The research is inspired by David Orr's approach that ""all education is environmental education"" and by Fritjof Capra's holistic view that life is a complex system that integrates organisms, social systems and ecosystems. I will show how an ordinary qualitative research study evolved into Action Research involving a group of twelve faculty members, who, by sharing their sustainable ideas, projects and curricula raised awareness of ecological and social issues through the power of art and design. The goal of the group was to prepare collective work for an exhibition on environmental issues, however through the creative process - meetings, acting, connecting and sharing - we gave birth to a new social organism that had a transformative effect on the members as teachers and individuals. Through audience participation I will demonstrate the concept of the interconnected system methodology and provide session participants with creative social tools to inspire their own research and teaching on their campuses and in their communities.",8636,,,,,,,Research,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,action research,10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Rakefet Kenaan,8636,Senior Lecturer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7919/1130_Kenaan_0340.pdf,,,
Microbial assessment of rainwater tanks and runoff retention basins: A pilot study,"Exploring the reuse potential of stormwater runoff and the roof-top rainwater, to meet water supply needs on the University campus is the core focus of this research. Although rainwater is generally considered clean, the potential of public health risk associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms cannot be ignored. Faeces of wild birds, insects, mammals and reptiles that have access to the roof can be washed into the holding tank during rain events. Main objective of the work is to characterize microbial quality of the collected rain/storm water on the campus to understand the presence-absence of 6 target pathogens - Shigella flexneri, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Legionella spp., L. pneumophila and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in correspondence with the fecal indicator organism - enterococci. A secondary objective is to test for drug resistance genes in the samples as that will allow us to profile for priority contaminants in the study samples. The study focuses on testing the water stored in 6 retention basins and 2 rainwater barrels on West Chester University (WCU) campus. The results of this study will provide baseline data to understand microbial threats to campus stored rainwater/runoff water. The study is currently ongoing and samples will be analyzed for target pathogens during Summer 2018.

Achieving Intertwined Sustainable Development Goals Through Coastal Resilience Research,"Sustainable policy, design, and visualization strategies are essential as climate change and sea level rise threaten coastal cities. Higher education institutions in coastal regions have the opportunity to conduct meaningful scholarly research and make a real difference in their communities by engaging these challenges. Norfolk, Virginia is experiencing some of the highest rates of sea level rise globally. Wetlands loss, hardened shorelines, and river dredging reduce coastal resilience and threaten human livelihoods and cultures. Through a stakeholder engagement process with the City of Norfolk and several NGO and community organizations, a trans-disciplinary University of Virginia research team of faculty and students developed adaptive design proposals for several vulnerable Norfolk neighborhoods. Using ecosystem services as a framework, they made informed decisions about environmental, socio-cultural, and aesthetic benefits. Integrated quantitative and qualitative methodologies valued assets not easily measured. Scenarios creatively combined natural and synthetic strategies for landscapes and buildings (eg. living shorelines, wetland inundation parks, floating and elevated buildings). Adaptive measures were designed as restorative and recreational public places that connect Norfolk residents with their river.

Transdisciplinary Undergraduate Research In Costa Rica: 5 Week Faculty Led Study Abroad Model,"This session explains the process and lessons learned as Central College (Pella, Iowa) faculty and staff developed undergraduate research opportunities within the model of a short-term faculty-led study abroad program in Costa Rica. This academically rigorous summer program focuses on a multitude of research areas related to the UN SDGs, including topics in health, wellness, and global sustainability; emphasizing the interconnectedness of environmental, ecological, social, political, and economic systems. Developed by faculty from English, Biology, and Exercise Science, the program was conceived with sustainability as a core theme connecting disciplines and increasing access to undergraduate research opportunities in departments that have traditionally had fewer, like those currently seen in the humanities. Vital to this last point, presenters will explain how they negotiated issues of research supervision and disciplinary authority in such a way that the program is open to students from multiple disciplines without forcing the program budget to absorb costs for multiple faculty supervisors traveling and living in-country. Additionally, the session will introduce best practices and ethical considerations for sustainability, study abroad, and community-based research. Presenters will describe a series of site visits and ongoing communications with communities and partner institutions in Costa Rica, which has been essential to establishing mutually beneficial relationships. Together, a coalition of students, faculty advisors, sustainability & study abroad staff, and local research hosts support the development of research questions that are of value not just to the students, but to the community in which the research will take place. This program also incorporates principles of fair-trade learning by encouraging students to proactively share their research findings with the local communities with whom they collaborate.",4371,,,,,,,Research,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,"study abroad,faculty",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Cierra Rustad,4371,Undergraduate Student,Sara Shuger Fox,4371,Assistant Professor of Exercise Science, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
WEB of Science Database: Sustainable Knowledge of the Hopi A Prototype for the Future Research,"The Hopi tribe of the US Southwest is the carrier of the traditional knowledge (TK) comprising the knowledge of sustainable living. The search of the Web of Science database has been performed to analyze the representation of the Hopi people in publications for the period from 1900 to 2016. The aim of the analysis was to reveal connections between the science and the Hopi sustainable practices. Data mining for the topic 'hopi' resulted in 670 available sources from the Core Collection with the 219 abstracts constituting the prototype of the corpus. The language patterns in the corpus were analyzed using Tableau, AncConc, and Sketchengine. The rise in number of publications starting 1990s indicates awakening of the interest to the Hopi theme with the main increase of publications in Geosciences. Based on the language patterns the observed trends in changes include a shift from the earlier image of the Hopi as an exotic object to the Hopi image as a subject, an informant, and a patient. The sampling concludes that the Hopi TK, the Hopi way of living and their remarkable sustainability practices do not have sufficient representation in the scientific publications.

Automated Gardening System with Solar Integration,"Industrialized agriculture has benefitted our society by feed billions but is also adding a burden to the environment. Inefficient watering techniques and indiscriminate use of chemicals in much of today's industrialized agriculture practices are not sustainable. Organic farming is an environmental friendly alternative, but with a catch-it is labor intensive and in many parts of the world, less cost competitive with industrialized agriculture. The Automated Gardening System with Solar Integration project, self-initiated by us undergraduate students from Carnegie Mellon University, aim to explore the use of robotics in agriculture. We, as a group of six, began our planning process during the fall of 2017. Researching different options to make a 2D planting system, we settled with a belt-conveyor design that is cost-effective for gardening. After building a computer model with the design, we began the building process by prototyping the 3D printed parts. We participated the Build18 electrical engineering hackathon at Carnegie Mellon during the first week of the Spring 2018 semester. During that week, we successfully built our 2 feet by 2 feet gantry system where a mount with a watering hose and camera is able to move in 2D space and dispense water at locations with plants. Currently, we are implementing a solar power integration so that this system will be functional in off-grid locations as well. Another exciting development is the use of computer vision to differentiate weeds from plants. This second prototype will also include a z-axis manipulator that could interact with the garden by poking selected weeds back into the soil and planting seeds from a seed reservoir. This project has gained attention during the showcase of the hackathon. This is a long term project and the group is excited about bring new developments to the system.

"From Bags to Boards: The Experimentation Behind the Recycled Building Material ""BagBoard""","In the United States alone, the EPA estimates that 380 BILLION plastic bags are used once and then discarded. The answer to this plastic plague may come from the small nonprofit, Full Belly Project, in Wilmington, North Carolina in the form of 'Bag Board.' Bag Board is one of their inventions created through a process of folding, heating, and compressing over 900 plastic bags into a solid board, comparable to an elementary school desktop or a thick piece of plywood. Bag Board is still in its experimental phase and the process of making it isn't perfect. I have been working to find the most efficient way to create the highest quality boards. I've taken risks and been rewarded but have also experienced setbacks and failures at every step in the creation process. Throughout the presentation I will explain the best methods, the worst failures, and the learning process that I have been though while creating Bag Board. Another topic that I will discuss is my findings on the safety of the Bag Board creation process as the idea of a board made of baked plastic bags, understandable, raises a flag to many who know plastic's toxic potential. The next step in Bag Board's story will be testing to see what environmental factors the board can withstand. These findings will be used to better understand the board's potential in the world of construction, creation, and environmental advancement. Bag Board's future is bright, but it needs more research behind it to get it off the ground. The audience members who attend will have gotten a chance to get up-close and personal with Bag Board, learned about the behind-the-scenes of its creation and get a glimpse into the exciting future of testing and product design that the board will be undergoing.",740,,,,,,,Research,Waste,,,,,,"recycling,upcycling,plastics,plastic bags,plastic reduction",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Megan Romanchok,740,Undergraduate Student,Kathryn Pohlman,740,Chief Sustainability Officer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9407/1430_Romanchok_0744.pptx,,,
"Living Housed, Healthily and Happily: Conceptualizing Disparaging Circumstances in Queer Communities","The data and implications aim to identify the meaning of social sustainability while highlighting issues within the field. LGBTQ communities are affected by many adverse circumstances and their lives can be harmed without basic day to day fundamentals like food and housing security. Historically, there have been no intentional records of lgbtq youth experience with respect to food and housing insecurity in the lowcountry of Charleston, SC ever before. With the collaboration of the College of Charleston Joseph P. Riley Center for Livable Communities and 'We Are Family', the only youth based lgbtq+ advocacy organization in the state of South Carolina. The Riley Center for Livable Communities and We Are Family developed a survey that would be administered to both College of Charleston students and local youth (under the age of 25) in order to asses their exact circumstances as they relate to both food and housing insecurity. The findings among College of Charleston students regarding inadequate housing and meals per week were alarming enough to gain the attention of the greater city officials and beg the question of what viable remedies could be implemented to eradicate these issues.Both We Are Family and The Riley Center have devised a 'street mapping' process to canvass areas throughout the county in search of housing insecure youth either in between homes in a transient state or visibly on the street. Currently there are no agencies that provide shelter directly for lgbtq+ youth in the area and compiling this research/ data will allow for the City of Charleston and partnering agencies to determine funds needed to be allocated towards linkage to healthcare and rapid rehousing for these housing and food insecure lgbtq youth. The collection of this data and the compiling of all implications will serve as a catalyst for the City of Charleston to develop policies and procedures concerning housing and food insecure lgbtq+ youth and better define the resources needed.",5047,,,,,,,Research,Wellbeing & Work,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,"food security,housing,LGBTQ",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Vanity Reid Deterville,5047,Student Advocate/ Intern, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
How University Transportation Practitioners are Transforming USGBC's Global Transportation Emphasis,"Transportation is the fastest growing source of global C02 emissions. Two years ago, the USGBC added Parksmart, a parking-structure and transportation certification program, into its suite of offerings. Universities have taken the lead on certifying new and existing parking structures - and in so doing have accelerated the engagement of architects, engineers, sustainability staff, and parking professionals in the transportation sustainability discussion. Universities and colleges have been recognized by Parksmart for higher and better land use through sustainable structures, demonstrated cost-savings arising from Parksmart practices, and increased campus access while reducing SOV trips. Additionally, a number of university parking and transportation professionals have inspired the USGBC to grow a broader systems-based approach to assessing, recognizing, and promoting sustainable parking and transportation programs. These leaders are collaborating with USGBC to identify the most effective system practices and metrics to reduce SOV use, promote active transportation, encourage more sustainable forms of mobility, and reduce CO2 and other transportation-caused emissions. This presentation will feature discussions by ASU, Cornell, MSCBA, Stanford, and the USGBC on the creative dynamic in play here.

From Cars to Bikes - A Campus Transformation,"The transformation of physical environments on college campuses typically comes in the form of a formal master planning effort with great vision and fanfare. BUT there are other, more granular, ways to re-shape our campuses. At Purdue University we have been using bike infrastructure and the complete streets approach as a similarly effective tool in the steady deconstruction of the car-centric campus. Our transition in the treatment of street work and repair away from the curb-to-curb mentality toward adopting the Complete Streets and Road Diet approaches have been very influential in our most recent and successful projects, the State Street Redevelopment Project and the Purdue Discovery Park District, providing key proofs of concept. The State Street Redevelopment Project is a $120M infrastructure collaboration between Purdue University and the City of West Lafayette to use the main connection from the Wabash River, through downtown, through the university, and out to the western gateway as an opportunity to stitch these communities together. The Purdue Discovery Park District is a $1.2B public-private partnership to develop the western gateway of Purdue's campus, building a community from scratch.

Sustainable for Your Bottom Line: Electric Buses and Simple Infrastructure for Your Campus Fleet.,"Campuses are growing and evolving, and with that, our transportation needs are changing. Now more than ever, we need smart solutions that provide safer, more reliable and cleaner transit. As we all know: When most engines burn fuel, they release harmful chemicals into the air. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and volatile organic compounds can all have a negative impact on your health day, electric buses are proving to meet those needs. The electric bus adoption rate is 10X that of electric passenger vehicles. This is the net steps in cleaning the air quality for our campuses. Electric buses are moving more people without a tailpipe than ever before! Transit agencies, Campuses, Airports and many commuter companies are moving towards all electric buses everyday. Revolutionary battery-electric buses help fleet operators abandon fossil fuels, improve environmental quality and reduce operating costs. Battery Electric Buses have proven themselves with millions of miles service in communities across North America, operating at a lower overall cost than any 35 or 40 foot diesel, hybrid or CNG transit vehicle. A revolution is taking place. The TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) saving of mainanace costs and fuel costs are proving to make battery electric transit for campuses a way to save money too! Many funding and leasing options now make it much easier to move to electrifying your campus fleet. Learn how to engage your utility, plan for a simple infrastructure, energy storage and renewable energy, while saving money and reducing your GHG emissions. What is learned froths clean transportation program could then be unitized as a curriculum for transportation, renewable energy, and environmental education.

Environmental Impact and Cost Savings Data for Low Speed Electric Vehicles on College Campuses,"In this discussion we will review environmental and financial data from two separate universities that have reduced their carbon footprint and the cost of their campus fleet operations through the use of low speed, plug-in electric vehicles. The data collected comes from two different universities that have begun the process of converting their fleets over to low speed electric vehicles. We will share environmental data, collected from telematics devices, that shows how much CO2 emissions are being reduced. Additional metrics will demonstrate the cost of acquiring vehicles as part of a regular rotation of replacing aged vehicles and the reduced cost of vehicle maintenance and operations. We will also share low cost options for evaluating a campus fleet's performance. Many institutions of higher education across the country are leading the way to a more sustainable future by striving to meet demanding sustainability goals and mandates set by school administrations and state governments. As managers tackle the problems associated with campus fleets they come face-to-face with the extreme upfront purchase costs that come with plug-in electric cars, hybrids, and alternatively fueled vehicles. This approach will increase the cost of fleet management in an era where most public higher education institutions are still seeing budget shortfalls. That means increased transportation costs will reduce funding in other areas of campus operations.",8165,,,,,,,Transportation,Air & Climate,,,,Transportation & Parking,,"electric vehicles,fleet management",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Aaron Stegemann,8165,Director of Strategic Accounts, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10447/0830_Stegemann_1111.pptx,,,
A Sustainable Parking Framework and Strategies to Encourage More Sustainable Transportation,"Thompson Rivers University (TRU) is transitioning from a commuter campus to an urban campus with a vibrant heart. Guiding the process are strategic sustainable priorities consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11: 'Sustainable Cities and communities'. The Campus Master Plan, which provides guidelines for future development on campus, outlines key principles to densify the core of campus: replacing surface parking lots with a mix of academic, commercial and residential spaces to enhance the 24/7 usability of campus.. A key step in achieving this longer term vision was to transform from a campus where single-occupancy vehicles (SOV) dominated to a campus where alternate transportation becomes the norm. The Campus Strategic Sustainability Plan (CSSP) and the Sustainable Parking Framework (SPF), detailed below, have paved the way for change. Transportation, an important section of the CSSP, has 16 wide-ranging initiatives and strategies to reduce GHGs and improve air quality. These include implementing alternate transportation options such as ride sharing programs, car share services, and bike share programs, and improving bicycle facilities (showers storage). The CSSP also identifies ways to reduce SOVs from entering campus, such as telecommuting and improved pedestrian design. The SPF outlines a tiered system with economy lots on the campus perimeter, general parking zones, and reserved stalls in the campus core.",1431,,,,,,,Transportation,Air & Climate,,,,Transportation & Parking,,"parking,single occupancy vehicles",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Aaron Wiebe,1431,Research Assistant,James Gordon,1431,Environmental Programs & Research Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10116/1045_Wiebe_0398.pptx,,,
Designing Despite the Department of Transportation,"In a state, South Caroline, that is lacking in alternative transportation infrastructure and can barely maintain the infrastructure, how can a place of higher learning creative transportation? Most roads in Charleston, SC are owned by the state which means that changes and maintenance go through the Department of Transportation, DOT. Non-DOT streets are maintained by the City of Charleston. Both of them allow for the College of Charleston certain rights to the streets on and around the College of Charleston. So when the College of Charleston cannot physically change the infrastructure surrounding it, it must design a way to change the campus communities behavior when it comes to commuting to campus. Starting from freshman year and progressing to graduation, the College should use certain incentives to give students the ability to navigate without the use of a car. The College already has some facilities in place like a free bike share and free transit passes for students, and staff. Next step is surveying the community to discover what is needed to allow more people to use alternative transportation. Further the College can use negative reinforcement with accessibility and policy to make driving to campus less of an option. The final step is collaboration in innovation. As an institution we have many creative minds that should work together by facilitating inter-departmental working groups, task forces, or committees. Design students working with physics students to create interesting solar panel bus hubs where students can charge their phones or public health and exercise science students creating an app that traffics the benefit of walking to class. The College can use tactical urbanism to make alternative transportation the better option like painting crosswalks to bring beauty along with awareness to them.",5047,,,,,,,Transportation,Campus Engagement,,,,Transportation & Parking,,alternative transportation,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Eliza Bower,5047,Graduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Alternative Transportation in the Rural Context,"SUNY Cortland and other smaller comprehensive colleges function as economic drivers to the local economy, and especially in the case of smaller colleges located in more rural settings. In this context, what options do institutions have to leverage economic activity, encourage accessible alternative transportation, and reduce our carbon footprint while expanding our transportation options and increasing participation? SUNY Cortland was one of the first in the state system to offer a community bike program to encourage sharing and point to point use on campus. Like many campuses, we also offer Zipcar as a means to provide other options for those slightly longer trips where the campus bus loop does not go. As we investigate plans for future improvements to our internal operations and enhance economic partnerships, can we offer alternatives to enable increase use of electric vehicles, or potentially more common car-pool / van-pool options? How have other campuses facilitated the economic partnerships to benefit the broader community? Does size matter in this quest for enabling greater adoption of alternative modes of transit, as we move towards the post-carbon economy? Come share your experience in an open facilitated dialogue of case studies, mutual aspirations, and campus engagement.",1427,,,,,,,Transportation,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"alternative transportation,rural focus",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Matthew Brubaker,1427,Campus Energy Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9500/1430_Brubaker_0870.pdf,,,
The Case Study of Universal Transit Pass (U-Pass) Programs at Eight US Universities,"Many universities across the US address sustainability on campus and aim at reducing the environmental footprint. Universities' strategies to reduce the carbon footprint include promoting alternative modes of travel, such as walking, biking, taking transit, carpooling, and van pooling, to reduce the amount and impacts of single occupancy vehicle (SOV) trips within transportation, along with other strategies, such as the use of renewable energy sources and cogeneration, recycling and composting, and campus gardening. In particular, a number of universities has adopted universal transit pass (U-pass), which is a transportation demand management program to provide free or substantially discounted transit service to students, faculty, and/or staff of the university, and reduce SOV commuting and parking demand on campus. In addition to environmental benefits, U-Pass programs also address the equity in accessibility. In this study, we examine U-pass programs at eight universities in the US regarding the types of U-pass program, costs and financing, effective discount rates, governance, and planning process. We conduct a study with particular attentions on: (1) the cost to the students and university, (2) contractual terms with the transit agency or agencies involving timing and funding, and (3) the governance and planning procedure that led to the successful implementation of the U-pass programs. Particularly, it is critical for a university to understand both the financial impacts of the members of campus community and the effectiveness of U-pass program in achieving its sustainability objectives, and communicate and negotiate with a transit agency regarding the payment and the level of transit service provided. Based on the study findings, we provide a set of factors to be evaluated and recommendations of the procedure and steps to be taken toward a successful implementation of U-pass program.",1712,,,,,,,Transportation,Public Engagement,,,,,,"u-pass,public transit",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Mark Stewart,1712,Sustainability Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
"Mitigating Air Travel Emissions: Measuring, Pricing and Collaboration","Presenters will discuss their approaches to tracking airline miles, estimating emissions, and counter-acting these emissions. Carbon neutral air travel requires data availability to accurately estimate emissions, but perhaps a larger barrier is identifying consistent funding to offset these emissions into the future. Presenting schools UCLA, Arizona State University and University of Maryland are the first schools in the US to implement a carbon surcharge on university air travel to fund emission reduction projects on-campus and annual offset purchases. Each school will present how they have navigated internal politics and public procurement processes to collect funding and retire offsets to address their annual emissions. Each school will discuss the structure chosen for their air travel fees and how the collected funds are utilized.

Vermicompost: A Study of Alternative Composting in Arid Climates,"Traditional composting methods will often yield a nutrient-rich fertilizer. However, when such methods are performed in an arid climate, such as the Sonoran Desert, additional precautions must be taken to ensure quality. These steps can vary from methods of covering windrows of compost with tarps, to turning and spraying water into compost piles with heavy machinery. Yet, when water resources are precious, or the equipment to water the compost becomes unavailable, other methods of composting must be assessed. Vermicompost, the composting process utilizing worms to aid in the breakdown of organic materials, may provide an alternate solution to compost producers when water resources are scarce. This study will analyze a vermicompost operation being performed in the Tucson area by the University of Arizona's cooperative extension program, Compost Cats. The study will take an engineering approach to subjects including the system modeling, sensory analysis, and data analytics of the vermicomposting process - as well as an assessment of the quality of the compost produced. Additionally, the data from this study will help provide a basis for larger-scale operations of vermicomposting in desert climates.",4465,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"vermiculture,compost",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Ryan Yamauchi,4465,"Student, Compost Cats",Daniel Quinn,4465,Compost Cats - Equipment Specialist, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Sustaining the Borderlands: A Discussion on Food Waste in the Southwest,"Tucson, Arizona is situated 60 miles from the United States/Mexico International border. The nearest port of entry, Nogales, is one of the largest landlocked ports in North America. This port is responsible for funneling one quarter of the U.S. total fresh produce imports. This volume of import means a significant loss of organics -- 4,000 pounds out of every one million pounds of food that crosses the Nogales port of entry are sent to the landfill. A loss of produce represents organic material that must be sent to a landfill where the anoxic conditions accelerate the emission of methane gas, the most potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. This concerns the University of Arizona (UA) Compost Cats , who work to divert food waste from the landfill and provide commercial composting for more than 60 local businesses in the Tucson area. The UA Compost Cats have been successful in diverting over one million pounds of organics from the Los Reales landfill each year. Compost Cats partners with the City of Tucson to provide an alternate way to dispose of compostable bio waste for grocery stores, local businesses, community functions, as well as brush from city landscape maintenance. Expansion of this system of food waste diversion and philosophy of community sustainability is in the future for Compost Cats. The Fresh Produce Association of America recognizes the need to divert organics from the landfill and expresses interest in partnering with the UA Compost Cats to create a similar operation in Rio Rico, Arizona, less than 15 miles from the Nogales port of entry. This session will focus on the realities faced by commercial composting initiatives in the borderlands of the southwest.",4465,,,,,,,Waste,Public Engagement,,,,,,"food waste,compost",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Grace McGuire,4465,"Operations Manager, UA Compost Cats",Daniel Quinn,4465,Compost Cats - Equipment Specialist,Hunter Oldham,4465,Student,Chester Phillips,4465,Senior Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Zero Waste Campus: Mitigating Landfill Waste on an Urban College Campus,"Charleston, South Carolina is a coastal city that is home to the College of Charleston, an integrated city campus. As the city is on the forefront to experiencing rising sea level and intensifying storms, we intend to share how the College is taking a stand to mitigating its contribution to climate change for a sustainable future. Through the College's Office of Sustainability, our Zero Waste initiative is intended to help the College divert ≥90% of its waste from the landfill into either compost or recycling by 2030. The origin of Zero Waste at the College of Charleston draws heavily on the elements of Cradle to Cradle, a book by Michael Braungart and William McDonough that advises industries to follow biomimicry, where waste breaks down into biological and technical nutrients that will either be of environmental use or continue on a closed loop industrial cycle. The Office of Sustainability has since adopted this model and redesigned its philosophy by adding a Zero Waste Corps program that comprises of four student interns who lead individual projects, such as: infrastructural innovation, campus events, specialty recycling, and on-campus housing waste reduction. These interns work with other organizations and have various objectives such as special materials recycling, campus system redesign, and social outreach. Each intern works with the Office's goal for sustainable campus development by ensuring responsible consumption and education for all college affiliates. Asides from developing a more sustainable campus, this program teaches its interns to work collaboratively, analytically, and professionally to prepare them for their intended careers.",5047,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,,zero waste,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Neyle Steadman,5047,"Student, Office of Sustainability",Lauren Gabbamonte,5047,Undergraduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Utilizing Waste Management Plans in Residence Halls: A Case Study,"In large universities, waste and recycling can be a daunting task to take on and fix. At the University of South Carolina, there are 28 residence halls, all built slightly different, each endowed with their own challenges. By adopting a waste management plan like those seen in construction, buildings can address their specific problems while compiling data that is meaningful and uniform across campus. The plan includes a residential student, full time staff and housing custodial team sections. Due to the recycling crisis, landfill costs, increased hauler fees and more, this topic is very timely and one that we are faced with on a global scale. By having a waste management plan, university housing services can more effectively address specific issues, and target specific ways to reduce trash and recycle as they come up in each building. With the Theme of 'Global Goals: Rising to the Challenge,' This topic is very timely and hopefully a tool many housing coordinators can take back to their campuses to implement and inform their future work.",4756,,,,,,,Waste,Coordination & Planning,,,,Housing & Residence Life,,"residence halls,waste plans",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Laura Anne Hunt,4756,Housing Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Expanding the Horizons of Campus Recycling: Assessing Expanded Polystyrene Waste in Higher Education,"College and university campuses strive to minimize waste and promote thoughtful disposal practices among campus residents. However, one material that presents unique challenges to responsibly manage is expanded polystyrene (EPS), a plastic often referred to as Styrofoam. Valued for its structural and insulating properties, EPS is used in shipping containers for sensitive products in research laboratories. These properties become problematic once on campus, as the material cannot be included among plastics in recycling programs. Thus, EPS containers often are sent to landfill after a single use, to the consternation of laboratory staff and campus services employees. However, institutions of higher education can serve as proving grounds for novel waste management initiatives. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, students and staff have partnered with local actors to develop an EPS recycling program, successfully diverting EPS from landfill and extending its useful life. This program and its characteristics were featured in a session at the 2017 AASHE conference, with discussion focusing on lessons, ideas, and applications for institutions interested in mitigating EPS waste through approaches that employ the circular economy. This year's session will reprise the topic of EPS recycling and address an unanswered question from the 2017 conference: what are the environmental and economic outcomes of EPS waste mitigation practices? The presentation will be informed by the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the UW-Madison EPS recycling program. The LCA uses SimaPro software and measures the cradle-to-grave impacts of EPS across ten environmental categories. The LCA also assesses economic costs associated with the three disposal scenarios of landfill, recycling, and reuse. Discussion will revisit topics from the 2017 conference but focus on the implications of the LCA results for institutions engaged or interested in EPS recycling and reuse schemes.",4058,,,,,,,Waste,,,,,,,"styrofoam,recycling,life cycle assessment",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Tim Lindstrom,4058,Graduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9104/1430_Lindstrom_0414.pptx,,,
"Using Waste Audit Data to Drive Waste Reduction, Diversion, and Engagement","Unlike other utilities, such as electricity and natural gas, actual waste and recycling data are more difficult to track. The lack of ready to use data creates challenges in goal setting and tracking. Waste audits used to extrapolate this data are generally a onetime exercise. Collecting this data periodically involves creating a unique system that works in the local conditions of your institution. However, data without a plan is a waste of resources. Waste audits can fall into this trap so having a strategy for how audit data will be used is critical for success. Presenters will use the learnings from three different types of academic institutions to briefly discuss the many ways waste data can be collected and share how that data was used at their respective institutions to enact change. The four presenters will highlight how waste characterizations and audits do not have to be standalone assessments, that there is much to learn from collected data, and that these studies can be used to educate and engage the community and campus leaders, moving an institution's program towards greater reduction and diversion through a thoughtful process. This presentation will help the audience learn how to build engagement into the audit process, get feedback as a strategy is developed for applying the data, and set the program up for success in implementing change.

Thinking Outside of the Trash: Waste Policy Implementation and Education at Emory University,"Emory University consulted with Cascadia and Burns & McDonnell during 2016-2017 to assess Emory's materials management program and make recommendations for innovative and programmatic strategies to help Emory achieve its goal of 95% landfill diversion by 2025. Emory's first step after the consultants' work concluded was to create and seek approval for a new waste policy that removed landfill bins from exterior spaces, removed desk-side service of waste bins, standardized interior and exterior waste bins across campus, and established a new team of waste specialists to service the new system. This initiative is led by Emory Recycles, the Office of Sustainability Initiatives, Building & Residential Services, the Environmental Health & Safety Office, and the Planning Design & Construction departments. Emory University committed to this initiative to be a local leader and champion of SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities - and SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-Being.

We end with an exercise on power-mapping and discussing how students can take steps to implement change on their campuses: who to talk to, how to conduct those types of conversations, and where to turn when they face hurdles and challenges along the way.",6582,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,zero waste,10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Faye Christoforo,6582,"Co-Director, Campus Coordinator", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
A Residential Recycling Competition at Skidmore College,"Energy conservation competitions are a cornerstone project in many schools' outreach efforts, and this program utilized a similar approach to address apartment waste patterns. This recycling and compost-oriented competition involved on-campus apartments, which are often excluded from engagement efforts that focus on residence halls. The Village Recycling Competition (VRC) fostered collaboration with our waste hauler, provided insights to waste receptacle infrastructure, and bolstered support for the student-run composting program. This presentation explores the process, logistics, and takeaways from the Skidmore College Sustainability Office's two-month recycling competition. The VRC pitted two apartment villages against each other, including 22 buildings of about 1,000 junior and senior residents total. It was primarily organized by a team of six peer-to-peer education student employees. The programming cultivated awareness and behavior change with students that will be on campus for months or semesters to come, and yielded a survey to direct future educational outreach efforts and improve infrastructure that will be useful for years. Moving the needle on waste diversion in residential areas is a challenge across many campuses, including ours. The average recycling rate for Skidmore College is 30% for 2017, but the recycling rate within the apartment villages ranges from 10-30% month to month (this rate reflects routine zero-sort recycling and the MSW stream). This programming provided insight to behaviors and trends in the villages, which we incorporated into our educational materials through the competition and will inform our outreach in coming semesters. Skidmore College is a small, private liberal-arts college in upstate New York.",4696,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"competitions,recycling",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jennifer Natyzak,4696,Sustainability Coordinator for Student Programs, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9123/1430_Natyzak_0461.pdf,,,
Western State Colorado University Role in Advancing SDGs- Road Map to Institutionalizing Zero Waste,"Higher education plays critical roles in the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). More specifically, higher education should strategically strive in its physical operations in advancing the attainment of both SDG 12 (Sustainable consumption and production patterns) and SDG 13 (Urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts) through various measures despite limited budget. Such measures could include urgent actions (promoting zero waste culture) that will address the issue of climate change in achieving the Paris Agreement to hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2oC and to pursue efforts to limit the rise to 1.5 oC. At Western State Colorado University during the 2015-16 academic session, eight graduate students in the Master in Environmental Management program in partnership with Facilities, conducted a campus-wide waste audit with their results showing a diversion rate of 24% despite existing infrastructure being able to handle up to 72%. This led to strategically identifying several target areas for increased waste reduction. A year later, the President of the University institutionalized a goal to be a zero-waste campus (85-90% diversion rate) by year 2020. This meant that departments must ensure they minimize waste and recycle as much as possible to increase overall diversion. Collaboration efforts were intensified among three major departments (Residence Life, Athletics and Facilities) to pilot this process during the 2016-17 academic and results showed that diversion rates increased to 55-62% across those departments which increased the overall campus diversion rate to 35%. Another focused effort occurred in October 2017 when the University sought and was awarded a $25,000 RREO Mini-Grant from the State of Colorado to upgrade its recycling infrastructure. This will allow the purchase of new recycling bins with better labeling and education to further advance the zero-waste campaign goals.",1869,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"zero waste,waste audits,receptacles,waste diversion",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Ayodeji Oluwalana,1869,Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Accessible and Ethical E-Waste: Adaptability in Infrastructure,"This presentation is a case study on implementing an accessible and ethical e-waste system in UC Berkeley, where previously no affordable options had been available to students despite the hundreds of tons of e-waste the campus generates annually. The focus will be on how a program can be modular, especially in the face of limited funding and the transient nature of college campuses. The Zero Waste Research Center under the Student Environmental Resource Center is working on a solution to this problem. We have created an ethical and accessible system that can run on minimal resources. It relies heavily on student group and stakeholder interaction to ensure that our e-waste recycling program is constantly being updated to meet the campus's evolving needs. For collection, we will install bins in strategic locations in the residence halls and student union buildings. This will also be the basis of a map of e-waste collection sites with tagged data on the volume and type of waste we are receiving, as the university has not published data about its e-waste diversion since 2013. We are also screening our e-waste recycling partners to ensure that their process is both local and ethical, because we believe that the externalities of our waste should not simply be shifted to marginalized communities. Although we aim for biweekly pickups, there is a huge influx of e-waste when students move out. This is a problem unique to college campuses.",4473,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"e-waste,recycling",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Scott Silva,4473,Zero Waste Research Center Lead,Jenny Chiu,4473,Zero Waste Research Associate / Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
From Diversion to Prevention: Re-imagining Waste,"This is a story of a campus that has moved from seeing waste as merely a municipal bylaw, to diversion targets, and is now moving toward re-imagining waste as a tool for empowerment. Join this discussion to explore how to engage strategic allies like Human Resources professionals, videographers, and inquirers in the waste prevention journey. How can we begin to see waste as more than a Facilities Department responsibility, toward an initiative that can be built on collaboration, shared language, and experimentation? This presentation draws on pilot projects, including waste 'display cases', a cross-departmental 'Rapid Improvement Event', and a Repair Café to emphasis the experimental nature of waste aversion. This discussion uses a social innovation lens to build on traditional waste diversion initiatives toward initiatives that use design thinking and 'Lean' thinking to tackle problems collaboratively.",6424,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"waste reduction,waste diversion",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Amy Spark,6424,Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10244/1400_Spark_1082.pdf,,,
Off-Campus Student Housing Recycling Program,"Over 68 percent of students at the University of Nebraska Lincoln live in off-campus student housing, and many are conforming to the trend of residing in luxury student apartments. In an attempt to market to college students, apartment complexes offer workout rooms, pools, tanning beds, game rooms, study rooms, and an exclusive environment in which students can continue to live with students off of the university campus. In Lincoln, luxury apartment buildings have developed rapidly and can house thousands of students. While many of these apartments offer concierge trash services, none offered recycling services. Due to resources allocated by the University, the corporations that own their respected apartments, and the City of Lincoln, recycling in these apartments is being made possible. Though these apartments are unaffiliated with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the Environmental Sustainability Committee passed legislation through the Associated Students of University Nebraska-Lincoln that encouraged the development of recycling services in these apartment buildings. Unlike regular student government projects, we worked largely with the corporations that own the luxury student apartments. We also developed a relationship with the city of Lincoln, who was able to offer monetary incentives and assistance to the apartment buildings. The importance of net-working and community in sustainability efforts can not be understated.",3610,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,Housing & Residence Life,,"housing,recycling",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Veronica Parish,3610,Undergraduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

"Fats, Oils and Grease - 'Don't Flush It'","Georgia College & State University (GC) in partnership with the City of Milledgeville's Waste Water Treatment Program in Milledgeville, GA, have joined to educate the campus community on waste disposal through tabling events, orientation sessions and tours, stressing what not to dispose of down the drain. The play 'Don't Flush It', written by GC alum Nevada McPherson for the Shades of Green Program, specifically, addresses the Fats, Oils and Grease, known as F.O.G., disposal issue and is a fun and humorous opening for the topic. The Office of Sustainability and the Office of Environmental Health & Safety and Fire Safety will continue the dialog on the environmental and financial concerns for the campus community as well as describe the events that take place on campus to help educate on contamination and prevention. The City of Milledgeville's Waste Water Treatment Program will follow with a summary of their practices as well as with tips and suggestions on contamination and prevention for the greater community.

Engaging College Students With Sustainability and Human Rights Through Bottles and Cans,"The subject of my presentation will be UCan, a not-for-profit recycling system I launched as a first-year student at Colgate University in the Fall of 2017. UCan is a recycling system for universities and urban settings that collects, recycles, and redeems $0.05 deposit beverage containers and donates all proceeds to local hunger and homelessness outreach programs, such as affordable housing projects. Simply by disposing of beverage containers in UCan receptacles installed throughout campus, students learn about, support, and advocate for local environmental and human rights issues. At Colgate, over 40 UCan receptacles are installed in over 15 residential and academic buildings. Every week a team of student volunteers transports beverage containers from buildings to the redemption center, where containers are redeemable for cash. Then, UCan donates all proceeds to nonprofit organizations surrounding the participating university that directly serve and empower local homeless communities, and guide them through the process of safely transitioning out of homelessness, such as community-based affordable housing projects and hunger relief. The subject of the proposal is unique because it was founded with a two-fold mission: first, an environmental agenda to increase recycling rates at universities where bottle and can waste is produced in especially high quantities; second, a social agenda to help alleviate poverty in the area surrounding a university using the human resources, innovative spirits, and social awareness at the university's disposal. The presentation will focus on UCan Colgate's impact upon the surrounding city Utica, which is the 6th most distressed city in the United States with a poverty rate of 43%. Also, UCan's social media collaboration with the national recycling competition RecycleMania at Cornell University will be covered as well.",4155,,,,,,,Waste,Public Engagement,,,,,,"human rights,recycling,homelessness",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Christina Weiler,4155,Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9412/1430_Weiler_0748.pdf,,,

We'll chart out a years' worth of ideas to reduce what ends up in the landfill, and then dive into the details. We'll take a holistic view, and discuss ideas for engaging students, faculty and staff, share examples for communications, and strategies for dealing with common problems. We'll share examples from developing a recycling and trash bin standard, expanding the Green Move In and Green Move Out programs, creating programming for America Recycles Day, hosting a RecycleMania Game Day Challenge, trying out a Weigh the Waste campaign in the dining hall. In addition to the success stories, we'll also discuss defeats, share areas for improvement, and discuss opportunities for developing new norms on campus.

Achieving Zero Waste and Campus-Wide Compost Bins: Progress from Swarthmore College,"In 2017, Swarthmore College formalized its commitment to achieving a Zero Waste campus, with an interim goal of reaching an 80% diversion rate by 2022. This ambitious commitment, which built off of growing energy around composting and a developing need for a centralized campus waste yard, has since accelerated the College's waste innovations - placing it among other leaders of sustainable waste management in Pennsylvania and small liberal arts colleges nationwide, if not among the broader higher education community as well. We hope to share the progress that Swarthmore's program has made, offer a selection of tips and pitfalls, and solicit feedback from peer Zero Waste institutions. Swarthmore's recent waste initiatives include: -> Research and implementation of a standardized, campus-wide bin system. Each new 'waste station' has a color-coded set of compost (green), mixed recycling (blue), and incinerator trash (black) bins, with associated signage and other 'nudges' to encourage best sorting behavior. -> An educational campaign, developed by student researchers, to target ALL community members and - eventually - to ensure that every individual receives waste sorting training. -> A process for departments to volunteer to transition to Buddy Bins in office spaces, replacing traditional personal trash and recycling cans. -> Early development of designs for a centralized waste yard and associated staffing, landscape, and programmatic changes. -> Immense collaboration among departments of sustainability, custodial operations, auxiliary services, communications, and many more to identify unified strategies and visions.",3879,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"compost,zero waste,receptacles",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Christopher Proctor,3879,Sustainability Staff, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Engaging Housekeeping Staff for Zero Waste Success,"Contamination of single-stream recycling is one of the most significant obstacles to waste diversion. While campus culture promotes recycling, users do not reliably recycle correctly. The result is a contaminated recycling stream that does not meet strict guidelines set by the local MRF. To reduce contamination and increase waste diversion, Ohio State developed a program to leverage the unique position of housekeeping staff, which plays an integral role on the success of recycling efforts. Oftentimes, they are the first point of contact for student education about recycling and waste disposal guidelines. Housekeeping staff also play a crucial part on reducing waste contamination when sorting materials for pick up from buildings. This session will describe Ohio State's partnership with housekeeping staff to engage them to become educated ambassadors to the community, and be part of the university's effort to become a Zero Waste campus by the year 2025. Strategies that will be discussed include the development of a communications plan that addresses gaps in the staff's knowledge about recycling guidelines, and ways to communicate with native and non-native speaking staff. Presenters will share examples of recycling information provided at staff meetings, description of in-depth training, and a newly developed staff recognition program.

In this networking session, ZWRC at UCB will host students, staff, and faculty involved in zero waste research at their universities to have a discussion about the future of zero waste and how our work can serve as a model for the waste industry to handle waste resources more economically and efficiently. This networking meeting will give attendees a unique conference experience by connecting those who are working on innovative waste management practices, and allow for an exchange of ideas that can lead to solutions at other schools. We also hope to highlight the importance of a diversity of opinions and knowledge in zero waste projects through asking audience members to consider their project stakeholders and consider ways in which they can include more points of view in their work and teams.

How Might we Create a Sustainable Make-A-Thon to Inform Students About Sustainable Design?,"Design U every year puts on the 10,000 makes 24 hour Make-A-Thon where we bring in engineers, designers, business students and whoever else wants to join to essentially make something new. We start by giving them a how might we statement which goes along with our yearly theme. This year we chose Sustainability and Upcycling. This year the 10 Thousand Makes Make-A-Thon will took place in Ralph Rapson hall, which houses Architecture, and Design. The event happened on March 23 from 5:30-9:30 PM and March 24th 8:30 AM-7:30 PM. Up until this year sustainability has not been our main focus in Design U. Overall in the University of Minnesota College of Design, it isn't encouraged that students think of sustainable design, it is like we haven't even thought about it. As a team we sat down and had to think about our mission, we mainly wanted to think about impact and make sure that the Make-A-Thon would change how people perceive design, engineering and business. We decided to eliminate the plethora of resources and the individual teams budget to buy materials from Home Depot that the participants had in years past and use solely the reuse and recycling center on campus to get materials. All students were given a pile of reused/recycled materials to build their products from with few adhesives and all the tools from our wood shop, metal shop, and other labs on campus. This year alone we anticipated 70 participants, 14 teams and 14 mentors. We also reached out to key facility to mentor and assist the teams in making of their products. We had to think during our planning how might we keep Sustainability the focus of the event? We had meetings with the University of Minnesota Office of Sustainability who focus on direction and coordination for sustainability initiatives in the Twin Cities. They connected us to the reuse and recycling centers on campus to get materials for the Make-A-Thon but also gave us advice on making the event a road to zero waste.",32,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"upcycling,do-it-yourself (DIY)",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jessica Foor,32,Graphic Designer, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

We welcome educators, students, waste haulers, food service workers, communicators, and anyone else with an interest in compost to join the conversation. We will use compost production as a metaphor for the workshop learning process. The meeting will open with a brief case study to 'establish the culture of the compost pile.' University of Wisconsin-Madison staff will share how their university has taken a systems approach to addressing contamination in its food waste collection stream: working with stakeholders throughout the process. We will then turn to an activity to get a sense for who is in the room: 'assess our compost ingredients: our greens and browns.' This activity will give us information about the geographic distribution, experience with campus compost initiatives, and types of institutions represented in the group in order to start building connections between participants. Next, the group will generate questions related to campus compost initiatives. Each will be written on a sheet of flip chart paper and posted around the room. These will be our 'compost piles.'

Using Waste Reduction Technology to Adopt a Circular Economy,"This presentation will focus on waste management and the new shift to a circular economy. We will investigate the environmental and economic opportunities of a circular economy. We will study what this will look like along the entire make-use-dispose process, from resource extraction, processing, design, manufacturing, distribution, usage and finally disposal. The importance of improving resource productivity will be examined, designing products so that they can be reintroduced into the process as resources to create further value, while simultaneously minimizing and eliminating waste. We will also examine jurisdictions that have already successfully adopted a circular economy, we will look at what this will look like for our future and economy as we make this transition. We will investigate how cutting-edge technology is helping to fuel the shift to a circular economy. We will learn about the Resource Center, which is a free new software program that allows institutions to track and manage their refuse within their buildings at the container level. It acts as a roadmap to a better recycling program and a higher diversion rate, for no cost and can be accessed by anyone. This technology allows institutions to divide their organization up into divisions to separately track and direct waste management strategies to where they are most needed. The Resource Center takes a systematic approach, with attention to detail and lets institutions dive deep to see their progress in waste management, while making the transition to a circular economy more attainable for all.",6513,,,,,,,Waste,,,,,,,"circular economy,waste reduction,recycling",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Syvannah Vine,6513,Waste Diversion Specialist, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,

Resource Management Contracting- How It Can All Go Wrong When You Do Everything Right,"With stagnant recycling and diversion rates, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee sought to get aggressive with its haulers, data collection, and its plan for waste reduction. UWM set out to achieve a 50% diversion rate by substantially reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse beyond its average performance. By taking value from energy conservation's 'performance contracting' playbook, UWM put together an incentive-based approach to waste & recycling contracts, disrupting Milwaukee's hauling market. Early preparations involved peer to peer interviews, extensive community and campus stakeholder engagement, and third-party contracting. After setting out with high hopes, the program started to crumble within the first 6 months as contracts were sold, multi-departmental accounting problems unfurled, and service issues compiled, literally. All assumptions before and after laid to waste. This process exposed unaccounted for time invested in servicing the contracts and how challenging it is to build a program on cost savings alone. By exposing where the time and costs truly lie, UWM has been able to learn, reflect, and recoup with an even stronger, institutionalized process for aggressive waste diversion.",4059,,,,,,,Waste,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"waste reduction,waste diversion",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Kate Nelson,4059,Chief Sustainability Officer,John Gardner,4059,Sustainability Policy & Planning Analyst,Laura Stevens,4059,Solid Waste and Recycling Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7892/0830_Gardner_0311.pptx,,,
Zero-Waste Initiative: Composting at Events,"Public events tend to be extremely wasteful. When a county fair, culinary festival, fundraising campaign, or community garden potluck are organized, the overall aim is to create an enjoyable atmosphere. The issue of waste accumulation is not necessarily the primary focus. For the sake of immediacy, waste coordination of these events usually does not include the incorporation of services outside of landfill bins. Though recycling services are even less represented, the least considered waste service is that of organics diversion, or compost. Working for the University of Arizona Compost Cats has afforded the ability to facilitate many partnerships between local events and a student-operated commercial composting facility. The University of Arizona is located in Tucson, Arizona, which is a UNESCO City of Gastronomy. Since culinary events regularly occur within Tucson, the Compost Cats have been able to emerge within the events scene as a resource for providing compost bins and coaching to events staff. This involvement has led to a deeper discussion surrounding the perception of food waste within our communities. Most people who attend events in Tucson have never been exposed to the option of separating their leftover food from their plastic silverware and styrofoam plates, for example. The education of the public on the importance of compost is approached through the use of eco-stations which are monitored by volunteers or employees.",4465,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,Public Engagement,,,,,"compost,zero waste,events",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Grace McGuire,4465,"Operations Manager, UA Compost Cats",Kayenat Aryeh,4465,Undergraduate Student,Samantha Normandia,4465, UA Compost Cats, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Reducing Odorous Emissions from Compost With Bio Filters,"In 2014 Thompson Rivers University published its campus Sustainability Action plan that identified priorities to become a green campus. Zero waste was identified as a major priority, including the capturing of roughly 500 tones of organic waste a year. To this end, a composting program was created with two industrial Joracan composters, chosen for their high-speed computerized operation. Initially, the composters were in the Culinary arts building to provide easy access for kitchen and food scraps but after about a year, the machines began to produce odors; additionally, there were growing pains with compost collection in the form of fruit flies. If compost was not removed from an area quickly enough fruit flies would reach annoyingly high levels, this was initially solved using vinegar fly traps but is less of an issue now with more frequent pickups. The smell remained a more significant issue and proved harder to solve, after consulting Joracan, master composters, and having the machines regularly steam cleaned, nothing proved to be a permanent solution. Even after moving the composters to their own enclosed space, the exhaust from the machine often exceeded tolerable levels and the new location put the machine next door to campus daycare. By 2017, efforts to achieve zero waste were well underway, but the smell from the compost was causing complaints from staff, children, and concerned parents. With an end to the program looming over nuisance complaints the search to find a reliable, long term filtration option had already begun. After extensive market research, it was concluded that there was no economically viable commercial solution to this problem and research began on the concept of bio-filtration. Two filters were constructed and filled using untreated wood bark chips, and compost as the active microbial agent that breaks down volatile organic compounds.",1431,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,,,,,,"compost,zero waste",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Aaron Wiebe,1431,Research Assistant, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9282/1430_Wiebe_0632.pdf,,,
Composting and Organics Collection: Is it Happening On Your Campus?,"University and college campuses across the nation are increasingly adding food scraps collection and, often, the operation of compost or anaerobic digestion facilities to their 'green' portfolio to achieve STARS points or campus sustainability and zero waste goals. While every campus is unique, learning from the experiences and sharing of the trials and tribulations of other institutions can help jumpstart new programs and improve those in place. We want to bring together a facilitated discussion led by the University of Arizona Compost Cats--who are experienced in running their campus facility for both campus and regional use, are Rathmann Big Idea Challenge grant recipients, and leaders in the youth and college sector of the US Composting Council. They will be joined in facilitation by the USCC, the only US organization whose mission is leadership of the compost industry nationwide.",8316,4465,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,,,,,,compost,10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Linda Norris-Waldt,8316,Communications Director,Chester Phillips,4465,Senior Sustainability Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Building on Your Institutional Strengths to Reduce Food Waste,"Unity College had a small scale limited food waste collection system in the dining halls on campus. By working with a local partner, the food waste that could be collected expanded and is now sent to an anaerobic processing facility to be turned into energy. This not only greatly increased the amount of food waste collected each day, but also led to a culture of waste reduction being created in Unity's Dining Services. Learn from Unity's experiences of growing an existing program, how that has spurred interest on campus in other food and waste issues, & learn how you can build on your own institutions current infrastructure and local resources.",769,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,,,,,,food waste,10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Jonathan Gibbons,769,Sustainability Staff, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Can You Dig It?: Integrating Vermicomposting at UC Berkeley,"Our project was initially inspired by the work in progress at the CSU - Sacramento Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center (STORC). They are implementing a new processing system for their campus' organic waste that integrates vermiculture and aquaponics called the Multitrophic Sustainability System (MTSS). The bottommost layer of this system is a tank of fish who feed on worms from the vermicompost above, which produces the upper layer of finished compost where plants are grown. For our own campus, our goal is to process all campus organic waste in-house with three different composting systems: the MTSS, a windrow system and organics sorting facility, and vermicompost. The MTSS offers research opportunities on multitrophic ecosystems, closed-loop systems, and alternative gardening. The windrow system will be the main method of processing the large amount of waste a university campus produces. While the MTSS and windrow system are both integral parts of our long term plan, our current focus is on the vermicompost system. The vermicompost bin will act as a small-scale pilot to model and test our plans to process all campus organic waste. The 5x24 foot bin we plan to purchase can handle an input of 155 - 250 pounds of food waste per day, or an output of 693 - 1,040 pounds per week. We are currently coordinating with campus dining services, waste management, and the grounds/facilities department on the redirection of the correct amount of food and yard waste to the vermicompost bin. It takes five to six months for the first compost to finish, so we will also have that time to organize compost donations to local and campus gardens, namely the garden of the residence hall where the bin will be placed.",4473,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,,,,,,"vermiculture,compost,food waste,closed loop",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Alejandra Marquez,4473,UC Berkeley,Courtney McGuire,4473,"Undergraduate Student, Project Supervisor",Valerie Yong,4473,"Associate, Student Environmental Resource Center", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Rebel Rot: An Engineering Capstone Project to Convert a Dumpster into an In-Vessel Composter,"Building off a past AASHE presentation (2017) by Dr. Brian Barnes from the University of Louisville, the University of Nevada Las Vegas Sustainability Coordinator partnered with the College of Engineering to have three students convert a six cubic yard dumpster into an automated in-vessel composter. Dr. Barnes program inspired the presenter to see how U of L's model could be implemented at UNLV. However, the number of volunteers used by U of L presented a barrier to UNLV. To overcome the obstacle, Pike sought a means to automate the repurposed dumpster and utilized the Campus as a Living Lab model to achieve the outcome. The in-vessel composter is used for paper towels, coffee grounds, some food waste, and special event organic waste. The repurposed dumpster compliments UNLV's recently acquired used commercial eight cubic yard rotating drum in-vessel composter. The two projects were initiated at the same time in hopes that one would be accepted and implemented. Luckily, both projects became a reality. Between the two units, UNLV is making beautiful Rebel Rot compost. We are once again providing zero waste event/meeting services to the campus, and we have opened up the possibility for a zero waste student union. We are hoping to research the scalability of these types of units to hotel-casinos on the Las Vegas Strip corridor. The presenters will share the details of the Rebel Rot Campus as a Living Lab Capstone Project as well as the details and story of the used in-vessel composter.",3649,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,Curriculum,,,,,"compost,capstone experience,living labs",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Tara Pike,3649,Sustainability Coordinator/Recycling Manager,Sabina Malik,3649,Grad Student/ UNLV Community Garden Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10537/0830_Malik_0124.pptx,,,

Building an Open Source Food Recovery Website: Pairing University Dining Halls With Shelters,"About one-third of food is wasted globally each year (Smith). Further, 30-40% of all food in the U.S. goes uneaten each year, resulting in 133 billion pounds of waste, worth $1 trillion USD (USDA, Smith). Also wasted is energy, labor, land use, and water involved in food production, resulting in 3.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (Smith). Close to 15% of American households struggle with food insecurity (USDA). The problems of food waste can be reduced by addressing several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Zero Hunger, Good Health and Well-being, Sustainable Cities and Communities, Responsible Consumption and Production, and Climate Action. With these goals in mind, we are implementing a human-centered design approach over three academic quarters in a directed research group comprised of interdisciplinary BS and MS students, where we are building an open source, interactive responsive food recovery website for pairing leftover university dining hall food with non-profit agencies in need. The goal of this website is to decrease the amount of food currently being composted while feeding people in need, and facilitating community involvement and mindfulness surrounding the topic of sustainability. Utilizing volunteer student delivery groups, the website will aid logistics in coordinating food deliveries between dining halls and shelters. In the future, an open source platform like ours could be adopted by higher education institutions.",4030,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,Public Engagement,,,,,"food waste,food recovery,websites",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Meghna Shrimanth Bhairappa,4030,Graduate Student, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7965/1400_Spyridakis_0382.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7958/1400_Bhairappa_0382_1020_011721.pdf,,
Integrated Plastics Recycling and Research Facility at UC Berkeley,"The Zero Waste Research Center at UC Berkeley is working to create the first Plastics Recycling Facility at UC Berkeley. This facility, located at the Global Bay Campus in Richmond, will process the University's plastic and recycling waste through proper collection, sorting, and redistribution. This project will allow for the University of California, Berkeley to expand recycling and reuse programs, reduce its carbon footprint, and create research and education opportunities for its students and the community of Richmond. We are working to incorporate 3-D printing into the project by reprocessing our plastic waste into 3-D printing filament. This project will be one of the first of its kind, and will greatly improve recycling efforts on university-wide and local levels. We will present visual examples of the materials recovery process, and will have hand on activities and discussions on waste management operations within other universities attending the workshop for the latter half of the presentation. This presentation will result in campus-specific upstream and downstream solutions to plastic waste on campus. Also, we will showcase how to find specific solutions to providing a circular economy for common waste items by recording diversion rates and finding particular business partners to take plastic waste. We will present local, non-chemically intensive methods for processing plastic waste to be used in the creation of consumer end products that have worked for the UC Berkeley campus. We will identify partnering businesses on a local level who may be interested in taking this material, and processing it for them in the way they prefer in order to make the exchange as easy as possible.

Measuring Success - Auditing the Zero Waste Process,"At the Medical University of South Carolina we, like many campuses, are constantly improving our waste system in an effort to strive for 'Zero Waste'. During the 2016 RecycleMania competition we were given the opportunity to measure the effectiveness of our efforts. With the help of RubberMaid Commercial Products, we performed two consecutive waste audits with the third scheduled for March 2018. These audits provided insight into exactly what was going into our waste system and allowed us to measure the impact of improvements (installing backboards, grouping bins in stations, etc.), and allowed us to see opportunities in the waste stream such as food waste. We chose the first two floors of a mixed-use campus building as the area of study. The first audit assessed the effectiveness of our current waste system: 1) Recycling bins and trash cans spread throughout the floor-some together, some alone - After performing the audit and establishing a baseline for the two floors we improved the waste system. 2) Grouping recycling and trash bins in stations throughout the floors, equipped these bins with backboards displaying what can and cannot be placed in them. 3) Started distributing annual recycling guides campus-wide on America Recycles Day - We saw major improvements from these changes in our 2017 waste audit as well as some issues and opportunities. Our third round of improvements included: Implemented front-of-house composting; Redistributed annual recycling guide; Performed door-to-door education for composting. We are very interested in the results of our March Waste Audit. In our presentation we will give data from these three waste audits and will talk about the process, findings, and some challenges and tips for measuring the zero waste process.",3315,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"zero waste,waste audits",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,John Brooker,3315,Sustainability Communications Specialist,Christine von Kolnitz,3315,Sustainability Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9225/1430_Brooker_0560.pdf,,,

Trash Talking: South Dakota State University's Effort to Increase Campus' Recycling Rate,"Like most universities, it is not unusual to find trash and recycling in the wrong bin at South Dakota State University. Sparked by SDSU's STARS 2016 report, the campus Sustainability Specialist is currently on a journey to increase campus' recycling rate. In addition to the STARS report, previous waste audits concluded that SDSU has the potential to greatly increase the recycling quantity. After identifying campus' recycling rate could increase, the Sustainability Specialist conducted a simple survey. The survey asked students, faculty, and staff what they found confusing about recycling, what would motivate them to recycle, and how recycling information should be shared with campus. After analyzing the results, the Sustainability Specialist has been delivering the proposed plan to campus. This plan includes presenting to departments and student clubs about what can be recycled and distributing a simple, yet informative recycling guide. In addition, the poster will include education efforts that went alongside new recycling bins added to campus during spring 2018 and fall 2018. This poster will be a reflective overview of identifying the past barriers to recycling, implementing a responsive education campaign as well as the effort's successes and lessons learned.

"Urban, Rural, and On-Campus Solutions (UROC): Living Campus Accelerator Toolkit","Arizona State University has committed to becoming carbon neutral for campus buildings by 2025. University Sustainability Practices (USP) is working tirelessly to help fulfill this vision. USP and partner universities from Mexico City, Dublin, London, Hong Kong, and Lüneburg in the Global Consortium for Sustainability Outcomes (GCSO) are tackling CO2 emissions reduction by reducing 'unnecessary' hot water on campuses as a pilot climate solution to scale globally. By engaging students, staff, and faculty, USP is redefining how hot water is perceived. This initiative is helping to address Sustainable Development Goals #9 and #11: industry, innovation and infrastructure; sustainable cities and communities. Reducing 'unnecessary' hot water encourages utilizing existing infrastructure to be more sustainable, making ASU more resilient. As recognized by health professionals, hot water is not as effective as cold water for sanitation in hand washing. By eliminating the energy used to heat such water, carbon emissions are significantly reduced. Facilities management took the lead in monitoring energy use in four pilot buildings on the Tempe campus. For two months, hot water was eliminated from the restrooms in these buildings to measure potential energy costs savings for ASU and to gauge social and behavioral impacts. Currently, the extrapolated energy savings are estimated to be 2% of the total Tempe campus energy use!

On-Campus Water Reclamation: A Tale of Two Cities,"Think globally. Act locally. Water is a critical issue in many parts of the world. See how Emory University and Arizona State University have turned to on-campus water reclamation as a way to address water sustainability and resilience. The WaterHub at Emory is an on-site water recycling system using engineered processes that emulate natural ecological systems to reclaim wastewater for heating and cooling buildings and toilet flushing. Resembling a greenhouse, the WaterHub is a living laboratory for research and teaching and for showcasing the capacity of operations to play a major role in water conservation. The first system of its kind in the US, it has the capacity to supply nearly 40% of Emory's total campus water needs. The facility relieves an over-burdened municipal system, saves Emory money over time, and reduces the use of potable water by over 400,000 gallons per day. Through the WaterHub docent program Emory students are trained to lead public tours for groups from around the world. The WaterHub at Emory served as an inspiration to Arizona State University to investigate a similar game-changing solution to its water goals. ASU is located in the desert southwest where nationally-recognized state groundwater law and municipal water management have ensured supply and kept water rates low for a generation. But a persistent drought calls for new solutions. ASU has studied the feasibility of 'WaterWorks', a reclamation project that could reduce ASU's potable water demand by over 35% at its largest campus while supporting cutting-edge research. With water rates less than half those in Atlanta and with a sophisticated, layered regional reclamation network already in place, the situation has quickly become very complex and the solutions potentially even more layered and complex. Two very different universities experiences can help inform what factors to consider and what solutions might work for your campus water goals.",4531,3931,2298,,,,,Water,Coordination & Planning,Curriculum,,,,,"water reclamation,water reduction",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Mick Dalrymple,4531,"Director, University Sustainability Practices",Ciannat Howett,3931,Director of Sustainability,Bob Salvatelli,2298,Director of Sales, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/10298/0915_Salvatelli_0953.pdf,,,
Harvesting Hope for the Future Through Green Infrastructure,"Tucson is situated in one of the most arid regions of the world. Consequently, conserving water for the use of both people and the environment is of utmost importance. Doing so in a way that accentuates the natural aesthetic beauty of the Sonoran Desert, while also providing a functional, sustainable solution to rain water mitigation, water conservation, and urban heat island effects is the ultimate goal. The University of Arizona is at the forefront of green infrastructure. One area on campus in particular that excels in making use of water is the UA Community Garden. Located there, are three significant infrastructure installations. A 28,000 gallon active harvesting cistern that collects rain from the Highland Garage for use in the garden, a series of runoff basins for the occasions when the active cistern overflows, and the newly constructed pollinator garden passive basin that diverts rain from the bike path and encourages percolation into the aquifer. The combination of these three projects have allowed a previously barren lot to become transformed into a lush garden oasis.

In this presentation, Dr. Zeman will discuss the etiology of disruption to the global nitrogen cycle, health concerns and complexities associated with the nitrogen cycle, and clarify some misunderstandings that may exist about exogenous and endogenous nitrogen and its role for human health and wellbeing. For example, perhaps you have heard that too much nitrogen is not good for human health yet see advertisements for supplements containing concentrated beet extracts to boost nitrate levels in the body. Further, what is the latest research on cancers, birth defects, and immunological issues related to nitrate exposures from food and water? What should a person believe? Is there cause for alarm? This presentation will help sort through these important issues. Dr. Zeman will also discuss the policy associated implications of drinking water nitrate regulation and help attendees to understand how to access their localities drinking water information or figure out how to have their private well tested.",3690,,,,,,,Water,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,,"nitrogen,water quality",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Catherine Zeman,3690,Professor and Director, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8975/1430_Zeman_0264.pdf,,,
Redefining Sustainable Campuses and Development Through the Lens of Health and Wellness,"Our understanding of how the built environment impacts health and wellness has increased significantly in recent years; however, the human and social elements of sustainability are frequently given less attention than they deserve. Now, new development frameworks focused on health and wellness for shapers of the built environment have been brought to market that are providing an opportunity for focused improvements of how we develop, build, and operate healthy buildings, campuses, districts, and beyond. This presentation will focus primarily on health and wellness optimizations that can be made at the campus construction and operational level to bring sustainability to new levels, but there will be links for how various items enable the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, this session will touch on the following SDGs: Good Health and Well-being; Clean Water and Sanitation; Affordable and Clean Energy; Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure; Reduced Inequalities; Sustainable Cities and Communities; Responsible Consumption and Production; and Climate Action. The presenters will provide material from four rating systems - the WELL Building Standard, Fitwel, EcoDistricts, and the Living Community Challenge - and drill into how many of their elements can enable developers, owners, and practitioners in the built environment to work towards the targets and indicators of the previously identified UN SDG's. Lastly, the seminar will conclude with a look at some of the research documenting the impact of the built environment on health and wellness, and outline opportunities for expanded research activities in this area.",6798,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Buildings,,,,,,"building occupants,wellness",10/3/2018,AASHE,Poster,Steven Burke,6798,"Consigli Construction Company, Inc.", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8885/1430_Burke_0146.pdf,,,
Adaptation and Resilience in Sustaining Ourselves - A Micro-Retreat,"Join sustainability professionals across Minnesota in discovering how a model of stepping away from our various institutions, discovering common challenges and building cross-institution relationships helps us sustain ourselves. The planning team from the fifth annual Sustaining Ourselves Retreat will share a model for a retreat away from campus life that renews us for the work we do in sustainability. During this session, we will provide an overview of the retreat model and include two 20-minute activity sessions of connecting with each other and reflecting on preparing students and our campus community to rise to global challenges. The flexible framework that has been developed across our institutions and varied level of experience in the field includes both structured and unstructured conversations on topics of sharing our own narratives, reflecting on common values, avoiding burn-out and connecting on innovative approaches to sustainability challenges. This year's theme is around resiliency and adaptation: Adapting to changes in our lives, to changes in our work, to changes in leadership, to global changes and adapting ourselves to be present. As individuals working on complex local and global challenges, participants will identify areas for discussion prior to the conference and have opportunities to share suggestions and ideas from colleagues.",32,4603,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,"sustainability officers,self care",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Mary Hannemann,32,Sustainability Education Project Coordinator,Suzanne Savanick Hansen,4603,Sustainability Manager, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8053/0915_Hannemann_0466.pdf,,,
Resilience and Renewal - A Retreat Model: Preparing Ourselves for a Lifetime of Global Change,"Join sustainability students in discovering how a model of stepping away from our various institutions, discovering common challenges, and reflecting on our resilience can help us sustain ourselves. Central College and the University of Minnesota five-campus system have student leadership retreats designed to support and renew sustainability leaders, build relationships between students, and strengthen the capacity of student organizations to thrive through challenges and transitions. This workshop will provide tools and planning resources to design a similar student retreat that participants can lead on their own campuses. We will include two 20-minute activities to introduce experiences that could be part of such a retreat. One will allow students to practice engaging with the place through movement and reflection, in this case the connecting with the water and steel of the riverfront convention center. Another will introduce mindfulness practices that can be integrated into such a retreat, including silence, meditation, and creative art-making. Both activities will include time for individual and shared reflection. The workshop will invite participants to connect with each other and reflect on the theme of personal resilience as sustainability leaders. How can we prepare for changes in our lives, changes in our work, changes in leadership, and changes in our institutions? How can we be adaptive in the face of global challenges like those in the UN Sustainable Development Goals?",4371,32,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"student leadership,social change",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Brian Campbell,4371,Director of Sustainability Education,Mary Hannemann,32,Sustainability Education Project Coordinator,Jessica Foor,32,Graphic Designer,Sai Powar,32,Student,Elizabeth Sheldon,4371,Student Sustainability Coordinator,Tristan Murphy,4371,Student, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8582/1300_Hannemann_0970.pdf,,,

Innovation: Creating a new Minor in Somatic Sustainability at Appalachian State University,"Awakening somatic intelligence and understanding sustainable body practices are important aspects of an enlarged conversation of sustainability. As a part of that dialogue, we have created a new minor in Somatic Sustainability at Appalachian State University focusing on the cultivation of body awareness and mindfulness through somatic practice in relation to current principles of sustainability. When considering our whole being, any situation that affects our physical body reverberates in our cognitive, emotional, and spiritual being, as well. Contextualizing somatic practices within the three more commonly understood elements, or 'legs' of sustainability- economics, the environment and social justice from an energetic body perspective are critical and timely. The minor offers an introductory foundation of possibilities for relational ways of thinking and understanding our embodied actions as they impact our sustainability. Somatics, as an emerging field within academia, offers an additional lens for transformation to start from within one's self. Placing somatic work as relational to sustainable practice is claiming the importance of kinesthetic learning and self awareness as a vehicle for growth and change. Bridging a foundational range of somatic practices such as Yoga, Pilates and Gyrokinesis with course work in Sustainable Development has allowed an embodied perspective of sustainability in academia to emerge.",4398,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,"somatics,wellness",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Laurie Atkins,4398,"Associate Professor, Dance Studies",Marianne Adams,4398,"Professor, Dance Studies", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/7971/1400_Atkins_0389.pdf,,,
This Justice In: Updated Results From the Living Wage Policy Study,"This session will provide the most recent results from the Living Wage Policy Study, a five-year multi-phase research project exploring the prevalence and nature and living wage policies in American higher education. This project uses a rubric based on the Model Just Employment Policy, which was prepared by the Harrison Institute for Public Law and the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor at Georgetown University. The Living Wage Policy Study examines institutional performance metrics to assess the potential effects of living wage policies, including operating margins, bond ratings, institutional rankings/reputation, and media coverage, among others. Wherever possible, the study also explore show living wage policies came into existence. The most comprehensive living wage policies cover both the institution's direct employees and its contractors' employees. Given the ubiquitous outsourcing across higher education, a policy requiring that contractors' employees be paid a living wage may be a much larger financial commitment than a policy covering only to direct employees. A living wage policy that excludes contractors inevitably raises questions of justice, fairness, and respect for everyone working on a campus. Thus, instead of enacting a living wage policy, a number of institutions engage in unpublished living wage practices, ensuring that direct employees are paid a living wage, but not treating contractors' employees similarly.",674,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Coordination & Planning,,,,,,"living wage,employee compensation,policies",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Ken Weidner,674,Assistant Professor of Management, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8298/1130_Weidner_0676.pdf,,,
"Well-Being for All, Sustainably at Dawson College","Institutes of higher education may be populated with many people, but they can be lonely places for staff and students alike. Stress is also prevalent in our schools. An ever-increasing body of evidence demonstrates that contact with nature develops well-being and can also be an important part of transforming education. Connecting with nature is associated with positive emotions and recognized as a significant restorative agent. In fact, it has been demonstrated that Nature's beneficial effects go beyond mere restoration by positively enhancing true mental health and well-being and can help mitigate stress. In 2016, Dawson College adopted its third-generation Strategic Plan, highlighting ""well-being for all, sustainably"" as a core value. There are many aspects of well-being and a variety of definitions exist in academic and policy literature. Seligman identifies well-being theory as having five major elements: positive emotion, engagement, positive relationships, meaning and accomplishments. In addition, wellness as an extension of health is also defined as connected to the health of the natural environment, spiritual wellness and physical wellness. This workshop will showcase the many initiatives Dawson College has taken to ensure well-being for its employees and how these initiatives, such as our Monarch Butterfly Program, Peace Garden, rooftop gardening and participation in a Sustainable Happiness Certificate program, are impacting employee satisfaction and engagement.",4714,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"nature,wellness",10/3/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Chris Adam,4714,Director - Sustainability Office,Katherine McWhaw,4714,"Coordinator, Quality Assurance & Planning Office", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8001/1045_McWhaw_0415.pptx,,,

Sustaining our Communities Through Care and Action,"Sustainability is becoming more expansive; ideas about social and economic justice and human health are becoming integrated into the environmental field. But is this holistic ideal replicated in the way we do our work? Our institutions are full of passionate people eager to take on challenges, yet many of us are feeling burned out and frustrated. Why is this? Are we reproducing the very injustices we are working against in the structure of our movements? This workshop will serve as a starting point to think about how community care principles can be incorporated into our organizations to better address complex issues. To have transformative change in our world we need to treat each other, our environment, and ourselves with respect and care. We must build institutions that embrace justice as a guiding principle and act accordingly. To accomplish this requires intentional work within our communities including recognizing and acting against structural injustices, sharing skills, knowledge, and workload, and empowering marginalized groups. We must also care for and support each person in our networks by reducing hierarchies and egos and advocating for each other. Everyone must examine their own power and privilege and commit to continual and lifelong self-education and active work. Acting on the deeply felt care that we have for each other is at the core of building strong, equitable, sustainable, and thoughtful communities.",1876,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Campus Engagement,,,,,,self care,10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Kate Rayner Fried,1876,Sustainable Action Fund Education Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8086/1530_RaynerFried_0510.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/8086/1530_RaynerFried_0510.pdf,,
Stretching Your Sustainability Leadership Career: Future Business/Facilities Officer,"Many sustainability directors possess the requisite skills to position themselves for future leadership at a campus. Additionally, that stretch in their career path to more senior leadership positions could significantly advance campus sustainability goals. Hear how sustainability proficiencies in consensus building, negotiations, project management, bidding, strategic planning, attention to detail, multi-tasking, collaboration with diverse groups, and other stakeholder initiatives can provide a foundation for a future career path. With background information from both major national organizations, the presentation will discuss the changing role of both business and facilities officers that reflects many of the abilities, skills and talents that sustainability staff have accomplished. Suggestions on how to network, develop mentor or coaching conversations, seek skill diversification, and build beneficial relationships that might forge a different pathway to other leadership positions. It is critical that all elements of sustainability be overlaid on campus leaders. Those that have served as sustainability staff can expand leadership's perspectives and enhance the campus operations and environment.

Benefits of Incorporating Well-Being and Diversity Into Sustainability Master Planning,"Black Hills State University (BHSU) located in Spearfish, SD recently contracted with Verdis Group to complete a Sustainability Master Plan with goals set for 2030. Along with including robust environmental goals, BHSU took a holistic approach by including wellbeing and diversity in their plan. While these types of goals are common in strategic planning and other efforts, BHSU found it imperative to include them in their sustainability planning to ensure a well-rounded approach. The vision for BHSU is that wellbeing will become a concept that is embraced at all levels of the university in order for all participants of the community to thrive in relation to themselves, to one another and to nature. A university culture that embraces wellbeing can be expected to see increased rates of student, staff and faculty recruitment and retention, more innovation, greater job satisfaction, fewer health-related absences and a greater sense of equity and inclusion on campus. Similarly, a sustainable society thrives between the boundaries of a just social foundation and a healthy environment. As BHSU works to create a more sustainable university, it is essential that it work to ensure that its community is diverse, inclusive and fair. In nature, the greater the amount of diversity in an ecosystem, the healthier and more productive it will be. Greater species diversity ensures greater sustainability for all life forms in ecosystems.",8491,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Diversity & Affordability,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"sustainability plans,wellness",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Kim Morrow,8491,Senior Associate, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1801/events/9911/0830_Morrow_0722.pdf,,,
Everett Community College Sustainability Volunteer Program Gets People Working,"Video proposal (20 minutes/10 Minute Q&A) Since 2009, The Everett Community College Sustainability Department has teamed with several local agencies to fund a paid 'volunteer' program on campus. Volunteers from more than 35 countries and more than 50 Nationalities have participated in this work experience program which helps people immigrating to the United States find gainful, full time employment. Since its inception, nearly 75% of the participants who complete the program find full time work in 6 months or less. The program also provides a valuable service to the campus, by ensuring that single stream recycling is available to every EvCC site, while saving the college a combined 120,000 annually in staffing and service costs. All the while, keeping tons of campus recyclables out of landfills. The video will include a couple from Nepal, who are currently working in the program at the college; a participant who completed the program and was hired full time by the college; and a participant who completed the program and was hired elsewhere in the community. Members of the college departments impacted by or working with the volunteer program will also be included, as well as program coordinators from Refugee and Immigrant Services of Snohomish County, who help get funding for volunteer participants.",4087,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Waste,,,,,,"workforce development,refugees,recycling,immigration",10/4/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Molly Beeman,4087,Sustainability an Capital Projects Coordinator, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
Shaping Perceptions: Creative Explorations of Personal & Community Resiliency Through Art & Movement,"Life is stressful, and perception can hamper our ability to tackle our seemingly endless to-do lists. This workshop aims to equip participants with mechanisms to increase tolerance and productivity and enhance overall well-being by investigating perception through creative means, guided by decades of experience as artists and educators. This interactive and engaging workshop is based on the premise that re-framing and reassessing our patterned impressions of the world shifts paradigms and opens doors. We invite participants to explore their curiosities and challenge their assumptions through three complementary segments: 1.) touch-based drawing exercises, 2.) whole body movement, and 3.) sensory integration, strengthening the mind-body connection and broadening perceptions and environmental awareness in the process. The drawing exercises will encourage participants to actively investigate textures and shapes of unknown objects using only their sense of touch. Working individually and as teams, participants will learn techniques to navigate through life's unknowns and ambiguities by activating the sense of touch and delaying the ability to immediately label a variety of objects. These exercises will challenge the stockpile of fixed mental images and assumptions of the surrounding world by fostering a creative dialogue between the labeling mind and bodily senses. During Parts 2 and 3, participants will learn to harness the power of movement and stillness.",5047,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,,,,,,,"arts & culture,wellness",10/2/2018,AASHE,Presentation,Ashley Lynn Lavender,5047,Student Programs Coordinator and Faculty,Steve Johnson,5047,"Department of Studio Art, College of Charleston", ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,, ,,,,,,
