Environmental Service Fee,"Texas State University - In 2000, Texas State University's student chapter of the National Association of Environmental Professional (NAEP), sponsored by the department of Geography, conceived the Environmental Service Fee. The President of the student organization worked with two Associated Student Government (ASG) senators and introduced state legislation enacting a student fee that applies to environmental projects and education on campus. These student leaders originally drafted a broad bill that defined the idea of a campus environmental fee which was passed by the ASG. NAEP members administered a poll in fall 2000 to see what the campus interest would be and received tremendous support. The bill was approved by President's Cabinet and the Texas State University System Board of Regents. In 2003, during the 78th Legislative Session, the Texas Legislature approved the bill and it was signed into law by Governor Rick Perry. In March 2004 it was presented to the student body for a vote and was approved by an overwhelming 82.9 percent. The fee generates $73,000 annually. The funds are administered by the Environmental Service Fee Committee, comprised of 7 students, 3 faculty members, and staff from Housing and Residence Life, Facilities, and Finance and Support Services. The fee may be increased by the Board of Regents and by a majority vote during a student government election. Projects approved by the Committee include: a vermicomposting program, installing duel flush toilets in an older administrative building, Bobcat Blend (winner of the Texas Environmental Excellence Award, a program of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality), rain water collection systems for the departments of biology and agriculture, development of the Sustainable Farm, installation of water hydration stations in the residence halls and other campus buildings, installation of a Food 4 Thought Organic Garden, and many other projects.","Texas State University, San Marcos",8001,Investment & Finance,"green funds,student fees",1/1/2004,Student Fees,No,$4,,,,,,http://www.txstate.edu/esc/,Environmental Service Committee Webpage,,

The Green Initiative Fund,"The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) is UC Berkeley’s Campus Green Fund. TGIF provides funding, via grants, for projects that improve and support UC Berkeley’s campus sustainability efforts. TGIF allocates funds to projects that promote sustainable modes of transportation, increase energy and water efficiency, restore habitat, promote environmental and food justice, and reduce the amount of waste created by UC Berkeley. Portions of the fund also support education & behavior change initiatives, student financial aid (via return to aid), and student internships. Students, faculty, and staff may submit project proposals, which are selected for funding by the annually-appointed TGIF Committee, consisting of students, faculty, and staff, on which the students have the majority vote.
TGIF is administered by the TGIF Committee and the TGIF Coordinator. The Committee’s voting members include one student representative each from the ASUC, Graduate Assembly, and 2 application-based at-large representatives, in addition to a representative each from Capital Strategies, Administration, and Faculty. Non-voting members include a representative from the Committee on Student Fees, ex-officios from the Office of Sustainability, Energy Office, and the SERC Director. TGIF received final approval by the Chancellor and UC Regents during the summer of 2007. Student leaders created a massive and successful campus campaign, and the fee referendum was approved by the student body during the April 2007 elections of the Associated Students of the University of California, then renewed in 2016 by a renewal campaign and referendum. The current amount of student fees collected is $8/student/semester, and when students voted to renew TGIF in 2016, they voted to approve a fee step increase throughout 2027. So the fee will remain at $8 2017-2020; will increase to $9 from 2020 through 2023; and will increase again to $10 from 2023-2027.

Revolving Energy Efficiency Fund (EEF),"Launched in 2009 with a $650,000 grant from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), UNH’s Energy Efficiency Fund (EEF) has already seen more than $500,000 in energy savings “returns,” including over $250,000 in FY12 alone. The UNH Energy Task Force (ETF) estimates that after a decade, the university will realize about $3 million in energy savings and prevent more than 8,500 metric tonnes of greenhouse gases from being emitted -- the equivalent of over 1,600 passenger vehicles or 19,000 barrels of oil. 
The EEF is a “revolving” fund. Savings from the energy efficiency projects are estimated using a combination of sub metering and engineering estimates that follow the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol. Savings are captured through a System’s Benefit Charge (SBC) included in the utility costs charged to campus units. Thus a slightly higher rate offsets lower consumption due to the energy efficiency improvements and the net impact of funding the EEF on campus units is cost neutral. Gas and electric utility companies recover similar costs from their customers using similar system benefit rate structures. The UNH Energy Office targets an average five-year payback on projects funded. Project selections are approved by the UNH Energy Task Force, which is comprised of administrators, faculty, staff and students from across campus. $1,325,000 was set aside to start the fund.",University of New Hampshire,0724,Investment & Finance,"green funds,revolving funds",1/1/2009,,Yes,,,,,,,https://sustainableunh.unh.edu/revolvingfund,Program Webpage,,

WMU Green Revolving Fund,"Western Michigan University has designed an innovative “Quasi-Revolving Fund” model that demonstrates the institution’s full commitment to incorporating sustainability into campus operations. The Quasi-Revolving Fund recaptures money from cost-savings, similar to a typical green revolving fund, but it also sources capital from the broader utilities, maintenance, and other budgets as necessary in a fluid manner. Therefore, its ability to finance projects is often far more substantial than the fixed pool of capital that comprises most revolving funds. As a result, it does not have a formal and consistent fund size; project finance opportunities are constantly tracked and reviewed as modifications to the overall utilities and maintenance budgets are made. This process allows for the institution to continuously invest in sustainability initiatives that promise a high rate of return without being limited by a lack of capital in the fund itself. The university reports that this combined strategy for funding sustainability improvements through a Quasi-Revolving Fund has achieved a 47 percent return on investment since its establishment in 1980. $1,000,000 was set aside to start the fund.",Western Michigan University,1817,Investment & Finance,"green funds,revolving funds",1/1/2011,,Yes,,,,,,,http://greenbillion.org/case-study/western-michigan-university-quasi-revolving-fund/,Quasi-Revolving Fund Case Study,,
