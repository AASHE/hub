A Journey to Real Food: Growing an Intersectional Food Movement through Student Involvement and Empowerment,"Empowered communities yield brilliant minds. Empowered, well fed communities allow for meaningful growth in all areas. The intersectional nature of sustainable food, thought, and community driven enterprises brought the Real Food Challenge (RFC) to life. Both Fort Lewis College and Gonzaga University have found that exploring the nuances of intersectionality and inspiring student involvement are integral in the success of the RFC. This presentation will discuss how the shift towards 'real' food impacts the sustainability of a school and plays a part in recognition of diverse groups, classist structures, and the ability to foster connections within a broader community. Participants should expect to explore the privilege and responsibility in revolutionizing a food system and why it is more effective to empower students rather engage them. We will share best practices for implementation, struggles we have faced in reaching procurement goals, and a unique initiative to address community wide involvement in the RFC. This workshop aims to spread food democracy and sustainability while fostering a greater sense of purpose in how the RFC interacts with campuses, community members, and the food industry.",Gonzaga University,2258,Gonzaga University,2258,Fort Lewis College,1822,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,,,,"real food,intersectionality",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Laura Marck,Student,Gonzaga University,2258,Kathryn Graham,,Gonzaga University,2258,Angela Rae,Undergraduate Student,Gonzaga University,2258,Elizabeth Terry,student,Gonzaga University,2258,Kaidee Akullo,Environmental Center Student Staff,Fort Lewis College,1822,Rachel Landis,Environmental Center Coordinator,Fort Lewis College,1822,Aolani Peiper,Real food challenge team coordinator,Fort Lewis College,1822,Katrina Rachwitz,,Fort Lewis College,1822,0915_Akullo.pdf,,,
Organizing for Sustainability: How Student Sustainability Groups Make a Difference,"From clubs to official classes, internships to independent volunteering, students are often the primary drivers of campus sustainability efforts. Yet student organizations can also face real challenges, including group continuity and recruiting, reluctant or indifferent administrators, finding funding and willing collaborators, and building effective organizations. It's hard for any group to keep working toward sustainability if it's constantly struggling to sustain itself. This panel will feature students and sustainability staff from 5 universities discussing best practices for successful, sustained student engagement as well as what challenges have been most daunting and how they might be overcome. While we might not have all the answers, we'll discuss what has worked and what hasn't where we are, and we'll compare our answers to the most pressing questions. What is the right balance for student organizations between collaboration and protest? What is the proper role for sustainability staff in working with student organizations? How do we truly institutionalize long term student engagement in sustainability work on our campuses? How should we measure success? This will be a shared learning session, with very short presentations from each institution followed by abundant time for questions from and discussion with the audience.",University of Arizona,4465,University of Northern Iowa,3690,Trinity University,2593,Northern Arizona University,0567,The Ohio State University,2335,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,student organizations,10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Chester Phillips,Senior Sustainability Coordinator/ Compost Cats Project Director,University of Arizona,4465,Alanna Gerardi,,University of Arizona,4465,Michaela Webb,Farm Manager,University of Arizona,4465,Eric O'Brien,Sustainability Coordinator,University of Northern Iowa,3690,Gabriella Ruggiero,,University of Northern Iowa,3690,Kristen Rundstein,,Trinity University,2593,Sarah Holditch,Student Leader,Northern Arizona University,0567,Thomas Reeves,Director--Energy Management & Sustainability,The Ohio State University,2335,,,,
Food Service Companies and Campuses Innovating to Source More Local Food,"This session will focus on increasing local food purchasing through stakeholder engagement at universities in Arizona, Maine, Michigan and Vermont. GVSU continues to expand its sustainable agriculture educational opportunities and also provides Aramark with local, organic produce for use at its Certified Green Restaurant. This meets Aramark goals while supporting the GVSU Strategic Plan. This collaboration also allows for more Farm to Table dining options and innovative, sustainable menus for students, faculty, and staff. In Vermont and Maine, Sodexo launched statewide initiatives to increase local food purchasing in the institutional market that have forged new approaches to address enduring challenges in the farm to institution landscape, from effective collaboration to accurately measuring change. Attendees will learn how Sodexo's Vermont First and Maine Course initiatives have assembled statewide stakeholder groups and about Sodexo's best practices in local tracking and creative collaborations. At a large university like Arizona State University, there is a unique and diverse customer base that relies on Aramark food service's campus dining for most or all of their meals. Thus, businesses are eager to get their company featured in campus dining locations. Join us in learning how campus dining services can forge connections between local companies and university students and faculty through local procurement and sourcing from ASU's Campus Harvest program.",Grand Valley State University,2426,Aramark Higher Education,3691,Sodexo,3600,University of Vermont,3995,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,,local foods,10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Yumiko Jakobcic,Campus Sustainability Coordinator,Grand Valley State University,2426,Colin Yonkers,Food Service Director,Aramark Higher Education,3691,Annie Rowell,Vermont First Coordinator,Sodexo,3600,Maeve McInnis,Maine Course Director,Sodexo,3600,Caylin McKee,,University of Vermont,3995,Krista Hicks,Sustainability Manager,Aramark Higher Education,3691,Austin Johnson,Sustainability Coordinator,Aramark Higher Education,3691,,,,,,,,
"Rookies, Newbies, Imposters, & Not-Yet-Experts: Navigating Newness, Isolation, and/or Competence for Sustainability Professionals in Higher Education","Panelists and audience members will share perspectives, experiences, and advice as they discuss challenges and support strategies at the intersections of newness, isolation, and competence for sustainability professionals in higher education. This panel is meant to serve a broad audience: Rookie sustainability officers or people who are relatively new sustainability professionals in higher education; (Mildly) experienced sustainability officers who are relatively new to coordinating sustainability at their current institutions; Sustainability officers at institutions where coordinating sustainability is a relatively new or unknown effort; Sustainability officers who are not new, but nonetheless feel somewhat stuck, lost, or uncertain in their roles; Sustainability officers who are the lone sustainability staff at their institutions, or who otherwise experience feelings of isolation in their roles; Sustainability officers who sometimes feel like imposters among their sustainability peers and stakeholders; People who manage someone(s) who might fall into one or more of the categories above. The panel will consist of six sustainability officers representing varying perspectives, institution types, and degrees of experience/expertise in relation to this topic.

Sustainability in Residential Life,"Looking to build campus connections? Consider working with your institution's Residence Life Department! This session will highlight four different case studies of engagement with Residence Life, a department that touches almost all students on campus. Concordia College will provide an overview of how Residence Life Departments often look, why you should consider partnering together, how you can take some of those first steps, and how to trouble shoot some problems you may run into NYU will provide an overview of their residence halls energy-savings competition. It will also cover challenges and new creative ways to promote engagement through the use of social media. The Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology will showcase their HERE program, a living-learning experience for first-year students who want to learn about sustainability in engineering and science. As they live together in one residence hall, students take a series of sustainability-focused courses, which culminates in a spring-quarter design project to improve the campus. Northern Arizona University will share the student perspective on the challenges and rewards of being an Eco-Rep, who provide peer education on sustainable living habits in their assigned residence hall and around campus.",New York University,2138,Concordia College,2930,Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology,3135,Northern Arizona University,0567,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Buildings,,,Housing & Residence Life,residence halls,10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Dianne Anderson,Director of Sustainability,New York University,2138,Aryn Aiken,,New York University,2138,Kylie Windecker,Hall Director,Concordia College,2930,Mark Minster,Associate Professor of English and Comp Lit,Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology,3135,Jennifer Mueller Price,Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering,Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology,3135,Kasey Kallevig,Eco Rep,Northern Arizona University,0567,,,,,,,,,1445_Kallevig.pdf,1445_Windecker.pdf,,
Engaging Tech-Savvy Students in Curricular and Co-Curricular Sustainability Programs for Social and Environmental Change,"Sustainability education can meaningfully build and enhance relationships with diverse stakeholders while engaging students in learning that promotes social and environmental change. Leaders from Georgia Tech will share their experiences linking technological learning with campus and community projects. We will discuss the sustainability landscape at Georgia Tech and the unique challenges of engaging technically-minded students and faculty. We will present the challenges and successes of our new campus wide academic initiative, Serve-Learn-Sustain, related to building a coalition of faculty, staff, and students across campus to integrate themes of sustainable communities into classroom learning. We will discuss engaging students in the classroom through community engagement and service-learning, as well as the connection to co-curricular programs allowing students to use their technical skills. We will focus on several case studies, including Georgia Tech's Greenovation competition and 'Turn Down for Watt' project (students engineering their own hardware and software to create a dorm energy competition), as well as a partner collaboration with Mechanical Engineering faculty and students on a Capstone project to build the Advanced Atmospheric Research and Monitoring Station, focused on sustainability and reducing health disparities through air pollution.

Brave Together: Learning What We Don't Know About Diversity,The US current political climate is one of division and conflict. With the protests in Charlottesville and Boston the opportunity has presented itself to face injustice head on. College campuses have a unique opportunity to spend time creating dialogue around these issues to help people learn and take action. We will hear from 5 campuses who are rising to the occasion and work through an exercise on active listening that you can do on your campus.,Bentley University,0854,Princeton University,2597,University of Missouri,3593,University of Virginia,4028,Chemeketa Community College,6281,University of Michigan,1744,,,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,"active listening,discrimination response",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Natalie Berland,Manager of Sustainability,Bentley University,0854,Caroline Savage,Campus as a Living Lab Manager,Princeton University,2597,Srinivasan (Raghu) Raghavan,Sustainability Manager,University of Missouri,3593,Nina Morris,Outreach & Engagement Program Manager,University of Virginia,4028,Stephania Fregosi,Sustainability Coordinator,Chemeketa Community College,6281,John Callewaert,"Emerging Opportunities Director, Graham Sustainability Institute",University of Michigan,1744,,,,,,,,,1130_Savage_3005.pptx,1130_Callewaert_3005.pdf,,
Next Generation Campus Green Funds,"Through the use of green funds, colleges and universities have the ability to empower students who are passionate about bringing clean energy and sustainable projects to their campuses. This joint presentation will focus on the use of green funds at Appalachian State University, New York University, Mohawk College, and The Evergreen State College. Each institution has been successful in utilizing a student fee to sponsor campus sustainability projects. Appalachian State University's presentation on the Renewable Energy Initiative will address their strategies to expand the scope of their work. New York University's presentation will cover the Green Grants program and its success at institutionalizing sustainable change. Mohawk College will feature the Sustainability Initiatives Fund and its Idea Bank campaign, which engages students in bringing their sustainable project ideas to fruition. The Evergreen State College will speak about the creation of the Clean Energy Committee, which operates as both a fund for renewable energy credits to power the college, as well as a fund for student and staff sustainability research, education, and projects.

Strategic Alignment: Communicating Sustainability's Contributions and Value to Mission Level Priorities,"Given the challenges facing higher education, from ongoing budget cuts and an affordability crisis to new political realities, sustainability professionals must identify and make a case for the ways in which sustainability, carbon neutrality and resilience can help executive leadership overcome these barriers. For the last four years, the Big Ten and Friends Sustainability Group has been discussing how we might identify: 1) common executive leadership priorities (e.g., supporting financial stewardship and affordability, increasing the value of an undergraduate education, catalyzing innovative research) across our institutions, 2) how sustainability contributes to these priorities, and 3) how to measure these contributions quantitatively and qualitatively. The resulting Big Ten Prospectus, and extensions of the project through Second Nature, have provided us a new language--capable of describing sustainability, carbon neutrality and resilience's value using the terms and concepts embedded in mission level priorities--for supporting our work, from engaging executive leaders to stakeholder engagement to program evaluation. This panel will address the evolution of this project, the processes we developed, strategies for using this new language, and reflections about where we need to go next.",Pennsylvania State University,4190,"University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",0032,Harvard University,4451,Second Nature,0123,Purdue University,4793,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,"communications,value of sustainability",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Emilie Rex,Sustainability/Resilience Consultant,,,Denice Wardrop,Senior Scientist,Pennsylvania State University,4190,Shane Stennes,Director of Sustainability,"University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",0032,Leith Sharp,"Director, Executive Education for Sustainability Leadership",Harvard University,4451,Ruby Woodside,Innovative Services Manager,Second Nature,0123,Michael Gulich,Director of Campus Master Planning and Sustainability,Purdue University,4793,,,,,,,,,,,,
Multiple Approaches to Successfully Sustaining Your Campus as a Teaching and Living Laboratory,"The concept of using campus buildings, grounds, infrastructure, resources, and systems to support research and learning in sustainability is widely accepted and recognized by assessments like STARS. This workshop will address the need to make such efforts sustainable as they transition from trial projects to ongoing programs on your campus. The focus will be on the roles of campus sustainability staff as managers, advisors, subject matter experts, collaborators, funders, and matchmakers for campus-as-a-laboratory efforts. We will present several different models currently in use across six campuses that emphasize different foundations for program success, including: focus on available physical resources, such as dedicated spaces (Furman University); focus on defining projects and deliverables for capstone courses (University of North Carolina at Charlotte), facilitating non-capstone projects (NC State University), supporting research theses (Duke University), enabling on-campus field site immersion (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill); and creating curriculum modules (University of Georgia). We will share methodologies for planning and coordination, such as: campus needs assessments and resource mapping (UNCC); managing client-based projects (NC State); using a theme to catalyze living lab activity (UGA), peer-to-peer faculty engagement (UNCCH); and assessing cost/time versus impact (Furman).",North Carolina State University,3655,Furman University,3836,The University of Georgia,2188,Duke University,1336,"University of North Carolina, Charlotte",0725,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Curriculum,,,,living labs,10/15/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Tracy Dixon,Sustainability Director,North Carolina State University,3655,Laura Bain,Associate Director of Sustainability Assessment,Furman University,3836,Tyra Byers,Program Coordinator,The University of Georgia,2188,Tavey Capps,Sustainability Director,Duke University,1336,Michael Lizotte,University Sustainability Officer,"University of North Carolina, Charlotte",0725,,,,,,,,,,,,,1300_Dixon_2381.pdf,,,
Fishing for Solutions: How Sourcing Sustainable and Affordable Seafood Fits into Your Campus Foodservice and Sustainability Programs,"What's for dinner? Fish! And a chance to promote ocean conservation, increase seafood consumption on campus, and engage students in sustainability. Chefs, nutritionists and food activists have advised an increase in seafood consumption, but the traditional seafood supply chain is riddled with fraud, slave labor, and environmental issues. Choosing the right fish to serve in college foodservice programs shapes the global seafood industry, our health, and the health of our oceans. In this workshop, you'll take a fast-paced journey through how institutions transition to sustainable seafood. We share lessons learned from leading foodservice programs on using campus engagement and innovative sourcing to help universities serve healthy, delicious, sustainable and affordable seafood that aligns with campus values and budget, like West Coast Groundfish and the Atlantic Spiny Dogfish. We'll look at how sustainability leaders can engage their foodservice managers, chefs, and suppliers to support the recovery of their domestic waterways.

Incorporating Sustainability in Traditional Writing and Humanities Courses,"In this session, participants will learn about two different approaches to incorporating sustainability in First-Year Composition courses. The first presentation will report on a pilot project that aimed to model small scale, discipline-focused collection and dissemination of sustainability infused syllabi and course materials. Presenters will explain project goals, dynamics that make this intervention difficult to maintain and insights received into why acceptance and curricular follow through has been hard to achieve. Presenters will offer best practice recommendations for faculty and researchers from other disciplines who may be interested in opening a line of inquiry into sustainability curricula in their own local disciplinary communities. The second presentation will exemplify how two instructors, at a Hispanic-Serving Institution, redesigned their First-Year Writing courses around the social dimension of sustainability to empower students considered academically under-prepared for college work. Presenters will talk about how to recognize students' diverse experiences, and their socio-cultural, linguistic, and educational backgrounds. Presenters will show a 15-week course design that guides students to explore embedded social issues affecting their local communities. Participants will be invited to reflect on their teaching methods and discuss best practices to infuse their courses with innovative pedagogies that strengthen student learning.",Texas A&M University-Texarkana,7987,University of Arkansas,4466,University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,3868,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,Humanities (except languages),,"first year experience,courses",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Joseph Burzynski,Assistant Professor of English,Texas A&M University-Texarkana,7987,Erin Gloster,Student,University of Arkansas,4466,Joshua McGuire,Graduate Student,Texas A&M University-Texarkana,7987,Marcela Hebbard,,University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,3868,Yemin Sanchez,"Writing & Language Studies, Lecturer II",University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,3868,,,,,,,,,,,,,1130_Hebbard.pdf,,,
Best Practices for Supporting Campus Food Security,"Hunger is present on college campuses across the United States. As literature increases, awareness surrounding challenges in supporting severely food insecure college students has become more apparent, as well. This session will examine programs at Arizona State University, Southern Illinois University, and the University of Utah aimed at reducing food waste and/or increasing food access for students with the aim of alleviating short-term hunger and food insecurity. As longer-term strategic interventions, these programs concurrently aim to redress underlying issues affecting students' food insecurity by providing holistic, sustainable, multifaceted and resilient interventions related to systemic inequities",Arizona State University,4531,Southern Illinois University Carbondale,3682,University of Utah,3994,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Waste,,,,"food security,hunger,food waste",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Kaysey England,,Arizona State University,4531,Rebecca Bender,Undergraduate Student,Arizona State University,4531,Geory Kurtzhals,Sustainability Coordinator,Southern Illinois University Carbondale,3682,Shannon Jones,"Associate Instructor, Project Lead: Food, Movement, and U.",University of Utah,3994,Nick Knight,Student,University of Utah,3994,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Jones.pdf,,,
A Guide to Using the new Campus Carbon and Nitrogen Footprint Tool,"A new version of the web-based Campus Carbon Calculator will be launched in fall 2017: SIMAP (Sustainability Indicator Management and Analysis Platform). Join us for this session to learn about the new and exciting features of this integrated tool, including additional environmental impacts (nitrogen pollution) and sectors (food). What new environmental impacts are in SIMAP? With your data entry, the tool will calculate both your carbon and nitrogen footprint. The nitrogen footprint will quantify your campus' impact on nitrogen pollution, which contributes to environmental impacts ranging from the local scale (water quality, air quality, biodiversity loss) to the global scale (climate change, the ozone hole). What are the new sectors in SIMAP? Food purchases, which have an upstream carbon and nitrogen footprint, will be an important addition. The tool will quantify how different food purchases will impact your footprints. What features will SIMAP incorporate? The updated platform has a more user-friendly and reliable interface. Other new features include import/export with Excel, customizable emissions factors, and an improved results dashboard. At this session, we will present SIMAP, demonstrate its use, facilitate interactive breakout groups (please bring your laptops!), and answer questions.

"Breaking Through the ""Green Ceiling"": Sustainability as a Path to Executive Leadership","One way to measure the value of sustainability in higher education is to determine whether any of our more experienced and successful members have climbed the ladder and been promoted to executive-level positions, such as VP, EVP/Provost or even President. If not, why not? Is there a 'green ceiling?' If so, how might we overcome these limiting stereotypes? Granted, oversight of sustainability for a college or university is still a relatively young profession, 20 years at most. But, if we are as interdisciplinary, all-encompassing and mission-critical to the academy as our recent AASHE-developed value statement would suggest, that should be enough time to see sustainability professionals rising to these kinds of senior leadership positions. This one-hour panel discussion will examine these issues from multiple perspectives, including that of a senior administrator, NACUBO director, and executive search consultant. We'll also summarize relevant results from AASHE's 2017 sustainability staffing survey, which indicate how close (or far) we are from the top leadership positions, based on the traditional executive-readiness metrics of salary, reporting structure, job title, education level, budget, staff and direct reports. Are we perceived as broad generalists and collaborative managers, who work across our institutions, or as narrow specialists, lacking in management experience? We'll also discuss ways to break through the 'green ceiling' and maximize leadership potential.",University of Connecticut,2131,National Association of College & University Business Officers,2385,Princeton University,2597,AASHE,5016,Korn Ferry International,8306,,,,,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"executives,sustainability officers,professional development,leadership",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Rich Miller,Director,University of Connecticut,2131,Sally Grans Korsh,"Director, Facilities Management & Environmental Policy",National Association of College & University Business Officers,2385,Kyu Whang,Vice President for Facilities,Princeton University,2597,Monika Urbanski,Data & Content Manager,AASHE,5016,Paul Chou,Co-Managing Director,Korn Ferry International,8306,,,,,,,,,,,,,1130_Miller_2191.pptx,,,

Aligning Endowment Investments with the Paris Climate Agreement & the Sustainable Development Goals,"The past few years have seen a surge in interest and activity around how endowment investment practices can be better aligned with institutional mission, values, and sustainability goals. In large part, this activity has been driven by stakeholder calls for divestment from fossil fuels. Whether or not they divest, endowment decision-makers are increasingly looking for opportunities to align investments with sustainability goals and shift capital to sustainability solutions. The Paris Climate Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a compelling framework to contextualize the sustainability leadership of American colleges and universities. This session will include a moderated discussion among leaders in the higher ed sustainability movement and investment professionals about how the Paris Agreement and SDGs can serve as a framework for endowment investing. Through facilitated dialogue exercises, participants of this session will share where their institutions stand in terms of sustainable endowment investing, learn how to leverage this framework to enhance endowment investing, and be invited to join and help shape the future of the Intentional Endowments Network.",Global Endowment Management,8297,Intentional Endowments Network,7689,Edison Energy,8202,Second Nature,0123,,,,,,,Investment & Finance,Coordination & Planning,Public Engagement,,,"endowment,Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),climate commitments,Paris Climate Agreement",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Meredith Heimburger,Director of Sustainability,Global Endowment Management,8297,Nicole Harman,Program Associate,Intentional Endowments Network,7689,Christopher O'Brien,Director of Higher Education Programs; Adjunct Faculty,Edison Energy,8202,Janna Cohen-Rosenthal,Climate Programs Director,Second Nature,0123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Harman_2523.pdf,,,
"Comparing Move Out Programs: Sharing Perspectives on Waste Diversion, Campus & Community Collaboration, & Sustainability Goals.","Be part of an interactive discussion where 4 universities share their move out program from the perspectives of Housing, Sustainability, Facilities & Surplus & learn ways to advance sustainability, reuse & diversion strategies, & effective university and community collaboration models. Partnerships within campus & the community are vital for the successful coordination of move out programs. Laurier's program includes on & off campus students & invites community stakeholders to share perspectives & issues. Students there created the Something Golden program which resells items collected during move out to students. UI's program was also student initiated & has grown into a community-wide collaboration where partners are represented on the move out committee. This committee plans & implements a 4-day collection event. UW-Madison & CSU Surplus each partner with their respective Housing Departments to facilitate collection of donated items during move out. Hundreds of hours are spent processing thousands of pounds of items for recycling, sale, & donation.

Meatless Monday on Campus: How to VEG (or BEEF) up Your Campus Sustainability Efforts by Connecting to Students Through Food,"At the AASHE conference, Meatless Monday is how we connect sustainability through our food choices. In this session, we'll explore how to use the same approach to leverage Meatless Monday on your campus to help boost sustainability efforts, engage students through food, and help attract new students. Meatless Monday is one of the best-known initiatives for reducing meat consumption and for catalyzing changes in our diets. Since 2003, hundreds of campuses have implemented Meatless Monday. How it's done varies greatly - from promoting vegetarian specials to eliminating all meat on Monday. Until now, little has been done to look at the best way to change what we eat, Leading work by the Center for a Livable Future at Johns Hopkins, presented at the Paris Climate Conference, show that dietary change is a key part of achieving national and global climate goals, and that we will likely fall short without eating less meat. CLF interviewed college food service operators across the country to understand of how Meatless Monday is implemented, how it is perceived by students, staff and the larger institutions, and the extent to which it can help change student what they eat. This session will explore best practices for implementing Meatless Monday and meat reduction efforts on your campus food service program, how to get buy in and work with your foodservice team and other leaders on campus, and the power of college foodservice to change what we eat in the US and globally,",Changing Tastes,8296,The Monday Campaigns,8220,Johns Hopkins University,0515,Bon Appétit Management Company,0873,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,,,,"vegan & vegetarian dining,meatless campaigns",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Arlin Wasserman,Partner,Changing Tastes,8296,Cherry Dumaual,PR & Partnerships Director,The Monday Campaigns,8220,Becky Ramsing,Center for a Livable Future,Johns Hopkins University,0515,Piper Fernwey,Community Programs and Sustainability Support Manager,Bon Appétit Management Company,0873,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045_Wasserman_2117.pdf,,,
Exploring the Web-based Promotion of Sustainability in KBOR Institutions: Strategies for Design & Implications for Practice,"To more fully understand how the concept of sustainability is represented by institutions of higher education in the state of Kansas, a scoping review of web-based content through university websites was conducted. The comparative content analysis assessed the online promotional strategies used to feature sustainability content by Kansas Board of Regents institutions (KBOR) (e.g., Emporia State, Fort Hays State, Kansas State, University of Kansas, Wichita State and Pittsburg State). Several broad categories were created to examine website functionality and content value including: website characteristics, sustainability concept and definition, institutional commitment, sustainability impacts and outcomes, community and partner recognition, resources and support, as well as other general content claims.

Sustainable Transportation Programs: Nationwide Trends & Practical Case Studies,"Emissions created by commuting-related activities are a major component of many institution's greenhouse gas inventories. Yet, these emissions sources are notoriously difficult to mitigate. There are a number of ways an institution can attempt to reduce these emissions by promoting commuter-targeted policies and programs. An analysis of AASHE STARS v.2.0 data shows that: 84% of institutions have implemented public transit/shuttle services; 29% offer incentives to live closer to work; and 23% are Bicycle Friendly Universities. This panel will begin with a brief overview of nationwide transportation trends. Then, shift to a focus on case studies of institutions that have successfully launched transportation programs. Eric Boles (from University of Arkansas) will provide insights about his institution's efforts to certify and improve ranking as a Bicycle Friendly University. Megan Litke (from American University) will provide insights about her institution's collaboration with the local transit authority to provide affordable and accessible public transit options.

Building a Culture of Sustainability through New Student Orientation,"The mission of the Sustainability Ambassadors program is to motivate, inspire, and lead Boston University's efforts in supporting a culture of sustainability during new student orientation. The approach to incorporating sustainability principles is a five-pronged effort. The main effort includes face-to-face engagement with new students and families, making operations like food waste sorting more transparent, a 'Did You Know' poster campaign, maintaining interim communications with new students, and finally, layering sustainability awareness into the Common Ground program-an opportunity for new Terriers to have meaningful discussions while exploring their new city. This presentation will highlight the outcomes of this innovative peer-to-peer outreach program and show how working within the existing student affairs structure can be advantageous for all departments. The highlights of the Sustainability Ambassadors pilot program and its second year will be shared, including heightened awareness of sustainability concepts such as energy reduction and even related course offerings for new students. Boston University is a diverse, international community that is home to students from 50 states and 133 nations.

Diverse Paths to Success: Three High-Impact Infrastructure Projects that Reduced Energy Consumption and Emissions,"Despite lower utility costs and longer payback periods, sustainability outcomes across Higher Education continue to improve through investment in utility & systems upgrades. According to data from the joint 2016 State of Sustainability report from Univ of New Hampshire and Sightlines, avg energy consumption per GSF is down 8% vs. a 2007 baseline. At the same time there has been a rapid transition to lower emissions fuels and zero emission renewables both on-campus and across utility grids. As a result, avg emissions per GSF are down 14% vs. a 2007 baseline. Institutions have taken diverse paths to achieve success and this panel will bring together a mix of institutions (small & large, public & private) to share high impact case studies highlighting successful energy efficiency and fuel switching infrastructure projects: -Rider University, via central plant overhaul, reduced carbon intensity of electricity by 54% -Bowling Green State University, via chiller loop overhaul, reduced electric consumption 29% -West Chester University, via fuel switching, reduced emissions 55% The panel will begin with a brief overview of national trends.

Athletics as a Resource for Advancing Campus Sustainability Goals,"In 2016, with the support of the White House, the Green Sports Alliance announced October 6th as the inaugural Green Sports Day to celebrate the power of sports as an agent for positive change. Included in that White House initiative were pledges from several campuses and a Power 5 college athletics conference to elevate the role of sports as part of higher education's contribution to sustainability. College sports has the unique potential to advance this work by bringing together stakeholders not typically represented in campus sustainability conversations. With the distinctive ways in which universities are structured comes a distinct set of challenges requiring two campus departments that do not typically work together to share, learn and collaborate. Bridging this gap between sustainability and athletics opens up a multitude of innovative and cost-effective opportunities that can accelerate sustainable change across a university. This session will highlight powerful sustainability-athletics partnerships that have successfully overcome the challenges that are unique to implementing campus sustainability goals in sports. Speakers will provide strategies for connecting with athletics departments and leveraging the ubiquity of sports to raise awareness and change behavior across key campus stakeholders.",University of Colorado Boulder,2130,Green Sports Alliance,7764,The Ohio State University,2335,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,Athletics & Recreation,athletics,10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,David Newport,"Director, Environmental Center",University of Colorado Boulder,2130,Rahul Devaskar,Membership Manager,Green Sports Alliance,7764,Thomas Reeves,Director--Energy Management & Sustainability,The Ohio State University,2335,Graham Oberly,Sustainability Coordinator--Department of Athletics,The Ohio State University,2335,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Devaskar.pptx,,,
From the Southeast to the UN: Reflections from GA & SC on Applying for and Launching New Regional Centres of Expertise,"Using sustainability education as a platform for building community and catalyzing social and environmental change in our regions has never been more important than it is right now. Sustainability education is especially valuable because the systems approaches that it highlights reveal connections across siloed groups and issues and links between global and local challenges and solutions. In this session, sustainability leaders from Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University in Atlanta, GA and Coastal Carolina University in Georgetown County, SC share their experiences bringing together broad groups of stakeholders from the academic, government, business, nonprofit, and community sectors to apply for and establish new UN University Regional Centres of Expertise. At the time of the AASHE conference, the Georgetown RCE will be in the middle of its first year and Metro Atlanta will have completed a year-long process building interest in the RCE and submitting its application. Kim Smith, Coordinator of the well-established Greater Portland RCE and a mentor to the Atlanta group, will facilitate a conversation about embarking on the RCE journey as higher education institutions focused largely on undergraduate education; why RCEs are a key strategy for collaboration, especially in these times and in the Southeastern U.S.; key successes and challenges to date, and why they are similar to and different from each other; and goals and aspirations for our first two years.",Georgia Institute of Technology,1109,Emory University,3931,Coastal Carolina University,4036,Portland Community College,2505,,,,,,,Public Engagement,,,,,regional focus,10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Jennifer Hirsch,"Director, Center for Serve-Learn-Sustain",Georgia Institute of Technology,1109,Ciannat Howett,Director of Sustainability,Emory University,3931,Pamela Martin,Professor,Coastal Carolina University,4036,Kimberley Smith,Sociology Instructor,Portland Community College,2505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prioritizing Sustainable Learning,"Many of today's colleges and universities have prioritized sustainability and, as a consequence, highly sustainable buildings and landscapes. And, without a doubt, both prospective and current students have expressed a deep interest in and commitment to sustainable measures. But, are students truly learning from high performance buildings? Are they discovering opportunities to study sustainability or systems thinking outside their major and take those lessons with them when they graduate? If higher education's core mission is education, are we dedicating enough energy to learning outcomes in new projects? The evidence may surprise you. Please join our panel of professors, designers, and facility directors in discussing this topic. We'll look at a framework for sustainable learning in the built environment. And we'll imagine how colleges and universities can shift the focus from high performing buildings and landscapes to actively engaging a broad spectrum of students.",CannonDesign,5761,University of South Alabama,2924,Loyola University Chicago,1865,University of Texas at Austin,3049,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,"green buildings,living labs,experiential learning",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Doug Campbell,,CannonDesign,5761,Krista Harrell,Student Center Director and Title IX Coordinator,University of South Alabama,2924,Aaron Durnbaugh,Director of Sustainability,Loyola University Chicago,1865,Jim Walker,Director of Sustainability,University of Texas at Austin,3049,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Teaching Climate Change Across the Curriculum,"The complexities of climate change can only be understood through multiple disciplinary lenses. Faculty at Southwestern University and Trinity University have developed curricula that promote interdisciplinary student learning about this complex, challenging topic. At Trinity University, faculty from diverse disciplinary backgrounds developed a course that promotes first-year student learning about the topic. Course design took place as part of a major revision of the university's curriculum. A cornerstone of this curriculum is the First Year Experience (FYE), a 6-credit-hour course that emphasizes student learning in written and oral communication through 'a topic of widespread or enduring significance.' Southwestern University has undertaken a 'Climate Change Across the Curriculum' initiative to inspire and better prepare faculty to include assignments, conversations, and even just more passing references to climate change in their courses. Our initiative includes a faculty survey, teacher/scholar luncheons, faculty book groups, faculty presentations on 'climate essentials,' and a full day faculty development workshop. In this presentation, we will describe Trinity's and Southwestern's successes and lessons learned to date. The audience will be invited to share their experiences around expanding climate change in their courses, and we will discuss how to overcome some of the obstacles to engaging with this topic in our classrooms.",Trinity University,2593,Southwestern University,3154,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Air & Climate,,,,"climate change,courses,course development",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,David Ribble,Professor of Biology,Trinity University,2593,Kelly Lyons,Associate Professor,Trinity University,2593,Benjamin Surpless,Associate Professor,Trinity University,2593,Emily Northrop,,Southwestern University,3154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1130_Surpless.pptx,,,
Accelerating Sustainability Integration through Strategic Leadership,"Positioning the institution's highest-ranking sustainability professional within an executive level leadership team is essential for advancing institutional strategy and readiness for change. C-suite sustainability provides transformational leadership that is urgently needed in higher education and beyond, as indicated by the growing number of such positions in corporations. Yet, according to the 2015 AASHE staffing survey, this slice of the profession is as yet very small: no more than 4% of sustainability positions report to presidents/chancellors. This panel highlights people and organizational structures aligned with or moving toward Core Business Integration of Sustainability (CBIS) and transformational leadership. This unique panel comprises sustainability leaders who report to presidents, chancellors, or provosts. Panelists represent a variety of institutions, each of which has implemented a senior sustainability leadership position. Through a facilitated discussion, panelists will address why sustainability integration matters at the highest levels of institutional leadership and describe their roles as senior leaders in their respective institutions.

Sustainability Summer Camps on Campus,"This workshop highlights examples from two schools utilizing the resources of campus during the summer months through sustainability-focused day camps for kids. At the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Sarita Wetland is a site for experiential environmental education and demonstration of sustainable stormwater management. In 2016, the University offered a summer day camp focused on the journey of water on campus. The camp brought more than 50 young children, together with ecologists and civil engineers, to Sarita to explore and care for this place that symbolizes campus sustainability. Students followed the journey of rain and drinking water, tracing pipes and culverts, and created a narrative with their own photos, illustrations, and learnings on an interactive GIS map. In 2016, Central College in Pella, Iowa created 'Fun with Food' camp for 8-12 year olds focused on gardening, cooking, and nutrition. The camp featured field trips to local farms and a farmers market, activities in the college garden, and a final cooking competition pairing teams of kids with college dining staff. In 2017, we added a second camp focused on sustainable energy, visiting solar, wind, and hydro projects on and near campus. Participants in this session will hear lessons learned and will leave with the tools to develop their own camps, building K-12 connections and creating new opportunities for faculty, staff, and student engagement.","University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",0032,Macalester College,4603,Central College,4371,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,"k-12,recreation",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Elizabeth Mercer-Taylor,Sustainability Education Coordinator,"University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",0032,Suzanne Savanick Hansen,Sustainability Manager,Macalester College,4603,Brian Campbell,Director of Sustainability Education,Central College,4371,Sara Shuger Fox,Assistant Professor of Exercise Science,Central College,4371,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These two benchmarks are: a) Create a campus/community task force or introduce the resilience planning framework into an existing campus/community structure, and b) Complete a resilience capacity assessment including preliminary progress indicators. Participants in this session will learn about the progress of the CRUX project over the last year and gain insights into the lessons learned in the 3 cluster cities. We will discuss the structure of the project and the partnerships both within and without the Climate leadership Network (CLN), the progress to date of each of the 6 partner institutions, and the relationships that have been built between the partner campuses and the 3 city communities. Special attention will be paid to adapting and scaling project learning throughout the CLN.",Second Nature,0123,Arizona State University,4531,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Public Engagement,,,,"resilience,community partnerships,urban focus",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Tim Carter,President,Second Nature,0123,Liz Golden,CRUX Fellow,Second Nature,0123,Thea Kindschuh,CRUX Fellow Portland,Second Nature,0123,Brian Grant,Climate Resilience Program Assistant,Arizona State University,4531,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1130_Kindschuh_2264.pdf,,,
Learning the Language of Executive Leadership to Increase Sustainability's Value,"With higher education facing a new political landscape, ongoing budget cuts and an affordability crisis, among other challenges, sustainability professionals must be able to define and communicate sustainability's value core institutional priorities. Building on the Big Ten and Friends Sustainability Group's foundational work and contributions from Second Nature, this workshop will lead participants through hands-on exercises and discussions aimed at: 1) identifying their institution's mission-level priorities (e.g., supporting financial stewardship and affordability, increasing the value of a degree, diversity and inclusion); 2) assessing how sustainability, climate neutrality, and/or resilience contribute to these priorities; and 3) developing strategies for using this new language-which describes the value of sustainability, climate neutrality or resilience using the terms and concepts embedded in executive leadership priorities-to support everything from strategic planning to stakeholder engagement to program implementation and evaluation.",U.S. Green Building Council,1493,Pennsylvania State University,4190,Purdue University,4793,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,"executives,leadership,value of sustainability",10/15/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Emilie Rex,Sustainability/Resilience Consultant,,,Josh Lasky,,U.S. Green Building Council,1493,Denice Wardrop,Senior Scientist,Pennsylvania State University,4190,Michael Gulich,Director of Campus Master Planning and Sustainability,Purdue University,4793,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Getting Traction with Large-Scale Renewable Energy Procurement: Finding Your Sweet-Spot and Effectively Communicating About It,"Technology cost reductions and favorable market economics make large-scale renewable energy an increasingly compelling choice for campuses to make step-change improvements in their GHG footprint while also reducing long-term cost and risk of electricity procurement. Still, decision makers face a spectrum of options for their institution to benefit from large-scale renewables . Moreover, project leaders need to effectively communicate about their renewables engagement to get traction, now and in the future. This interactive and action-oriented session will cover two critical areas to get traction with large-scale renewable energy procurement: 1. understanding the energy options, and 2. communicating effectively to build buy-in and keep internal and external stakeholders engaged. In a first step, participants will be introduced to the options along the large-scale renewables spectrum, profiling risk and return, to identify their sweet spot between on- and off-campus solutions, as single off-taker or as aggregated buyer in an off-taker group, while understanding the implications of acting now or later. In a second step, the session will present practical insights on how to build effective communication strategies around large-scale renewable energy. Two case studies of leading universities that have pursued solutions at opposite ends of the spectrum will provide practical insights into respective motivations, goals, approaches, returns and communication strategies.",George Washington University,4003,CustomerFirst Renewables,7676,Michigan State University,0439,,,,,,,,,Energy,Investment & Finance,,,,"renewable energy,large-scale renewable energy procurement",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Kimberly Williams,Stakeholder Engagement Associate,George Washington University,4003,Susanne Fratzscher,Director BD,CustomerFirst Renewables,7676,Ann Erhardt,Director of Sustainability,Michigan State University,0439,Garrett Sprague,,CustomerFirst Renewables,7676,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Innovative Financing Options and the University Solar Deployment Process,"This workshop session will highlight new, high-impact ways in which higher education institutions can finance solar deployment, including making investments via endowments. In this session, EPA will review emerging solar financing options including power purchase agreements (PPAs), student fees, green revolving funds, donations, and unique alumni and community arrangements. NREL will highlight key lessons learned from universities using solar PPAs. The Intentional Endowments Network will focus on how endowment capital can be leveraged to make these investments, using examples to lay out steps stakeholders can take to enable endowment managers to support campus projects. Following a description of solar financing options, the Midwest Renewable Energy Association will compare the financial performance of different options using their publicly-available Solar Project Financial Simulator. Finally, Sustainable Capital Advisors will highlight key inputs into the Solar Project Financial Simulator and discuss what investors are looking for when making investments.

From Gown to Town: Bringing the Benefits of Solar Energy to the Community,"Solar energy programs present a unique opportunity between colleges and their communities. We'll explore three areas where collaboration on and off campus are making a difference, including programs that create training opportunities for students interested in entering the solar industry, collaborative procurement that results in low prices for colleges and community members, and colleges that are helping improve local permitting processes to make it easier for all community members to go solar. Hear from the University of Minnesota Duluth about providing students with hands-on solar experience in the local community. Through campus courses, students are building real-world experience by researching and vetting solar energy proposals to residences and businesses in the community, and are engaging a wide variety of local stakeholders from small business owners to farmers to homeowners on the benefits of renewable energy. Through training program developed by the Midwest Renewable Energy Association, students are prepared for a workforce by completing on campus solar certification trainings and matching them with cost-share internships in the local solar industry.","University of Minnesota, Duluth",0018,Midwest Renewable Energy Association,7608,Institute for Sustainable Communities,8299,Council of Independent Colleges in Virginia,7715,,,,,,,Energy,Public Engagement,,,,"solar,town-gown",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Mindy Granley,Sustainability Director,"University of Minnesota, Duluth",0018,Jane Cowan,Market Research Coordinator,Midwest Renewable Energy Association,7608,Nicole Enright,Program Officer,Institute for Sustainable Communities,8299,Lora Toothman,"Project Manager, Solar Market Pathways",Council of Independent Colleges in Virginia,7715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Granley_2340.pdf,0915_Cowan_2340.pdf,0915_Granley_2340_1101_104532.pdf,
Fulfilling an Academic Mission by Building as a Teaching Tool: Virginia Wesleyan University's Greer Environmental Sciences Center,"The Greer Environmental Sciences Center honors former President Greer's long-standing commitment to environmental sustainability and advocacy for a thriving science program at VWU. Completing the College's main quadrangle, the building acts as a 'portal' for students traversing campus and connects them to the Center's mission by showcasing the dynamic program housed within. As a gateway to the sciences, the Center serves VWU students and faculty as well as the wider region's environmental sciences community-including the Virginia Aquarium, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, and WHRO Public Media-who now have a physical platform for partnering with the College. The Center celebrates place-based research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and hands-on learning-key tenants of the College's science program and academic mission. It puts science 'on display' with fully glazed walls on quad-facing labratories and classrooms, exposing science and scientific exploration. Complementing this programmatic transparency, interactive details animate the building as a teaching tool. Sustainable features and educational signage are strategically placed for students to observe and monitor the building's use of energy, water, and material resources. The photovoltaic array and green roof are visible and accessible for students to enjoy and analyze. Vegetated bioretention basins and constructed wetlands treat stormwater and remove pollutants in inventive ways whose efficacy may be studied by students.","VMDO Architects, PC",7865,Virginia Wesleyan College,0408,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,,,,,building design,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Michelle Amt,Director of Sustainability,"VMDO Architects, PC",7865,Maynard Schaus,Associate Provost and Professor of Biology,Virginia Wesleyan College,0408,Soraya Bartol,Professor Marine Biology and Director of Undergraduate Research,Virginia Wesleyan College,0408,Joe Atkins,Principal,"VMDO Architects, PC",7865,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Amt_2542.pdf,,,
Breaking Boundaries in Sustainability Education,"What brings together faculty in Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Sports Management and Gender, Women and Sexuality Studies? A new cohort-based fellowship program, hosted by the University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment (IonE), is designed to bring together faculty as they develop sustainability curriculum innovations. To tackle the obstacles to living sustainably, we need innovative teaching, collaboration across disciplines and creativity. Hear how the IonE Educators overcame boundaries and reached new audiences, not usually associated with sustainability. During their fellowship year, IonE Educators pursued projects around effective pedagogy and curriculum development. The first cohort found surprising opportunities to collaborate as they incorporated multiple perspectives in solving complex sustainability challenges. Ned Mohan is creating a statewide high school course for the College in the Schools program that incorporates contemporary approaches to renewable resources. Tiffany Richardson is using professional sports to promote student learning, behavior change and fan engagement. Michelle Garvey is creating a course that meshes gender studies and environmental justice.

"Longitudinal Sustainability Literacy and Culture Assessment for Students, Faculty, and Staff - Lessons Learned and Results","As more institutions increase their focus on sustainability both academically and operationally, the need for measurement increases. Currently, there is no common tool for measuring sustainability literacy, the culture of sustainability, and the effectiveness of education and outreach efforts on campuses. We have spent the last few years reviewing efforts in this space from across the country and developing our own tools. We will review a Sustainability Literacy, Culture, and Applied Knowledge survey, a Sustainability Knowledge Assessment, and a Sustainability Cultural Indicators program. We will outline the tools we reviewed, highlight changes we made over the years to develop a more effective tool of measuring literacy, culture, and applied knowledge on campus, and discuss evaluation and monitoring over time. These efforts can be cumbersome and we hope that this work can continue to evolve so others can have a streamlined approach and perhaps work toward a common approach.",Arizona State University,4531,University of Michigan,1744,Michigan State University,0439,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,,,"sustainability literacy,assessment,campus culture",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Corey Hawkey,Assistant Director,Arizona State University,4531,John Callewaert,"Emerging Opportunities Director, Graham Sustainability Institute",University of Michigan,1744,Adam Zwickle,Assistant Professor,Michigan State University,0439,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Hawkey_2261.pptx,,,
Black Hills Food Hub: Rural Food Hubs Serving a Wider Demographic,"Black Hills State University and Spearfish community partners are creating a culture that supports and values local food in order to expand the reach and depth of our regional local food economy. The Black Hills Food Hub, launched in October 2016, is unique in that it benefits a large number of citizens from a wide demographic. A food hub takes the produce from many farms, adds it all together, and then sells it to customers. This allows some farmers to specialize in a few crops that they prefer to grow and to have a venue for sales that they otherwise would not have. The food hub eliminates barriers of purchasing local food on cafeteria management, reducing the time and organization needed for both ordering and delivery. Additionally, large-quantity commitments from buyers lend unprecedented support to the local food economy. While a food hub in itself is not unique today, we have taken the food hub model beyond the traditional catering to high-end restaurants and marketed local food instead to cafeterias. By servings cafeterias, the Black Hills Food Hub aims to get local food to the greatest number of people from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, the Black Hills Food Hub is unique to the area and designed to be replicable in remote and rural areas, where high-end dining is few and far between. The food hub delivers food on the same day as picked from the field, ensuring the highest quality product with unbeatable flavor and nutritional value.",Black Hills State University,0603,,,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Food & Dining,,,,"local foods,community partnerships",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Kathy Johnson,Vice President for Finance & Administration,Black Hills State University,0603,Randy Culver,Associate Vice President for Facilities & Sustainability,Black Hills State University,0603,Katie Greer,"Assistant Director, Facilities Services",Black Hills State University,0603,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Greer.pdf,,,

Thinking Beyond the Fork: Utilizing the Campus Food Truck as a Vehicle for Teaching Sustainability,"What do you get when you combine a university food truck, a chef, a farmer, and a FoodCorps service member? The University of North Carolina Wilmington's Campus Dining program along with local community partners Feast Down East, FoodCorps North Carolina, Centripetal Farms, and UNCW Sustainability have found a unique way to connect university resources and curriculum with experiential education in local public Title I elementary schools. With several farm to school events under their belt, this team has worked with students to make sweet potato pancakes from scratch, traveled to global food destinations, and is cooking up future plans to engage more students and their families. These meaningful community projects serve as a vehicle to promote sustainable engagement within the community. Through this outdoor, food truck classroom, university students are able to transfer knowledge and skills that will enable and empower younger generations to become more self-reliant and connected to sustainability related to their local food system. These skills include real world exposure to new types of food and cooking skills, developing an understanding of the benefits of purchasing local and growing one's own food, and making authentic connections to their classroom curriculum. This session will include a demonstration of this farm to school model, lessons learned, and recommendations and resources for application at other institutions.","University of North Carolina, Wilmington",0740,Aramark Higher Education,3691,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Food & Dining,,,,"k-12,local foods",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Marie Davis,Sustainability Coordinator,"University of North Carolina, Wilmington",0740,Matt Rogers,Resident District Manager,Aramark Higher Education,3691,Kat Pohlman,Sustainability Captain,"University of North Carolina, Wilmington",0740,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Davis_2208.pdf,,,
Translating sustainability education and community action into solidarity by engaging underrepresented students in living labs,"Living laboratories are increasingly becoming an important part of sustainability education at all levels. Many living laboratories enable participants to show 'internal' solidarity with classroom learning and 'external' solidarity with community actions. However, participants, particularly students of color, LGBTQ students, first generation students, and international students, are frequently underrepresented and may struggle to translate their own participation into real-world applications. Furthermore, developing, implementing, and measuring tangible outcomes regarding inclusivity and diversity in living laboratories is challenging. Colorado State University (CSU) and Dickinson College are two very different institutions; CSU is a large state institution with more than 33,000 students and Dickinson is a small, residential liberal arts institution with 2,400 students, but both have well-developed living laboratories that have many of the same successes and failures engaging and supporting underrepresented students. We believe that implementing a few key practices with living laboratories enables the generation of greater solidarity throughout the institution and community.",Dickinson College,3185,Colorado State University,0828,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,,,,"living labs,underrepresented groups",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Marcus Welker,Sustainability Learning Coordinator,Dickinson College,3185,Heather Reimer,Assistant Director,Colorado State University,0828,Tonie Miyamoto,,Colorado State University,0828,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Welker_2207.pptx,1445_Welker_2207.pdf,,

"Surplus Assets Deserve to be Reused, Not Discarded","Every school generates surplus assets, every day. Computers, dorm and classroom furniture, supplies, desks and chairs, bookcases and storage shelves. The list is endless. Sadly, even though they have years of remaining life, most of these assets end up in the trash. Reuse is a much better solution. At Western Kentucky, the Earn-A-Computer program (a partnership of the Surplus Dep't, IT staff, and Student Government Ass'n) refurbishes and awards a Mac computer to students who complete 35 hours of volunteer service. In its first semester, the program provided computers to 20 students and spawned 940 hours of service. At Colorado State, the Surplus Property Dep't goes campus-wide to capture thousands of surplus items each year. These are either resold (which funds the program, and returns money to campus departments), or recycled appropriately. As a result, essentially no usable surplus reaches the landfill. Working nationwide, IRN-The Reuse Network annually recovers millions of pounds of surplus assets from replacements and renovations, which are provided to charities for disaster relief and economic development. The process is simpler than calling in dumpsters, and the cost is less. Each of these programs is cost-effective. Each generates campus and community goodwill. Each yields large environmental and social benefits. And each is proven. Participants will leave this session with the practical knowledge to give surplus assets what they deserve: a new life.",Western Kentucky University,1816,IRN - The Recycling Network,6556,Colorado State University,0828,,,,,,,,,Waste,,,,,"reuse,surplus",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Elizabeth Gafford,Coordinator of Resource Conservation,Western Kentucky University,1816,Mark Lennon,,IRN - The Recycling Network,6556,Jake Drenth,,Colorado State University,0828,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Drenth.pptx,,,

Building Our Capacity for Taking Action Together,"Sustainability education needs more emphasis on developing skills necessary for students to engage in effective collective action (CA). This presentation will showcase coursework and projects at Green Mountain College and Daemen College that can serve as replicable models for integrating CA skills into campus and regional sustainability efforts. Four courses at Green Mountain College united by the theme 'Envisioning a Sustainable and Resilient North Country' served as the main vehicle for holistic development of CA skills. Students learned non-violent communication techniques applying them to the contentious issue of Syrian refugee resettlement locally. They learned how to create information artworks that could humanize abstract sustainability concepts and unify diverse audiences. After facilitating their own participatory process, they evaluated their skills and identified paths towards improvements. The Sustainable Design seminar at Daemen College was redesigned to more effectively guide students from clarifying problems and opportunities for intervention, through solution development and implementation, using 'we'deas to emphasize everyone's contributions to developing solutions. Existing online training resources from National Wildlife Federation Ecoleaders and others supplemented learning.

Bees on Campus: Student Engagement in Sustainable Practices,"Our presentation will discuss the benefits and implications of using beekeeping to engage university students, faculty and staff in sustainable practices. Our goal is to stress the importance of pollinators such as bees in both urban and rural environments, reflecting the diversity of university locations. Institutions such as the government and large companies are beginning to make sustainability more fashionable and accessible, but in order to change the culture surrounding it and get more people to participate to a greater extent, it is important to familiarize the public with practices such as beekeeping. Actions such as recycling and even gardening are more mainstream, but beekeeping is often seen as something exotic and exclusive. Colleges should give students the opportunity to keep bees on campus because of the enhancement of the culture of sustainable engagement and living. With the correct training and engagement, beekeeping can be easily practiced by anyone.

Social Learning Platform and Collaborative Design Process for a Net Positive Outdoor Sustainability Learning Center,"The Outdoor Education Space project is a process-centric approach to designing a net-positive education and retreat space that intends to procure community engagement by collectivizing the ideas presented and deliberated through a multi-stage process involving the campus, community, and industry collaborators. Rather than contract a company to design this space, we have chosen to design the space by utilizing a core team of students and professors with a broad variety of expertise. Our team is also, significantly, bringing the community into the design process. By involving the community voice early in development, we can look forward to having a shared space that is comfortable, usable, and inclusive for all members of the community. This process is critical to the success of the space; without a community's emotional investment into the space, we cannot hope to achieve the goal of a collectively designed space that is consistently full of activities, workshops, and learning opportunities pertaining to sustainability and the outdoors. Intrinsic to this project is the process we are developing that will go beyond sustainable building design. Our team is developing a broad-based, multi-stage, community charrette process to identify a rich set of desirable design elements and building attributes.

Catch: A Face-to-Face Dynamic Simulation Game for Teaching About Renewable Natural Resource Management and Sustainability,"Catch© is free, fun and innovative, face-to-face systems dynamic simulation game that responds to the need for new, core-competency based pedagogical resources for teaching about the challenges of transformative change and the forms of learning that are necessary to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Catch© was created as a response to Fishbanks, a game originally created by Dennis Meadows in 2001. Fishbanks, which has the goal of maximizing individual team's net worth, has been heralded as a superb tool for teaching about the 'Tragedy of the Commons'. Alternatively, Catch© uses two ostensibly conflicting goals to explore the possibility of eliciting a much broader and richer range of common pool resource management and decision-making. The game has two systems goals: (1) Catch as many fish as you can and (2) leave as many fish in the sea as possible and utilizes a common pool resource setting, with realistic resource dynamics, that produces a systematic effect on the socio-ecological simulated environment.

Supporting Students' Sustainability Learning and Emotional Resilience with Reflection and Contemplation,"How do we foster the cognitive complexity, ethical development, and personal resolve required for this 'sustainability century?' Tackling complex, systemic problems requires nuanced interdisciplinary understandings and the ability to engage multiple perspectives. It also requires profound cultural shifts and collective work among inclusive communities. This participatory session, suitable for faculty, student affairs staff, and other academic leaders, will provide a rationale as well as examples for incorporating reflective and contemplative practices into sustainability studies. These approaches help students pause, deepen their awareness, think more carefully, and work more effectively with the complexity and controversy they may face in the years ahead. Since 2009, a faculty learning community in the Pacific Northwest led by the Curriculum for the Bioregion Initiative has developed strategies to enhance students' capacities to listen across differences, navigate their fear, grief, and despair, build their understanding of the roots, scale, and interconnectedness of sustainability problems, and to engage in community as an antidote to paralysis and cynicism. Our goal is to strengthen students' resolve for long-term engagement and resilience in a future where sustainability is paramount. This workshop will share a number of these strategies and additional resources to build or deepen reflective and contemplative pedagogies with your students.","Evergreen State College, The",3959,Western Washington University,1876,Peninsula College,2022,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Wellbeing & Work,,,,"faculty learning communities,faculty",10/15/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Jean MacGregor,"Director, Curriculum for the Bioregion","Evergreen State College, The",3959,Marie Eaton,"Director, Palliative Care Institute",Western Washington University,1876,Holly Hughes,"Adjunct Faculty, English",Peninsula College,2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1300_MacGregor_2218.pdf,1300_MacGregor_2218_1010_162143.pdf,,
Throwing in the Towel: Lessons Learned from Launching a Paper Towel Compost Program,"Waste diversion is a common thread woven throughout Austin Community College District's sustainability goals. With 11 current campus locations and new facilities added continuously, the footprint of the district is substantial. ACC has gotten creative in identifying waste streams - even ones that you literally 'wash your hands of' - to realize its waste diversion goals. ACC has successfully implemented paper towel composting at 6 of its 11 campuses, with the aim to realize the program districtwide by September 1, 2017. There is also a complimentary organic composting program through the college's culinary arts program. These program helps ACC attain its waste diversion goals and aligns with the City of Austin's Zero Waste goal to achieve 90% diversion city-wide by 2040. Paper towel composting at ACC serves as a highly visible and participatory educational mechanism for the more than 43,000 students, faculty and staff who utilize restroom facilities. ACC values both education and the district's potential to inspire real change in the Austin area. In this session, ACC will share its lessons learned including ways to maximize program effectiveness while reducing cost and minimizing custodial maintenance requirements. The presentation will also discuss engagement tools and operational considerations to fully integrate paper towel composting into the fiber of the district.",Austin Community College,2066,,,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,"paper towels,compost",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Alyssa Halle-Schramm,,Austin Community College,2066,Caleb Crow,,Austin Community College,2066,Andy Kim,"Director, Energy & Sustainability",Austin Community College,2066,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_HalleSchramm_2450.pdf,,,
Student-led community food access initiative,"A student-led garden was started on the campus grounds at Johnson C. Smith University in the fall of 2012. This initiative was put into place to address food security issues in the community surrounding the university, which falls in a food insecure/food desert area as well as to create awareness within the student and campus population. The garden consists of 18 raised beds as well as a greenhouse, cold frame and aquaponics facility. We have also recently installed a walk-in refrigerator for produce conservation. Produce grown on our grounds in the initial three years of operation was given as food donation to the community free of cost, but we have subsequently, in the interest of sustainability partnered with our local health department to start a local farmers' market.

Jumping Through Hoops for Zero-Waste,"This presentation will guide students in how to work with different levels of administration like Athletics, Facilities, Sodexo, and sports fans. Often as students, it's hard to make connections with higher levels of administration and gain their undivided support. There will also be information about joining forces with other existing sustainability groups, and assurance that student-led programs can continue to be funded and ultimately transition cohesively from year to year. The presenters will use the Greening the Game zero-waste athletics initiative at the University of Arizona along with the Athletics Recycling team at the University of Denver as a concurrent case study. Both teams started in the early 2010s at their respective universities and have expanded into at least three sports since their inception. This presentation will also include best data tracking methods and reporting, detailing how to write one-page reports that catch the eye of the reader and highlight key numbers.

Finding the Sustainability Sweet Spot: Where Operations and Education Converge,"Education for sustainable development requires an interdisciplinary approach. Yet, few organizations are ready to embrace the dynamism that breeds collaborative academic success. Like academic disciplines, college operations are too frequently siloed, lack adequate resources, and take safe harbor in doing things the way they have always been done. Campus as a living laboratory can be used to bridge divides within and between academia and operations to truly institutionalize sustainability. In this interactive session, attendees will have a chance to problem solve to the benefit of the entire educational institution by using CaaLL. Additionally, attendees will learn about approaches taken at Portland Community College and the University of Calgary.

Sustaining Food and Housing Insecure Students on College Campuses,"Food insecurity or the lack of reliable access to sufficient quantities of affordable, nutritious food is common at colleges and universities across the country, undermining the educational success of thousands of students. Studies show food insecurity goes hand in hand with housing insecurity. Find out how students and staff at one multi district community college, increased their own fee to create housing grants and food bank partnerships at each campus. A partnership with the local food bank has increased available food on campus and allowed us to lift restrictions around how many times students can access food. With a very small green grant to purchase two refrigerators and a freezer our campus participation has increased by over 300% in the first term alone. Rather than cans of beans and tuna, we now offer fresh fruit, vegetables, dairy and meat. As we roll out our new housing grants for students (emergency grants for students who are on the brink of houselessness), we hope to see similar results and improved success rates for our students. Our presentation will showcase how our program was created and funded, how it has evolved over the years from small dark closets or a shelf in a corner to open easily accessed spaces that provide not only food, but housing grants, help with child care, transportation and resources for students.",Portland Community College,2505,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Food & Dining,Wellbeing & Work,,,"food security,food pantries,food banks,housing",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Kendi Esary,Director of Student Leadership Programs,Portland Community College,2505,Amanda Ellertson,Director of Student Life and Leadership,Portland Community College,2505,Josh Peters McBride,Director of Student Life and Leadership Programs,Portland Community College,2505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Esary_2265.pptx,,,
Using Sustainability-Themed Undergraduate Research Programs to Enhance Student Engagement in Research,"Sustainability research provides a framework for engaging undergraduate students from diverse disciplinary backgrounds. This session will discuss recruitment successes and opportunities for several sustainability-focused National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (NSF REU) sites - viewed here as representative examples of coordinated undergraduate research programs focused on sustainability. The over-arching goal is to provide suggestions, based on assessment data from these on-going REU sites, that will increase knowledge about opportunities to offer sustainability-focused research programs for undergraduate students. Session leaders are NSF REU site directors at the Universities of Buffalo, Nebraska-Lincoln, and South Dakota. They will individually describe their REU's applicants, participants, and faculty mentors. Then farther-reaching conclusions will be described about ways to ensure a diverse applicant pool and better engage diverse participants. Specifically, the team will relate undergraduate student interest to host department (e.g., natural science vs. engineering vs. social science), faculty mentor department, and project type (e.g., lab-, field-, or modeling-focused). The expectation is that the discussion will benefit faculty and staff interested in using undergraduate research as means to enhance student engagement in sustainability, whether through similar NSF REU sites or other opportunities.",University at Buffalo,1306,University of Nebraska - Lincoln,3610,University of South Dakota,2548,,,,,,,,,Research,Coordination & Planning,,,,undergraduate research,10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,John Atkinson,Assistant Professor,University at Buffalo,1306,John Sangster,Assistant Professor,University of Nebraska - Lincoln,3610,Meghann Jarchow,Assistant Professor and Sustainability Program Coordinator,University of South Dakota,2548,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sustaining Ourselves - A Collaborative Mini-Retreat for Sustainability Professionals,"Join sustainability professionals across Minnesota in discovering how a model of stepping away from our various institutions, discovering common challenges and building cross-institution relationships helps us sustain ourselves. The planning team from the 4th annual Sustaining Ourselves Retreat will share their model for a retreat away from campus life that renews us for the work we do in sustainability. During this half-day workshop, we will lead a couple short sessions from the retreat format that we have found to be most helpful. The flexible framework that has been developed across our institutions and varied levels of experience in the field includes both structured and unstructured conversations on topics of sharing our own narratives, reflecting on common values, avoiding burn-out and connecting on innovative approaches to sustainability challenges. The approach used to support others and ourselves will be available to participants to incorporate either in their own campuses or in cross-institution gatherings.

Barriers and Breakthroughs On the Road to Large-Scale Renewable Energy PPAs,"Conventional power prices are at historic lows. Yet, wind and solar power costs are still able to compete with 'brown' power. A new renewable energy trends report by the University of New Hampshire shows that campuses are rapidly embracing both onsite solar as well as large-scale offsite renewable energy power purchase agreements. Purchased electricity is typically the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions for campuses -- addressing these emissions is required to achieve GHG goals. Renewable energy, paired with efficiency and conservation efforts, is the only way to achieve sizable GHG reductions. But the road to large-scale renewables is long and full of potholes. Learn from two campuses that have learned to navigate the roadblocks to sourcing renewable energy, controlling energy costs, and nailing their climate goals. Learning Objectives: 1: Understand national renewable energy trends in the higher education sector. 2: Learn the financial, environmental, and educational benefits of renewable energy. 3: Gain the technical know-how of large scale PPAs from two campuses pursuing this strategy.",Edison Energy,8202,Boston University,2246,University of Richmond,2869,,,,,,,,,Energy,,,,,"renewable energy,large-scale renewable energy procurement,power purchase agreements",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Christopher O'Brien,Director of Higher Education Programs; Adjunct Faculty,Edison Energy,8202,Dennis Carlberg,Sustainability Director,Boston University,2246,Rob Andrejewski,Director of Sustainability,University of Richmond,2869,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_OBrien_2211.pdf,,,
Connecting Community Partnerships with Curriculum to Strengthen Sustainability Education,"This session will discuss the role of community partnerships (CP) for strengthening sustainability education at the University of St. Thomas (UST), a liberal arts university, and Virginia Tech (VT), a large land-grant institution. The first presentation, 'The Sustainable Communities Partnership: Leveraging University Strategic Goals to Catalyze Curricular Sustainability Initiatives,' will explore how UST integrates applied research with CPs into courses across disciplines to advance city sustainability goals and UST's strategic priorities of interdisciplinary inquiry and problem solving. The second presentation, 'Community Partnerships with Civic Agriculture and Food Systems Curriculum: Thriving and Advancing Learning Via Capstone Projects,' will highlight how the VT interdisciplinary, experiential-based curriculum, civic agriculture and food systems, partners students with community-based organizations to build capacity for a culminating capstone project that addresses a real-time agrifood issue. We plan to engage the audience in an interactive discussion that addresses the unique challenges of CP work, including strategies for maintaining purposeful CPs and the programmatic differences and similarities within two academic institutions.

Sustainability and the Capstone Experience: Lessons from 5 Years of Applied Sustainability at Southwestern University,"For the past five years, the Southwestern environmental studies capstone experience has allowed students to engage with salient social, economic, and environmental sustainability issues on their campus. Each year, environmental studies seniors propose a project, conduct background research, and collaborate with various stakeholders on campus to achieve their goals. This program allows students to apply the knowledge learned in the classroom and gain hands-on experience with sustainability initiatives that make a positive impact on the campus community. Examples of past projects include modernizing campus infrastructure, establishing a student green fund, promoting sustainability engagement and environmental justice, and developing a land management plan for the campus ecological laboratory. In this presentation, faculty and students will co-present on the course curricular structure, the importance of stakeholder engagement, the difficulty of overcoming unexpected challenges, and the nuances of working with university administration.

Reuse or Build New? A Tale of Two Carbon Footprints,"What role does embodied and operational carbon play in making campus development decisions? What role do offsets have in balancing the equation? In light of the ever-growing stock of buildings and atmospheric carbon, institutions are taking leadership roles via their new campus construction projects, and thinking twice about the value of their existing buildings. While operational metrics are increasingly available, environmental impacts inherent in construction and material production (embodied impacts) have been difficult to quantify for decision-making. Improved tools now provide life cycle analyses that allow campuses and architects to look holistically at these embodied impacts. With complete and comparable information about the energy inherent in both existing buildings, and new construction projects, more ecologically informed decisions can be made. Campuses are well positioned to show environmental leadership in this process. In this session, Todd Holland presents such decision-making at Hampshire College. Todd played a leadership role in a new building slated to meet the Living Building Challenge. Christopher Nielson and George Gard will present the life cycle analysis for the Living Building project and a former mill building to illustrate how these metrics are being used in environmental strategic planning.",Bruner/Cott Architects,7100,Hampshire College,3276,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Air & Climate,,,,"carbon footprint,reuse,existing buildings,living buildings,construction",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Christopher Nielson,Architect,Bruner/Cott Architects,7100,George Gard,Architect,Bruner/Cott Architects,7100,Todd Holland,Projects and Operations Manager,Hampshire College,3276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tackling the Supply Chain-Proven Strategies to Source More Sustainable Food,"Colleges and universities play an important role supporting the development of sustainable food systems. Historically, sustainable dining programs have focused on sourcing local and organic produce. Increasingly universities are playing a role transforming how animals are raised for food, building momentum for a shift away from factory farming toward more humane methods. For example, universities played a critical role in the national movement to adopt cage free eggs. During this session speakers will discuss strategies for sourcing more humane animal products and integrating animal friendly practices into their dining services. Speakers will discuss procurement policies, best practices for writing RFPs, creative menu design, and effective methods to reduce the overall use of animal products. Speakers will also discuss barriers to integrating sustainable animal products, including the challenge of understanding animal welfare issues and certifications, identifying sustainable suppliers, and managing the cost differences of higher-welfare products. The panel will focus on resources and strategies that helped them overcome those barriers. The speakers will also relate efforts to improve animal welfare to sustainability reporting programs like AASHE STARS and the Real Food Challenge. The session will explore in depth how Cal Dining, UCSB, and Occidental College have overcome barriers to create holistic, cost effective solutions that support sustainable animal agriculture.",Farm Forward,7604,"University of California, Santa Barbara",4169,Sodexo,3600,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,,"animal welfare,supply chains,product sourcing",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Andrew deCoriolis,Director of Policy,Farm Forward,7604,Audrey Horn,Global Food Initiative Felllow,"University of California, Santa Barbara",4169,Annie Rowell,Vermont First Coordinator,Sodexo,3600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Horn_2254.pptx,0915_deCoriolis_2254.pdf,,
Creating a Space for Collaboration and Cohort Building through Community Based Student Work Experiences,"Furman University has a very strong Student Sustainability Fellowship Program through the David E. Shi Center for Sustainability. This program provides students with project-focused, sustainability related work experiences at a wide range of government offices and non-profit community organizations and businesses throughout the local and regional area. Since the program's inception in 2008, the center has funded and hosted more than 230 individual Student Fellowships during the summer and the academic year and continually worked to improve the program through participant feedback. In 2017, we piloted a new cohort model for our fellowships to bring students more education surrounding sustainability and give them a group of peers to develop relationships and learn together through weekly joint programming. This is an important facet as the students spend summer fellowships with community organizations and have historically not had ways to come together to share and learn from each other's experiences.

Engaging Students and Community: Creating Safe Spaces through Community Sensitivity Training Programs,"Furman University and the David E. Shi Center for Sustainability work to create a student experience that promotes real world student learning experiences and meets community needs. In order to fulfill this aim, we send students out into the community to work with local community members and organizations on projects that address real and perceived needs within our community. This action leads to unparalleled experiences for our students and benefits our community by working towards assessment of and solutions to current germane challenges. When engaging with communities in need, training students before sending them out to work directly with community partners is of paramount importance. This step reduces incidents of student error, bolsters the town-gown relationship, and produces better outcomes for the students and community partners. Furman University has developed and implemented a student training program that addresses how students can 1) define their role and the university's role as they work with community partners, 2) develop empathy for peoples from diverse backgrounds and life histories, and 3) comply with regulations ethically as they conduct their research. We have developed training modules to address each of these topic areas and will share our module content, implementation programs and lessons learned after the 2016 launch of this program.",Furman University,3836,,,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,"students,community engagement",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Kelly Grant Purvis,Associate Director of Sustainability Programs,Furman University,3836,Weston Dripps,Executive Director,Furman University,3836,Laura Bain,Associate Director of Sustainability Assessment,Furman University,3836,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Purvis_2362.pdf,,,
Carbon Pricing in Higher Education: Panel with 3 Models for Internal Carbon Pricing and Engaging in National Leadership,"Learn about what models other colleges are using to inform your own carbon pricing design and implementation strategy! At our panel discussion, we will discuss the systems that Vassar, Swarthmore and Yale are using to price carbon, covering Vassar's and Swarthmore's shadow price for construction projects, Swarthmore's charge on departmental emissions, and Yale's experimental models for revenue-neutral carbon pricing and national role in the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition. We will discuss the process that each of us went through to develop a proposal, create buy-in, and ultimately get approval to establish our carbon pricing systems. Each of these schools is now well into its second or third year, so we will cover lessons learned along the way. We will also share how the Presidents of Vassar and Swarthmore partnered with three other college leaders to become public advocates for a national price on carbon. We will cover how this work has generated excitement and buy-in for climate protection across a broad array of campus stakeholders, helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions, affected campus decision making, created new staff positions, and inspired increased community engagement.",Swarthmore College,3879,Yale University,3678,,,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,carbon pricing,10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Aurora Winslade,Director of Sustainability,Swarthmore College,3879,Casey Pickett,Director of the Carbon Charge,Yale University,3678,Nathaniel Graf,,Swarthmore College,3879,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Graf_2539.pptx,,,
EcoExchangeEdu: Promoting Inter-Campus Collaboration to Strengthen the Culture of Sustainability in South Texas,"EcoExchangeEdu (EEE) is a group of students, staff, faculty, and administrators from South Texas colleges and universities united by a shared commitment to sustainability. Established in 2014, EEE has been organizing annual showcases since 2015 designed to give area students the opportunity to 'exchange' ideas and creative work related to sustainability. Three EEE members (a student, a staff person, and a faculty member, each representing different academic institutions) provide a brief history of the group's formation and suggest a model for similar collaborations between academic institutions in other regions. The presenters will also share examples of presentations made at past Showcases, with an emphasis on the variety of submission types (presentations, posters, hands-on activities, art displays, public service announcements, and food exhibits). The presentation concludes with an argument for the value of inter-campus collaboration as an alternative to competitive approaches (such as RecycleMania) for engaging campus communities about sustainability. EcoExchangeEdu represents a model for reducing the isolation of campus sustainability advocates.

The planning process relied heavily on input from both internal and external stakeholders. The planning process was so inclusive and successful, that administration within VCU is now replicating the same methodology for their master planning process. While implementing the plan has been successful, the difficulty lies in measuring success and updating the plan, simultaneously. Portland Community College is in the process of developing the college's first-ever Sustainability Plan as part of a broader college Facilities Master Plan. Working with consultants and a small task force, with feedback from multiple governance structures and the broader college community, the college is nearing completion an all-encompassing Sustainability Plan. Balancing priorities as well as goals that are both aspirational and achievable have been challenging, but securing buy-in remained a high priority, resulting in a more valuable final product. Likewise, the University of Virginia undertook a year-long collaborative process via committees, working groups, and task forces, to develop its Sustainability Plan before launching in spring of 2016. Implementation of the plan across a large university requires coordination and continual buy-in from current and new stakeholders as aspects of the plan are implemented and refined. Challenges include enabling and empowering others to hold accountability for portions of",Portland Community College,2505,Virginia Commonwealth University,1546,University of Virginia,4028,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"planning,sustainability plans,master plans",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Briar Schoon,Sustainability Manager,Portland Community College,2505,Erin Stanforth,Director of Sustainability,Virginia Commonwealth University,1546,Nina Morris,Outreach & Engagement Program Manager,University of Virginia,4028,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Stanforth.pptx,,,
Faculty Learning Communities for Sustainability,"In this session, State University of New York at New Paltz (SUNY NP) and Oregon State University (OSU) will share their unique sustainability learning community designs as well as successes and challenges related to creating and implementing Faculty Learning Communities for Sustainability in two unique contexts: with tenure track Faculty Fellows (SUNY NP) and with land grant Extension Agents (OSU). Both initiatives are aimed at creating a network of educators (faculty, staff, extension agents) across a broad range of contexts (disciplines, departments, regions) to focus on the integration of sustainability in their work while providing support for these efforts. Both initiatives envision the ultimate purpose as being the foundation of growing a knowledge network related to sustainability and resilience issues. Presenters will discuss some of the biggest issues of learning community participation, such as faculty time, perception, and what is in it for them. A learning community design tool (developed by OSU Center for Teaching and Learning) will be shared to help participants think through the design of their faculty learning community for sustainability.",State University of New York at New Paltz,1333,Oregon State University,4044,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,"faculty learning communities,faculty",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Will Hong,Assistant Professor of Digital Media Production,State University of New York at New Paltz,1333,Ann Scheerer,,Oregon State University,4044,Kay Sagmiller,"Director, Center for Teaching & Learning",Oregon State University,4044,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045_Scheerer.pdf,1045_Hong.pdf,,
"Refillable water bottles, reusable bags, and bicycle lights: Is sustainability swag sustainable?","When students arrive on your campus, perhaps they find a refillable water bottle in their residence hall room. Or at new student orientation, perhaps they receive a reusable bag with the college or university logo. Or while attending an out-door adventure program, perhaps they receive a bike light to students to entice them to join. Giveaways can help reach a broad audience. But giving out stuff - even the 'right stuff' - may not spread the type of sustainability messages we intend. This symposium brings together those who share an interest in: (1) the intended goals of sustainability swag, (2) ways of thinking about the sustainability of these items, including life cycle assessments and carbon footprints, and (3) the outcomes, intended or unintended of swag. One of our campus give-aways in the residence halls, a resusable plastic water bottle with the message 'Rehydrate, Refill, and Reduce Waste' is used as an example.",University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Waste,Purchasing,,,"waste reduction,campus culture",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Sam Grindel,,University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,Catherine Middlecamp,Professor,University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,Tim Lindstrom,Graduate Student,University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045_Lindstrom_2445.pptx,,,
Developing Carbon Credits on Your Campus through the Voluntary Carbon Market,"For the past year, a handful of schools have been third party verifying and selling carbon credits on the Voluntary Carbon Market through Second Nature's Carbon Credit and Purchasing Program. The carbon sales allow schools to access capital that they invest in further energy reduction projects on campus. This helps schools achieve deeper emissions reductions and move closer to their targets of carbon neutrality. This session will focus on opportunities to develop on-campus credits through the Verified Carbon Standard methodology Campus Clean Energy & Energy Efficiency. We will discuss the process of developing a project, third party validation and verification, and demonstrating additionality. This methodology covers credits from Scope 1 stationary emissions and Scope 2 electricity-based emissions. Participants will learn how to determine whether or not their school may be eligible to develop credits following this program. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee is currently in the process of developing a new project following this methodology. We will discuss lessons learned during this process, and hear about the experience of validating a new project to the Verified Carbon Standard.",Second Nature,0123,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,4059,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Air & Climate,Investment & Finance,,,"carbon offsets,carbon market",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Ruby Woodside,Innovative Services Manager,Second Nature,0123,Kate Nelson,Chief Sustainability Officer,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,4059,John Gardner,Sustainability Policy & Planning Analyst,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,4059,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Woodside_2255.pdf,,,
Expanding the Horizons of Campus Recycling: Addressing Expanded Polystyrene Waste at Three Institutions of Higher Education,"College and university campuses strive to minimize waste and promote thoughtful disposal practices among campus residents. However, one material that presents unique challenges to sustainably manage is expanded polystyrene (EPS), a plastic often referred to as Styrofoam. Valued for its structural and insulating properties, EPS is used in shipping containers for sensitive products in research labs. These properties become problematic once on campus, as the material cannot be included among plastics in recycling programs. Thus, EPS containers often are sent to landfill after a single use, to the consternation of laboratory staff and campus services employees. However, institutions of higher education can serve as proving grounds for novel waste management initiatives. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, students and staff have partnered with local actors to develop an EPS recycling program, successfully diverting EPS from landfill and extending its useful life. Moreover, multi-campus collaboration has produced sister programs at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Washington University in St. Louis. This session will feature presentations from these institutions that highlight the features of each program, including success stories, stumbling blocks, and economic and environmental considerations. Discussion will focus on lessons, ideas, and applications for institutions interested in mitigating EPS waste through approaches that employ the circular economy.",University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,Washington University in St. Louis,5993,"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign",4308,,,,,,,,,Waste,Buildings,,,,"styrofoam,labs",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Tim Lindstrom,Graduate Student,University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,Cassandra Hage,Sustainability Manager,Washington University in St. Louis,5993,Marco Tjioe,Research Assistant,"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign",4308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Lindstrom_2148.pptx,,,
Development of a Sustainability Culture Assessment to Inform Planning,"Higher education institutions commonly refer to 'a culture of sustainability'; however, until very recently, few institutions have assessed the sustainability culture of the campus community. Instrument development work is nascent but is receiving increased attention due in part to a few notable pioneering efforts and addition of a 'credit' in the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS) version 2.1 for a cultural assessment focused on sustainability values, behaviors, and beliefs (and possibly awareness). This presentation discusses development and pilot testing of an assessment designed to provide insight into the sustainability-related initiatives of a large public university. An important objective of the assessment was that the results inform planning and lead to improvement. This presentation will discuss identification of indicators from the organizational culture, psychology, and higher education sustainability literature. These indicators included signs and symbols, observed behaviors, practiced behaviors, values, and cognition. We will conclude with a discussion of how the results are informing the campus sustainability office's efforts.",James Madison University,4345,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,"campus culture,assessment",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Debbie Sturm,Associate Professor,James Madison University,4345,Rob Alexander,Associate Professor,James Madison University,4345,Christie-Joy Hartman,"Executive Director, Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability",James Madison University,4345,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cultivating Student Sustainability Leadership,"How does one lead in a way that is inclusive, equitable and ecologically conscious? Can we become leaders who seek to empower change agents and inspire a value shift through community building, all while leaving room for expression? These are questions the Institute on the Environment's Undergraduate Leaders are striving to answer. Through this session we want to share with you the ways perspectives can be reconstructed to identify assumptions and enlarge concepts of place, relationship and expression. These values can be expanded to include our colonial worldviews based on settlement and to imagine our views from a different starting point: connection, reciprocity and responsibility to Place. SC: Through this interactive session, attendees will explore the emerging concept of sustainable leadership. Attendees will develop an understanding of this leadership style and will be given opportunities to assess their sustainable leadership through activities.

AASHE STARS as a Framework for Sustainability Master Planning: Purdue University,"Alignment and integration are two of the key concepts driving Purdue University Office of Campus Master Planning and Sustainability's effort to develop a five year Sustainability Plan for Purdue Physical Facilities. The development of the Plan has prioritized the alignment of disparate university activities, initiatives, and data collection efforts to bring a clearer voice to our current and on-going sustainability progress. One of our first decisions was to leverage the University's familiarity with the AASHE STARS program and align the development of the Plan goals with STARS metrics. This way data collection efforts to satisfy periodic reporting required by the Plan will be integrated with STARS reporting, avoiding a duplication of data collection and reporting effort. Additionally, alignment with STARS allows our team to point to widely accepted best practices when advocating for new or different data collecting efforts or calculation of KPIs. Finally, alignment and integration with STARS will create a more durable Sustainability Plan. It allows our team to show the 'light at the end of the tunnel' when advocating for continuous improvement efforts to meet targets for metrics like greenhouse gas emissions or potable water consumption during implementation. We see STARS becoming a key leverage point when building the business case for sustainable capital improvements, where the Sustainability Plan, STARS reporting and Purdue's fiscal cycle are all intentionally aligned.",Purdue University,4793,Heapy Engineering,6181,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,"STARS,sustainability plans,master plans",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Michael Gulich,Director of Campus Master Planning and Sustainability,Purdue University,4793,Michael Berning,Senior Principal,Heapy Engineering,6181,Max Driscoll,Assistant Director of Sustainability,Purdue University,4793,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These plans supported various campus districts, but where the plan boundaries met campus became fragmented - design and performance guidelines created great districts, but did not necessarily add up to an equitable, sustainable campus. Concurrently, Texas A&M developed a number of special interest planning documents, among them a sustainability master plan and a bicycle master plan. Many other changes also occurred simultaneously including Texas A&M's use of AASHE's STARS for sustainability reporting, growing efforts around diversity, equity, and inclusion, and the upgrade of on-campus co-generation facilities. Great strides were being taken by many departments on campus, but were not taking advantage of the synergies that could result if coordinated under a single umbrella. Under the master plan update, Ayers Saint Gross and Texas A&M worked to identify an integrated approach to sustainability with both a dedicated chapter as well as high-performance content in each of the other subject areas of the plan. The master plan update addresses both operational and non-operational concerns and will help transform Texas A&M into a more sustainable campus. The decision-making framework included in the plan will support inclusion to ensure the contributions of all university departments provide measurable progress towards a focused vision of sustainability at Texas A&M.",Ayers Saint Gross,0424,Texas A&M University,7982,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,"master plans,STARS",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Allison Wilson,Sustainability Director,Ayers Saint Gross,0424,Lilia Gonzales,University Architect,Texas A&M University,7982,Kelly Wellman,Sustainability Director,Texas A&M University,7982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Wilson_2014.pdf,,,
Best Practices for Minimizing Waste on College and University Campuses,"With institutions scoring an average score of 1 point in waste reduction and diversion, there is tremendous room for improvement and institutions across the country are looking for ways to improve their programs and as a result, increase scores. Getting to zero-waste can be achieved by developing a multi-year waste diversion plan that is comprehensive of typical and non-typical waste items and is engaging across the campus. Additionally, success depends on innovation around waste programs including an entrepreneurial approach from students to designing programs around non-typical items that don't have existing productive recycling outlets. Commodity recycling has helped college campuses around the country divert 70%-80% of their waste from landfills. The remaining waste must be addressed tactically and systemically in order to avoid a diminishing rate of return. Johnson County Community College has near perfect AASHE scores in many of its 'campus engagement' categories and will be able to provide guidance on how colleges and universities can create and implement campus wide programs by leveraging student engagement to help find viable solutions. During this panel discussion moderated by Ken Purdue, National Manager of Sustainability-West, Staples, attendees will hear industry perspectives from Dr. Janet Hale and Magdalena Erickson of Texas State, Kristal Anton of Johnson County Community College, and ERI on how to innovate in waste diversion.",Johnson County Community College,2128,Staples Advantage,6407,"Texas State University, San Marcos",8001,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,waste minimization,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Michael Rea,,Johnson County Community College,2128,Ken Perdue,National Manager of Sustainability-Central/West,Staples Advantage,6407,Janet Hale,Attorney,"Texas State University, San Marcos",8001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lead your school to carbon neutrality and 100% renewable energy.,"The Climate Leadership Network comprises more than 600 colleges and universities in every state and the District of Columbia who have committed to take action on climate and prepare students through research and education to solve the challenges of the 21st century. Students can serve as resources to ensure that their institution not only fulfills its Commitment, but also utilizes it as a practical educational opportunity. This workshop will empower students with tools to advocate to and partner with administrative leadership to push for climate action on their campus. In this session we will briefly introduce the three Climate Leadership Commitments; Carbon, Climate, & Resilience. Students will have time to see if their school has signed one of the commitments, and learn how to view data and assess progress through Second Nature's Reporting Platform. We will also discuss Environment America's campaign to move colleges and universities to 100% renewable energy, and how students can get involved. Students will learn practical tools to further help their institution fulfill climate goals. At the 2016 AASHE Conference, Second Nature and National Campus Leadership Council presented at the Student Summit, and found that many students were interested in knowing whether or not their school had signed one of the Commitments, and how their institution was meeting Commitment goals.",Second Nature,0123,Environment America,8302,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,Air & Climate,,,climate commitments,10/15/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Stephen Ellis,Climate Programs Manager,Second Nature,0123,Ruby Woodside,Innovative Services Manager,Second Nature,0123,Bronte Payne,Clean Energy Advocate,Environment America,8302,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1300_Ellis_2245.pptx,,,
We Are Still In! Using the STAR Community Rating Framework to Strengthen Your Community Outreach Efforts on Climate and Sustainability,"Campuses and communities across the country have publicly declared, 'We Are Still In', confirming their support for the Paris Climate Agreement. Campuses and communities are also looking for ways to measure and improve sustainability. This session seeks to inform the audience about the overlapping nature of the STAR Community Rating System for local government and AASHE's STARS program for colleges and universities. By understanding the shared goals of the two rating systems, shared opportunities around climate and sustainability can be identified and pursued. The presenters will share examples of how faculty can use STAR as a tool to guide student engagement with local communities, improve community sustainability outcomes, and educate the next generation of sustainability leaders. Many of the sustainability challenges facing communities can be addressed through partnership with local campuses. Whether it's a campus working to reduce its own carbon emissions as part of a larger community reduction goal or recognizing the strain the off-campus student housing puts on community-wide affordable housing, there are many opportunities for engagement. STAR includes measurable outcomes that can help campuses assess the impact of their sustainability outreach. Panelists will give examples of community projects addressing energy, water, waste & more. Participants will have an opportunity to map their community outreach projects onto the STAR Framework and 21 Leading Indicators.",Pennsylvania State University,4190,STAR Communities,8303,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,"Paris Climate Agreement,international,assessment",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Michele Halsell,"Director, Sustainable Communities Collaborative",Pennsylvania State University,4190,Ann Quinn,Director of Greener Behrend,Pennsylvania State University,4190,Kristi Wamstad-Evans,Technical Director,STAR Communities,8303,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1130_Halsell_2700.pdf,,,
Beyond Policy: Sustainable Catering at an Institutional Level,"How many sustainable catering policies, goals, and guidelines are hard-fought and won, but face the challenge of ubiquitous adoption across the institution? Goals for landfill diversion, waste reduction, and sustainable food procurement are propelled by the commitment of internal food service providers, but what about the catering orders from off campus? How can a decentralized university event planning and catering culture make sustainable catering the default choice? To address these issues, this university collaborated with its contracted catering management company to develop a strategy for applying minimum zero landfill waste catering requirements and recognizing caterers that offer sustainable and local food menu items, with particular attention to defining metrics, data collection and reporting. The online catering ordering platform communicates the university's sustainability goals, places icons next to caterers that support these goals, and allows customers to filter for caterers designated with a sustainability icon. In this presentation, participants will hear the detailed program and process for implementation, and results for how the program influenced the participation level of the caterers serving the university, the number of sustainable events planned, and the degree to which users increase their utilization of sustainable caterers.",Emory University,3931,America to Go,8304,,,,,,,,,,,Purchasing,Food & Dining,,,Dining Services,"policies,catering",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Kelly Weisinger,,Emory University,3931,Wade Sanner,"Associate Director, Procurement Services",Emory University,3931,Rob Lebowitz,Chief Operating Officer,America to Go,8304,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Weisinger_2854.pdf,,,
"Art, Science, Ways of Knowing and Agency in Place: Backyard Phenology as a Tool","We are inspired by a successful art-science collaboration featuring an adorable silver camper (the 'Climate Chaser') serving as a tiny natural history museum and recording studio to capture stories of changing seasons and cycles of nature. The presenting team draws on the integrated nature of this new, Minnesota-based citizen-science project, Backyard Phenology: Tracking Nature's Cycles in a Changing Climate, to demonstrate how art, science, and place-based observations can be mobilized to catalyze awareness of and action on climate change and adaptation. We will facilitate a creation session and also have an opportunity for discussion on community engagement, educational outreach, audio recording, and art-science fusions. In our framing of sustainability, we use phenology--the study of seasonal changes in the life of plants and animals, such as flowering, budburst, emergence of insects and migration of birds, especially in relation to climate change--as a tool and method to bring people together towards community adaptation and capacity building through the observation of place and local knowledge. The solution becomes one of ethics, creative inquiry, civic engagement, and transformative action. We approach these challenges through the intersection of science, arts, and community action. How can we use creative inquiry to move beyond data or disciplinary silos to tell a new story about place and solutions within place?

How a New Learning Lab Becomes a Continuous Career Fair and Sustainability Jobs Hub,"The Sacramento City College Mechanical Electrical Technology (MET) Program has been in place for decades. In recent years, enrollment has leveled off but local industry still has a relative high demand for jobs that SCC/MET provides graduates can fill. SCC/MET collaborated with their HVAC business partner to solve a mutual problem by developing a program that helps ensure that SCC/MET are enthusiastically engaged in and academically prepared to help ensure continued building performance for the community's facilities by readying graduates to serve as professionals in energy-related fields. This presentation will explore how a learning lab successfully transformed into commercial training center. It will highlight how this 'duel use' facility combined with the latest training systems created the synergy that is now developing careers in energy conservation, industry engagement and community outreach. Note; HVAC graduates are needed: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects a 14 percent job growth rate from 2014-2024 for HVAC technicians (installation and maintenance workers), a much faster than average growth rate. For the state of California, the demand is expected to be even greater.

To do this, they will draw on their campus experience to help re-generate, re-new and re-fresh America. Our task is to provide the tools, skills, and knowledge to equip these future leaders and change agents. This networking workshop will focus on questions like: What are we doing to prepare them for this responsibility? What more can we do? The intention is to look at the culture in our institutions. We'll consider 'Is my institution providing not only the the educational opportunities (courses) but, as importantly, an integrated and consistent experience. Assuming institutional culture is strategy in action and, acknowledging that we create the culture that defines the environment, we too must accept our responsibility and be agents of change. This is an an integral and powerful part of the process of cultural definition that will support and prepare our students. More questions include: What culture are we modeling? Are we and is our institution actively and engaged in the process of modeling good stewardship through actions, communication, and education? How can we improve?

Gompei's Gears: Implementing and Sustaining a Free Campus Bike-sharing Program,"Even with hilly terrain and long winters, bicycling is popular in Worcester, Massachusetts, and in particular among the many college students. At WPI in 2014 a student group researched transportation alternatives and recommended a community bike share program. In 2015, another student group further developed the bike share option by conducting surveys of the community population and transportation trends, investigating commercial bike share companies and their bicycles, and evaluating existing bike share programs at other universities. This team concluded with a set of recommendations and a detailed implementation plan. Over the next year, the student sustainability club (called the Green Team) and the Office of Sustainability used this project as a guide to plan the implementation of the bike share program. In April 2016, the Gompei's Gears Bike share Program was launched, providing WPI's students, faculty, and staff with free access to bicycles. The program has been quite successful, with over 1200 check-outs in the first two months of operation. Now, nearly a year later, we can see that this program has been widely embraced by the campus community and has been recognized by local and state groups as an example of sound research and good planning in alternative transportation. We have also learned some lessons in running a successful program that we will be happy to share.",Worcester Polytechnic Institute,0194,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,"bike share,bikes",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,John Orr,Director of Sustainability,Worcester Polytechnic Institute,0194,Elizabeth Tomaszewski,Associate Director of Sustainability,Worcester Polytechnic Institute,0194,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Orr_2341.pdf,,,
Best Practices Incorporating Sustainability into the Curricula/ Dallas County Community College District,"The 7 colleges that are part of the Dallas County Community College District (DCCCD) signed the ACUPCC/ Second Nature President's Climate Commitment and have set dates for carbon neutrality. Since they signed beginning in 2006, these colleges have been working on mechanisms on how to incorporate sustainability into the curricula. At the DCCCD we have developed different modalities of including sustainability principles in the curricula. Several of the DCCCD colleges award their graduates with 'Green Cords' to highlight their training and commitment to sustainability. The questions then become: How can the faculty and administrators of higher education promote the incorporation of sustainability principles into the curricula? What experiences and best practices exist on this topic? This session will share what has been done at some of the colleges of the DCCCD. The presentation will describe the process of how to involve and train faculty of all disciplines to incorporate sustainability principles in their curricula.

Using Contemplative Practices to Cultivate Resilient Students and Social-Ecological Systems,"This joint session will offer two presentations on the uses of contemplative practices and mindfulness-based pedagogy for teaching about environmental sustainability. Topic 1 (Goralnik): If sustainability is the effort to meet 'human needs in a socially just manner without depriving ecosystems of their health,' then ethics and action are central to the project. Three pedagogies provide insight into how we might educate students to do this work. Contemplative practices provide tools for resiliency in the face of a degraded planet. Community building facilitates the empathy and relationship-building that make collaborative work possible and rewarding. Integration refers both to a deeply interdisciplinary curriculum, as well as whole student -- body, mind, spirit -- learning. This presentation will discuss the use of these pedagogies to educate for sustainability wisdom and action. Topic 2 (Marcus): Human and non-human communities have varying capacities to respond to disturbance while maintaining the same basic functions. That is the main argument behind resilience theory and practice, which seek to describe and, in some cases, manage this aspect of complex systems. Mindfulness-based classroom practices can help to illuminate component concepts such as systems thinking, dynamic equilibrium, and adaptive cycles which can then be applied across disciplines, and across scales of time and space.","University of North Carolina, Asheville",4237,Michigan State University,0439,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Research,,,,"pedagogy,mindfulness",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Sonia Marcus,Director of Sustainability,"University of North Carolina, Asheville",4237,Lissy Goralnik,"Assistant Professor, Community Sustainability",Michigan State University,0439,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sustainability for Sustainability Professionals,"Successful implementation of a university's strategic plan for sustainability depends upon careful prioritization and time management. All institutions want to address a broad range of operational and academic opportunities related to climate action, energy, water, waste, transportation, food, green buildings, procurement, equity, green space, and cross-cutting research and teaching opportunities. Working effectively in all of these and other areas with limited staff and time resources presents challenges to the sustainability of our programs and our professional careers. This session presents two methods of setting priorities and influencing outcomes that advance progress towards sustainable practices, while respecting the health and well-being of those tasked with implementation. Wake Forest will present a model that they have refined over the years, including a framework based on Allan R. Cohen and David L. Bradford's 'Influence Without Authority.'

Effects on Associate Faculty Engagement through Initiating PLCs,"Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) are created when groups of teaching professionals meet to achieve together what they cannot achieve individually. However, in our ever changing educational environment, we must consider how we can sustain PLCs in an online format in a manner that still works toward the main goals of a PLC, which is to work collaboratively in cycles of inquiry and research in order to: 1. Improve and renew the commitment to teaching and learning 2. Build on shared knowledge 3. Build capacity in students and instructors. Organizing this professional learning community within a brick and mortar building presents its own challenges, but adding the component of online or hybrid PLCs compounds the challenges of team building, trust and collaboration, and exploiting the expertise of our group members. The purposes of this research are 1 ) to understand if a PLC format in the College of Education will impact the production, contribution, and sense of belong of the COE Associate Faculty (Adjunct Faculty/AF) and 2) to examine if this will translate into greater engagement by AF within the course(s) they are instructing.

Sustainability across the Life Cycle of Higher Education Facilities: Nationwide Trends & Practical Tools for Improvement,"We will highlight key findings from the second annual 'State of Sustainability' report from Sightlines and University of New Hampshire. This report examines publically available data across each stage of the building life-cycle. Key Findings: Normalized energy consumption is down 8% and related emissions 14% since 2007. Current best practice in emissions reporting omits sources across several phases of the building life-cycle, missing as much as 37% of the emissions profile. Construction: Formal sustainability policies governing new construction are popular, with LEED a significant driver. Operations: The majority of STARS reporters lack formal sustainable operations & maintenance policies.

A New Tool for Campus Carbon and Nitrogen Footprints: Perspectives from Users,"A new online tool for calculating and managing both campus carbon and nitrogen footprints has been created by combining the Campus Carbon Calculator tool and the Nitrogen Footprint Tool for Institutions. The combined functionality of calculating multiple environmental footprint metrics will enable higher education institutions to streamline data entry and analysis and gain a broad perspective of impacts. This talk will present case studies of institutions that have calculated both campus carbon and nitrogen footprints, and institutions that have used the combined carbon and nitrogen footprint tool. Institutions that are part of the Nitrogen Footprint Tool Network and others that will have taken part in a beta-testing phase of the combined tool will contribute feedback that will be used in this presentation, answering questions such as: What level of effort is needed to use the combined carbon and nitrogen footprint tool? How do the results contribute to campus sustainability efforts? And how can the tool be used to set campus sustainability goals? A combined assessment of campus carbon and nitrogen footprints has several advantages beyond calculating these metrics separately: 1) it gives a broader picture of environmental impacts on local and global scales than either metric alone; 2) footprint reduction strategies are often beneficial for both types of footprints; and 3) the unified tool allows for reduced time spent on data entry and analysis.",University of Virginia,4028,University of New Hampshire,0724,,,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,,,,"nitrogen footprint,nitrogen,carbon footprint",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Elizabeth Castner,Nitrogen Footprint Project Manager,University of Virginia,4028,Allison Leach,PhD Candidate,University of New Hampshire,0724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Growth of Renewable Energy in Higher Education: Can It Get Us to Our GHG Goals?,"Is higher ed on track to achieve its GHG reduction targets? Not without massively ramping up renewables. A new study by the University of New Hampshire and Altenex compiles and analyzes all the known renewable energy purchases in the higher ed sector. Considered along-side a previously issued UNH report, the good news is that campuses are making some progress reducing electricity emissions through efficiency and conservation, as well as a quickly growing number of onsite solar installations. But, collectively, these efforts are far from achieving the reductions targeted in many public climate plans. However, one small but nascent trend shows promise - large-scale renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPSs). These long-term contracts from utility-scale renewable energy projects help schools reduce and control their energy costs, while taking long strides toward GHG goals. The authors of the UNH study will review the trends, highlighting strategies for successfully taking climate action while bounding over barriers along the way.",Edison Energy,8202,University of New Hampshire,0724,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Air & Climate,,,,"power purchase agreements,renewable energy",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Christopher O'Brien,Director of Higher Education Programs; Adjunct Faculty,Edison Energy,8202,Jennifer Andrews,Project Director,University of New Hampshire,0724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_OBrien_2213.pdf,,,
Tracking Campus Energy & Water Performance with ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager,"Keeping a university campus sustainable can start with tracking energy and water performance for a building. In this session, we will describe our experience with tracking building performance with an online tool provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA created ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager to measure buildings' electricity, gas and water metrics as well as calculate if the building is eligible for an ENERGY STAR score. UNC Charlotte is assessing the effort required to build its portfolio and obtain ratings for as many buildings as possible. Only the most common building types are eligible for ratings at this time, so some campus buildings are not scorable. This tool is most used in cities and states such as New York, California and Washington D.C. that have benchmarking policies. UNC Charlotte hopes to encourage the use of the tool as well as perpetuate the practice of sustainable energy management.","University of North Carolina, Charlotte",0725,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,,,,"Energy Star,benchmarking,metrics",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Isabel Srivoraphan,Sustainability Intern,"University of North Carolina, Charlotte",0725,Michael Lizotte,University Sustainability Officer,"University of North Carolina, Charlotte",0725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Srivoraphan_2958.pdf,,,

Engaging Students in Sustainability through High-Impact Teaching Practices: Two Case Studies,"This session (1) describes activities at diverse institutions to involve and instruct students in sustainability and (2) engages audience members in sharing experiences, identifying barriers to success, brainstorming solutions, and collaborating on best practices. At St. Joseph's College in Maine, community-based learning engages students in sustainability issues, fosters their moral understanding of environmental crisis, and develops transdisciplinary thinking necessary to solving environmental problems. Student projects have included assessing energy use in campus buildings, promoting energy-saving behavior, and developing a campus organic farm. Drawing on pre- and post-project assessments, Jeanne Gulnick presents St. Joseph's efforts as a case study and surveys best practices for engagement in sustainability. Scott Hicks's presentation focuses on a service-learning collaboration at the University of North Carolina, Pembroke, between the sustainability office and his environmental literature class. For the sustainability office, service-learning increased students' awareness of UNCP's sustainability commitment; for students, the project introduced collaborative sustainable design and targeted skills of communication, editing, and revision. Hicks's presentation discusses service-learning's efficacy in connecting institutional and academic sustainability efforts.

Oscar is grouchy for a reason! Campus recycling behavior research and action,Presents findings from phase one of a multi-phase study on recycling behavior at Colorado Mountain College. Findings are based on surveys of trash and recycling bin contents completed in spring 2017 and on surveys on recycling behavior administered to students. The bin content study includes four phases: 1) baseline survey of waste disposal as evidenced by contents of trash and recycling bins placed in their unaltered configuration in public areas; 2) survey of bin contents after removal of all unlabeled trash bins (leaving only bins labeled explicitly as 'trash' and 'recycling'); 3) survey of bin contents with only labeled containers available and an added sign near recycling bins detailing items that are recyclable (sign provided by recycling company); and 4) survey of bin contents with only labeled bins in place and the replacement of the recycling company sign with a sign designed by the researchers based on bin survey findings to date and literature on sign design and effectiveness. Student surveys include multiple choice and open answer questions designed to generate data on student knowledge about campus recycling and factors driving their level of participation in the recycling system. Responses to multiple choice questions will be analyzed quantitatively. Responses to open ended questions will be analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Findings will inform an educational intervention with new and continuing students in fall 2017.,Colorado Mountain College,0775,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Campus Engagement,Waste,,,"recycling,behavior change,waste audits,grounded theory",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Tina Evans,"Professor, Sustainability Studies",Colorado Mountain College,0775,Jessie Scherzer,Student,Colorado Mountain College,0775,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Evans_2524.pdf,,,
The High Touch Approach: Making Inclusivity and Social Sustainability Core to Mission,"A pressing issue facing university campuses is concern about social community. Dartmouth College and its peers is being held accountable for high-risk behavior and a lack of inclusivity. How can Sustainability Offices offer solutions? It is easy to identify our value add as providing opportunities for experiential learning, reducing operational costs, and supporting innovative research. Contributing to social community building and inclusivity efforts doesn't always make the list. Dartmouth Sustainability Office has made inclusivity and community-building work core to mission. Our approach begins with a set of tools & values that begin on the level of individual interactions between students & staff. The approach is high touch and mirrors the types of interactions students get in the student programs part of campus. This approach is critical to the implementation of our Inclusivity Action Plan, which touches all student programs and focuses on recruitment, storytelling, and assessment. The high touch approach draws in students from different backgrounds, supports them, and keeps them engaged. We are not experts on inclusivity and to be honest, this is at times challenging for our minimally diverse office. We hope this session offers tools for offices wanting to jump in to tackling this issue. In this session, we will define what a high touch approach is and outline what we do to align sustainability with this institutional strategic priority.",Dartmouth College,0788,,,,,,,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,,,,"inclusion,community",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Jenna Musco,Assistant Director,Dartmouth College,0788,Rosi Kerr,Sustainability Director,Dartmouth College,0788,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Promoting Sustainability Through Partnerships - A Collection of Case Studies,"Colorado State University has achieved some remarkable successes through a variety of partnerships across campus. These range in scale from a single researcher purchasing a piece of efficient lab equipment to an entire team working to develop a windrow composting operation. A few examples of projects involving partnerships across CSU: alternative transportation, grant applications (Athletics, Library, composting), efficient equipment/appliances in labs and breakrooms, and green labs. This session is designed to highlight how these partnerships were developed, what worked and what didn't, and how to nurture key stakeholders to build on successes. The session will include discussions on how other institutions can transfer these ideas to their own campuses. Learning Outcomes: The important roles necessary to start and support sustainability initiatives on your campus through partnerships; Finding ways to say YES - acting in partnership and seeking creative solutions to 'problems' gives university staff a seat at the table and the opportunity to provide excellent customer service while advancing campus sustainability; How to play the supporting role - doesn't matter where the idea comes from.

"Sustainable Campus Competition LIVE!: How $50,000 Created a Replicable Model for Citywide Composting","At the 2016 AASHE Conference, IUPUI and Butler University were awarded $50,000 as part of the Sustainable Campus Competition LIVE!, a collaboration between AASHE and Kimberly Clark. Because both campuses struggled with the cost of food waste collection and composting on their own, their application proposed utilizing the funds to create an economy of scale necessary to make food waste hauling a viable option for both campuses, as well as select community partners in Indianapolis. Since funding, IUPUI and Butler have created a citywide food waste collection model that is replicable in cities across the country. This presentation will outline the challenges both universities faced, developing the solution in collaboration with city partners, managing community relationships, and progress to date in the implementation of this new, commercial food waste collection route for Indianapolis.

Growing the BULB; Urban Ecology and Butler University's Living Building,"The BULB sits at the highest and most iconic location on campus adjacent to Holcomb Observatory and within 100' of the Carillon Tower which connects to an 'organ' at the Holcomb Garden House. This location creates opportunities for indoor and outdoor interpretive learning in conjunction with the biology department and observatory staff. The stakeholders consists of representatives of the Biology Department (which hosts the CUE), The Facilities Director and Campus Engineer, Director of the Observatory and members of the Indianapolis Community. Urban Ecology focuses on how the built environment can function in conjunction with or as natural systems. The BULB will exemplify many of these systems that can actually be seen in operation by students taking courses there or visitors to the BULB as well as outreach to the community CUE Urban Farm, located across the canal will also pay a pivotal role in the practical learning opportunities growing vegetables both indoors and in the CUE Urban Farm greenhouse. Living systems include Living Walls and Roof which purify air and water. A potable water system will be demonstrated which collects water off the roof in a cistern and circulates it through filters for drinking water producing more water than the building needs. Composting toilets and a graywater irrigation system eliminates the concept of waste. A 20kW PV system provides more energy than the building needs.

Utilizing Innovative and Peer Reviewed Carbon Offsets with the Second Nature Climate Leadership Commitments,"Many institutions use carbon offsets to help them attain carbon neutrality and achieve their goals under the Second Nature Climate Leadership Commitments. Since 2008, Second Nature has provided guidelines for the appropriate use of carbon offsets in fulfilling the commitments. In 2016, a Technical Advisory Group consisting of campus representatives and experts in the field revised Second Nature's guidelines on carbon offsetting and expanded opportunities for schools to internally develop offset projects. Schools are now allowed to offset a portion of emissions with 'peer reviewed' and 'innovative' offset projects. This makes carbon offset projects more accessible by reducing costs associated with third-party verification, and allows schools to be creative and develop projects that fit with the needs of their campus and community. Over the past year, the Duke Carbon Offset Initiative and Tomorrow's Climate Solutions have created The Offset Network, a central information hub for higher education offset projects. The Offset Network and Second Nature are working together to develop the framework and requirements for 'peer reviewed' and 'innovative' offsets. In this session we will discuss these new options for schools to develop local offset projects. Participants will hear examples of current projects, and learn about opportunities to engage with the offset network. We will discuss how this can fit in with carbon reduction strategies under the Climate Leadership Commitments.",Second Nature,0123,Duke University,1336,,,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,,,,,"carbon offsets,climate commitments",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Ruby Woodside,Innovative Services Manager,Second Nature,0123,Tani Colbert-Sangree,"Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative, Program Coordinator",Duke University,1336,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Woodside_2240.pdf,,,

Getting Started with Local Carbon Offsets: Spotlight on Urban Forestry,"For many schools working towards carbon neutrality, carbon offsets will play an important role. While offsets can be purchased on the open market, it is possible to have an even greater impact by catalyzing your own offsets that meet other goals of your institution (i.e. education, research, and community engagement). This presentation will highlight how three universities are using trees to: 1) create offsets, 2) foster funding mechanisms to expand tree plantings in municipalities, 3) expand knowledge and understanding of urban trees and carbon sequestration, 4) improve water quality, reduce urban heat island, and create more walkable cities and, 5) develop new ways to create verified and validated offsets without breaking the bank. We will provide lessons learned from project launch, management, long-term considerations, and future ideas.

Advancing Sustainability Through Health and Wellness Partnerships,"Thomas will highlight key partnerships between the Office of Sustainability and Human Resources at Washington University (WashU): the expansion of a Community Supported Agriculture program that encourages students and employees to eat fresh, local food; incorporation of an active transportation campaign into bi-annual wellness challenges; and cross-promotion of activities through WashU's Wellness Champions program, which engages employees across departments and academic disciplines. Valko will highlight a study on employee health in work spaces. In 2015, WashU completed construction of a building containing innovative features such as access to natural light, centrally located stairways, collaborative spaces, and sit/stand desks. The Brown School Expansion Evaluation Project was a multi-method, natural experiment assessing how building attributes affect physical activity, collaboration, and sustainability. Cheryl will provide an overview of the research and results. Bailey will discuss the application of one of Bob Willard's 7 Paradoxes of Sustainability Leadership, 'You Have to Do It Yourself - You Can't Do It Alone' as it relates to health and wellness partnerships at Indiana University South Bend.

Advancing the Green Building Movement through Community Action & Learning,"Every story about a green building is a story about people.' While many academic courses train students on the technical and philosophical aspects of sustainability, professional skills working with people are critical to success. Communication, critical thinking, creativity and collaboration are best learned through practice in real-life experiences. USGBC's ADVANCE campaign provides hands-on opportunities for students and young professionals to hone their technical and interpersonal skills while working with seasoned professionals and non-profit organizations in the field. Part learning, part community service, the ADVANCE campaign guides sustainable solutions for organizations who don't typically have access to the resources, time or capacity to move their aspirations into action.

Student-Led Pollinator Habitat Restoration Project: Low-Cost Implementation and Potential Applications,"Even at its outset, the new presidential administration has made it clear to the public that it is unwilling to support environmental protection at the federal level. In particular, the administration recently prevented what would have been the first-ever bee species from being added to the endangered species list. Given this reduction in federal resources and support for pollinators, it is crucial to reach out to a broader array of community groups and resources for continued progress. We demonstrate how university students can engage their city government and citizens to promote pollinator health by installing plants that support pollinators in local parks as economically as possible. We demonstrate how to add 1,000 pollinator plants along a local shared-use recreation trail with a budget of less than $500. This includes this cost of site preparation, materials and seeds, and volunteer coordination, all while requiring minimal expertise and commitment such that the project can be effectively replicated by other student groups at a similar cost. This presentation will provide a platform for campus sustainability groups to enact community-based sustainability solutions that are less financially daunting, so as to reach more students and further promote sustainability initiatives on any campus, regardless of its resources or background.",University of Kentucky,1600,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,"pollinators,habitats,student organizations,bees",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Jerrod Penn,,University of Kentucky,1600,Zoe Gabrielson,,University of Kentucky,1600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
High Priests of Sustainability?! The Promise and Perils of Becoming Your School's Moral Compass,"It began as a joke. When I first arrived, colleagues introduced me as the university's 'Green Guru.' Later I got a surprising compliment: 'You are the conscience of this university.' Now, after eight years as the sustainability coordinator at a large, public university, colleagues are coming to me with 'confessions' about their 'green sins.' Has this happened to you? Something's going on here that needs to be explored. Are we unintentionally becoming High Priests of Sustainability - the moral compass of secular institutions? What are the implications of this kind of a role for sustainability professionals? Join me for a discussion of our role, especially as it pertains to openly living our values and the ramifications for how we are viewed by others. How can we be effective change agents on a campus that is a community of people with ethical concerns and spiritual needs? With such broad agendas, it is vital to consider not just WHAT we do, but HOW we do it. Effective change management requires that we actually embody the desired change. Like it or not, we must become the moral compass. In making the case for change, our strength comes from the example we set. We must demonstrate that change is not only possible, but that it already lives within us. The environmental impact of our behavior is less important than the cognitive impact it has on us & others. I find that these small, quiet ways of being rather than forceful agitation in boardrooms ultimately spur the most change.",University of Louisville,1647,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,"change agents,campus culture,sustainability officers",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Ellen Trahan,UofL Dining Sustainability Coordinator,University of Louisville,1647,Justin Mog,Assistant to the Provost for Sustainability Initiatives,University of Louisville,1647,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045_Mog_2761.pdf,,,

"Saving Energy and Creating a Constant, Consistent, Repeatable Lab Environment at The University of Maryland IBBR","The University of Maryland Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research will outline the steps they took to reduce their energy consumption, further improve their environmental stabilization plant's reliability and improve the stability of their lab's environment. Despite being only five years old, by converting the IBBR's environmental stabilization plant to an all-variable flow plant and undertaking system optimization with Optimum Energy, the University of Maryland was able to improve their plant performance from 0.9 kW/ton to 0.57 - 0.65 kW/ton. They also receive automatic monthly maintenance reports from Optimum Energy's OptiCx platform, with prioritized recommendations, which helps keep the chillers running at peak performance. Depending on conditions, the environmental stabilization plant is now running 27 to 37 percent more efficiently. Similarly, in 2014 the plant was running at about 50 percent output.

Peruse the Used; Campus Thrift Shop and Move out Program,"At the beginning of the year students come to campus with carloads of excessive 'must have' college products. These items often have a short lifespan with their student as space is limited in resident halls. As a result, these gently used items make their way to the dumpster. In order to reduce the amount of reusable items in the landfill, Western State Colorado University students created FreeCycle: a student run thrift store where everything is free. FreeCycle is now managed by LEAD Sustainability Coordinators that work on campus. Items in FreeCycle are donated by students for students. We accept and receive a variety of gently used items ranging from art supplies, clothing, furniture, and outdoor equipment. Move out at the end of each academic year is when we receive the bulk of our donations. At the end of semester FreeCycle runs a program specifically to help with the moving our process which starts the week before students living in the dorms leave. This allows them to drop off reusable items that they no longer need. FreeCycle collects these items which are then stored until the next year. At the beginning of the next academic year, FreeCycle opens up to incoming freshman during orientation week to discourage students from buying unnecessary new items. Some donated items are no longer useful and are transformed into supplies for monthly Do It Yourself events. FreeCycle diverts about 2 gallon size bags of useable items from the landfill each week.",Western State Colorado University,1869,,,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,"thrift stores,move-in & move-out",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Cara Leapley,Sustainability Coordinator,Western State Colorado University,1869,Michela Schultz,Student,Western State Colorado University,1869,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introducing Students to Campus Sustainability through Interactive Tree Labeling,"Frostburg State University, recognized as Tree Campus USA for five years, has recently introduced an interactive tree labeling system. The labeled trees directly connect to a customizable webpage through smartphones or other mobile devices and provide information on our campus trees. Introducing the community to our trees and their values is a fundamental first step in sustainability awareness. These interactive tree labels have been applied to multidisciplinary projects that highlight various aspects of environmental sustainability. For example, labeled trees are used in freshman orientation courses through a scavenger hunt to introduce students to campus resources and emphasize that the trees are part of these resources. The trees are used in Geography courses for GIS and spatial analysis applications, in Biology courses for tree identification, and in interdisciplinary Ethnobotany courses to teach natural resources through the lens of culture. Labeled trees can also inspire campus art and history projects. In addition to these academic potentials, the trees have been entered into the US Forest Services's iTree Streets program that provides numeric data on benefits trees provide for reduced energy use, storm water management, and mitigation of air pollutants, thus assisting campus grounds decision-making.

Students Put Their Money Where Their Values Are: The JCCC Sustainability Initiatives Fund,"This poster describes Johnson County Community College's Student Sustainability Committee. The Committee, formed in 2011 as part of a student-led initiative for a dollar-per-credit hour fee to fund sustainable initiatives on campus, focuses on three broad categories: integrating sustainability into campus curriculum, events, and programming; improving daily operations with a focus on sustainable practices; and transforming the physical campus into a living, learning laboratory. The SSC is a compelling and powerful tool for developing student leadership skills and sustainability knowledge while expanding sustainability conversations by funding standing projects and events. The Committee and its fund pilot projects both for operations and student engagement opportunities, and offer our students the chance to work within and positively influence campus culture as leaders for more sustainable behaviors.",Johnson County Community College,2128,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Investment & Finance,Coordination & Planning,,,"committees,funding",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Nils Beverlin,Sustainability Initiatives Intern,Johnson County Community College,2128,Theodore Tjardes,,Johnson County Community College,2128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
University-Local Government Collaborations on Sustainability,"Climate change can be effectively addressed at a local, rather than national, scale. Cities and universities represent the centers of commerce and culture, as well as the world's population and pollution: more than half the world's population resides in cities, with urban areas contributing approximately 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. By studying local governments and their resident institutions of higher education, we are highlighting the importance of collaboration on sustainability, and how these partnerships have led to precipitous action on climate change and accelerated the creation of community-wide benefits. Through a qualitative analysis of these networks and the projects they have and continue to organize, our research highlights how communities are catalysts for change. This research is being conducted under the advisement of the Executive Director of ICLEI USA, Angie Fyfe. ICLEI USA works with higher education affiliates, which provided a new network of institutions to interact with. The research is focused on examining these collaborations through a series of interviews with individuals who are leading the efforts in sustainability co-creation at both institutions, and who together are establishing networks for a shared understanding of these sustainability collaborations.",University of Colorado Boulder,2130,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Public Engagement,,,,"government,civic engagement,partnerships",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Samuel Krasnobrod,Graduate Student Researcher,University of Colorado Boulder,2130,Kate Manzer,,University of Colorado Boulder,2130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Needed: Systemic Change and Collaboration to Confront Shared Challenges - PepsiCo, UC Boulder, and other Universities break new","Sustainability leaders are no longer asking themselves 'how can we do better,' and instead are asking, 'how can we do enough?' To answer that question we are partnering with universities and end-to-end in our value chain in ways that were unthinkable a few years ago. Come learn how we're breaking new ground both on campus and in our supply chain and hear what our university partners are telling us they need on campus. We'll specifically discuss how PepsiCo's Zero Impact Fund is supporting students' fresh thinking and the surprising results our on-campus research with UC Boulder turned up. Audience Engagement: We will engage the audience by asking them three questions: 1) How many people know the source and volume of their organizations' Scopes 1 and 2 carbon emissions? 2) How many people know the source and volume of their organizations' Scope 3 carbon emissions? 3) What carbon emission sources are the largest? We will ask for a show of hands for questions one and two and audible responses to the last to highlight whether students know the answer to the third topic and understand their role in creating those emissions.

Leveraging AASHE STARS for Organizational Change,"Boston University's Sustainability Director and sustainability@BU Intern for STARS will review their process for gathering, vetting, and reporting data for submission to STARS. STARS has allowed the University to annually track progress on its sustainability initiatives. They will also discuss how they leverage the process to engage staff and the administration to champion change for sustainability across STARS' eighteen issue areas. Boston University began reporting to STARS in 2011. It is one of only a few institutions that report on an annual basis. The STARS process at sustainability@BU is integral to internally organizing metrics regarding curriculum, research, operational characteristics, and planning and engagement. The effort is led by the sustainability@BU Intern for STARS who collects the data from 38 departments across campus to form the STARS report. In the interest of continuous improvement, she is also responsible for recommending improvements to the University's reporting methodology. To communicate to the President and senior administrators when requesting the President's Letter of Affirmation, sustainability@BU provides a high-level summary that outlines the University's provisional score in each category, a comparison to the reporting average, and what it will take to improve the University's score.

Sustainability Ambassadors: Modeling a Culture of Sustainability at New Student Orientation,"The mission of the Sustainability Ambassadors program is to motivate, inspire, and lead Boston University's efforts in supporting a culture of sustainability during new student orientation. The approach to incorporating sustainability principles is a five-pronged effort. The main effort includes face-to-face engagement with new students and families, making operations like food waste sorting more transparent, a 'Did You Know' poster campaign, maintaining interim communications with new students, and finally, layering sustainability awareness into the Common Ground program-an opportunity for new Terriers to have meaningful discussions while exploring their new city. This presentation will highlight the outcomes of this innovative peer-to-peer outreach program and show how working within the existing student affairs structure can be advantageous for all departments. The highlights of the Sustainability Ambassadors pilot program and its second year will be shared, including heightened awareness of sustainability concepts such as energy reduction and even related course offerings for new students. Boston University is a diverse, international community that is home to students from 50 states and 133 nations.

Riverbank Climate Collaboration: How MIT and BU are preparing for Climate Change from Both Sides of the River,"Preparing urban university campuses for the complexities and uncertainties of new and intensifying climate risks requires aggregating diverse expertise and resources including climate science, urban planning, utility and building systems engineering, hydrology, university and government leadership, community, public health, students and faculty. While MIT, Boston University and UMASS Boston are advancing climate resiliency planning at campus-scales, they are also contributing to the climate consensus and resiliency planning for Boston and Cambridge. These institutions are leveraging research to help the region adapt to intensifying climate risks from inland flooding, chronic heat stress and sea level rise/storm surge. Located within a few miles of eachother, MIT, Boston University and UMASS Boston will highlight steps each institution is taking to inform campus and city-based planning and policy decisions such as activating the campus as test beds for climate resiliency research; generating new data and modelling methods; linking resiliency planning with educational outcomes; and, developing campus resiliency plans. The panel will also speak to lessons that are helping translate climate complexities and uncertainties into local planning inputs for growing engagement from diverse sectors of the campus and city community.

Sustainable Collaboration: Solving the Commuter Crisis,"Minimizing the number of vehicles traveling to and parking on campus, while also reducing Houston's carbon footprint and improving the region's air quality is a critical goal of the University of Houston. In June 2016, in an effort to align with that goal and better serve an ever-increasing campus community of more than 43,000 students and 8,155 faculty and staff, the school's Parking and Transportation Services team launched COAST, an alternative transportation incentive program. An initiative to counter growing parking demands, COAST was necessary, but for a school situated in a city where multi-lane freeways and commuting alone were the norm, the team knew they would face some obstacles in their quest for success. Through working with partners like the local transit authority, they developed a program that offers incentives to individuals opting to carpool or use public transportation instead of purchasing a campus parking permit. Thanks in part to appealing discounts, a robust marketing and communications campaign and a partnership with the UH Office of Sustainability, the program has been successful. A first-year goal to recruit 815 participants was surpassed in just four months and COAST's current 1,869 members translates to 1,725 fewer vehicles commuting through the area. From strategies and struggles to future opportunities, presenters will share their takeaways from this experience and how others might be able to start a similar initiative at their institute",University of Houston,2287,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation,Campus Engagement,,,Transportation & Parking,"commuting,parking",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Esmeralda Valdez,Assistant Vice President for University Services,University of Houston,2287,Maria Honey,"Director of Sustainability, Marketing and Outreach",University of Houston,2287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Honey_2399.pdf,,,
Leveraging Student Activity Fees to Catalyze High Impact Sustainability Projects,"According to the AASHE Campus Sustainability Revolving Loan Funds Database, the growth of Green Revolving Funds (GRFs) has exploded to include over 80 institutions representing over $100 Million. Techniques behind the creation and utilization of GRFs vary across the spectrum of Higher Education. Bowling Green State University implemented a modified GRF, the 'Student Green Initiatives Fund' in 2011. The fund, derived from an optional student activity fee and utility rebates, has raised tens of thousands of dollars, receiving support from close to 90% of the student body on average. A committee composed of students, faculty and staff and managed by Campus Sustainability reviews project applications while working closely with Campus Operations in implementing projects. BGSU partnered with Sightlines to track their greenhouse gas inventory and assess sustainability performance across a number of metrics in alignment with institutional goals. Significant success has been achieved not only in contributing to energy reductions (29% decrease in kWh/GSF since 2010), but also in proliferating sustainability in the culture of the institution and changing behaviors. This poster will illustrate the creation and growth of the fund, the successes of several key initiatives made possible by the fund, while providing key operational data points in support of those successes and overall carbon footprint reduction.",Sightlines,2222,Bowling Green State University,2303,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Investment & Finance,,,,"student fees,green funds",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Cody Lorentson,,Sightlines,2222,Nick Hennessy,Sustainability Manager,Bowling Green State University,2303,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Lorentson_2379.pdf,,,
Sustainability Council-- Collaboration Among Student Organizations Is Key to Sustainable Success at Ohio State,"As a major land-grant institution, The Ohio State University offers many opportunities for student involvement in sustainability. The University has over 100 sustainability-oriented organizations-- each with is own mission. Recently, students have recognized that although these groups may have separate, individualized goals, they are intrinsically devoted to the same, ultimate goal. Four years ago, a coalition under the name of The Sustainability Council of The Ohio State University was formed in order to connect student leaders in a number of these organizations. The Sustainability Council remains a self-governed entity that works to encourage collaboration on projects and events, allocate funding to groups, and create a space for effective communication across the spectrum of energy, environment, and sustainability-related organizations. These biweekly meetings have ultimately increased efficiency, effectiveness, and legitimacy of 18+ students organizations.",The Ohio State University,2335,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,student organizations,10/15/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Michelle Wentling,Sustainability Council President,The Ohio State University,2335,Marie McConnell,Treasurer of Sustainability Council,The Ohio State University,2335,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Utilizing the Garden to Integrate Community-Based Learning in the Classroom,"The purpose of this presentation is to explore, discuss and reflect on Community-based Learning (CBL) as a form of civic education utilizing a school learning garden or community garden. CBL is considered one of the newer approaches to connecting academic study and community service. It has gained increasing value in academia because of its potential to enhance students' personal and professional development. Integrating CBL into a course using a garden is a great way for students to learn about the three principles of sustainability (social, environmental and economic). The garden provides experiential education and lifelong learning opportunities for students, faculty, staff and community members. CBL activities utilizing a garden can be used in any class from any discipline.. Presenters of this interactive session will share the activities they have developed, their work with colleagues, student responses, and the challenges that have emerged.

Student Learning Outcomes in Sustainability Education: Faculty Participation and Measured Student Learning,"Sustainability degrees are becoming increasingly common in higher education. There are over 420 institutions now offering programs related to sustainability that range from certificates to doctoral degrees. There are at least 61 undergraduate sustainability degrees at institutions of higher learning in the United States. Almost all of these programs are new, having started within the past decade, including the undergraduate sustainability major at the University of South Dakota (USD), which began in August 2012. In this presentation, we will describe (1) the student learning outcomes (SLOs) for the USD sustainability major, (2) the estimated extent to which faculty are incorporating and assessing the SLOs into their courses, and (3) measured student performance on the SLOs from the students' entry into the major through the capstone course. We found that the core courses of the sustainability major were more likely to address the SLOs of the major than elective courses. Student performance on the SLOs increased from the introductory courses to the capstone course. Sustainability majors participated in an average of ten experiential learning opportunities focused on sustainability. Our findings highlighted a need to provide more faculty training in sustainability and documented student learning and engagement over the course of the sustainability major curriculum.",University of South Dakota,2548,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,"learning outcomes,degree programs,assessment",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Meghann Jarchow,Assistant Professor and Sustainability Program Coordinator,University of South Dakota,2548,Matthew Sayre,"Associate Professor, Department Chair",University of South Dakota,2548,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045_Jarchow_2284.pdf,,,

A study-away experience in Costa Rica through the eyes of students and faculty from Trinity University.,"Few places in the world are as biologically diverse as Costa Rica and as such it is a captivating and educational place to visit for students interested in sustainability. Trinity University has a study-away course in Costa Rica with the specific learning outcome to 'understand how the complex geography and climate from sea-level to the continental divide influences the current distribution and abundance of plants and animals in Costa Rica with a focus on vertebrates.' Additionally, this course seeks to satisfy Trinity's Global Awareness (GA) learning outcomes by 'analyzing major historical events and processes that have given the regions in question their unique cultural character or affected their relations with other people of the world.' In this presentation, we will reflect on the connections between these different learning outcomes and how they intersect with perspectives from both faculty and students. Furthermore, as an interactive session, we will have participants reflect on why these learning outcomes are important and how best to achieve them in a study away setting.

A Sustainable Energy Laboratory Course for Non-Science Majors,"Using sustainable energy to address climate change is of growing importance as society tries to balance its energy needs while minimizing environmental impacts. To help students better understand this balance, we developed a one credit sustainable energy laboratory course suitable for high school and undergraduate students. The laboratory, and a complementary three-credit sustainable energy lecture, satisfies Eastern Connecticut State University's natural science requirement. Thus, non-science majors comprise >85% of the enrollment. Students gain a broad, engaging and relevant overview of sustainable energy through thirteen hands-on exercises that touch upon the basic principles of wind power, photovoltaics, electric cars, lighting, electric circuits, heating/cooling, insulation, and solar collectors. Instructors can easily re-order or modify content presentation and instructional level to suit their individual needs and/or academic program. Laboratory goals are to increase sustainable energy (science) literacy, student awareness and participation in sustainable practices, and strengthen student skills in mathematics and critical thinking. Meeting once a week for 105 minutes, the first 20 minutes consists of a brief introduction. Students spend the remaining time making measurements and calculations, and drawing conclusions.

"Nudging commuters, big data and bold partnerships: A research-based approach to impacting commuter mode choice at MIT","Researchers at MIT's Transit Lab, alongside MIT's operational decision-makers, have been examining commuter patterns at MIT for years. They helped launch a pilot collaboration between MIT and the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA), which gave 1,000 MIT employees new daily commuting options by providing no-cost access to subways and local buses. The success of this pilot led to the development of the Access MIT program, launched during the summer of 2016, in partnership with the Office of Sustainability. Access MIT includes a series of benefits that encourage commuters to switch from single-occupancy vehicle commuting in favor of transit, carpooling and active modes of transportation. The flagship element of the program is the introduction of zero-cost local transit passes to all benefits-eligible employees- about 11,000 individuals- making it among the largest employers in the state to offer such a benefit. In addition, annual parking permits have been replaced with daily pricing in order to remove the sunk cost of yearly permits. A newly developed marketing campaign and an online dashboard seek to further engage commuters in rethinking their commuting choices. MIT is seeking to achieve a 10% reduction in parking demand over the next two years and hopes the program offers a model for others when managing commuter demand in densely populated areas. This presentation will tell the story of Access MIT and provide the results of the first year of research.",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,2697,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation,Campus Engagement,Research,,,"behavior change,commuting,u-pass,public transit,parking,data",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Susy Jones,Project Manager,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,2697,Adam Rosenfield,"Graduate Student, Urban Planning and Transportation",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,2697,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Lending Library: Addressing Textbook Affordability and Reducing Waste,"As college textbook prices continue to rise, access to the resources needed to succeed in a course has become a social justice issue. The Lending Library, which was started in Fall 2013 by students in the Office of Sustainability, is an attempt to address this issue at Connecticut College. The Lending Library currently contains 1,9276 books used in courses on our campus and serves approximately 100 students per semester. Students can rent a book from the Lending Library for free at the beginning of each semester and keep it for the duration of their course. In Spring 2017, the campus Academic Resource Center expressed a desire to work with the Lending Library to actually purchase some of the most expensive textbooks and place them on reserve at the campus library for the semester. Based on the cost of books checked out for the Spring 2017 semester, the Lending Library saved students $15,135. This program helps reduce waste, lower the cost of taking courses at Connecticut College, and provides students with valuable leadership experience.

UT Austin Campus Environmental Center: Student-led Environmental Action,"Bridging the gap between student interest and administrative support can be challenging in a bureaucratic university, especially when students seek operational changes towards sustainable practices. The UT Austin Campus Environmental Center (CEC) demonstrates a case of creating a nexus between student-driven ideas and institutional operations. CEC incubates novel student projects and then serves to connect those projects with funding and administrative support. Examples include an organic farm, a Greek-life outreach program, and a waste-diverting campus thrift store. The CEC's resources afford students the opportunity to demonstrate a project's feasibility and value before it is institutionalized. This 'project-only' model of CEC succeeds in developing independent projects; however, it does not sufficiently stimulate the exchange of ideas among students, faculty, and staff nor does it effectively promote an educated 'culture change' towards sustainability within UT Austin. To address these pitfalls of the 'project-only' model, CEC is trialing a 'community-plus-project' model of operation. CEC leaders have focused on developing CEC as a community of students interested in environmental issues by integrating aspects of a 'traditional' student organization with the CEC project incubation model. They aim to remedy issues of the 'project-only' model by creating an organizational structure that allows for meaningful opportunities of inquiry and action across a diverse domain.",University of Texas at Austin,3049,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Investment & Finance,,,,"funding,students",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,James Collins,,University of Texas at Austin,3049,Anthony Rivera,Ambassador,University of Texas at Austin,3049,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Green Labs at The University of Texas at Austin,"The Office of Sustainability's Green Labs program at The University of Texas at Austin is a student-led initiative that serves as a resource to help researchers run a more sustainable and eco-friendly lab without interfering with their research. Our goal is to build a community among campus labs and to work together towards achieving sustainable goals. The program promotes recycling and reuse of materials, the reduction of hazardous materials with regards to toxicity and quantity, improved energy and water efficiency, and better inventory control. The Green Labs team works closely with the City of Austin and the Department of Environmental Health & Safety to carry out specialty recycling on campus tailored to lab needs, including batteries, Styrofoam, cold packs, plastic film, and Nitrile gloves. More than 2,300 pounds of these items were diverted from waste fields and recycled in the Spring of 2017 alone. Most importantly, the program serves as an opportunity for students to take on leadership roles where they can work with the greater Austin community to make a lasting impact on the culture of sustainability. We will provide an overview of the program structure, the initiatives carried out, and the effects/impacts that have been made on UT's campus.",University of Texas at Austin,3049,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Energy,Waste,,,green labs,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Jessica Escobar,Green Labs Student Associate,University of Texas at Austin,3049,Ariana Rodriguez,,University of Texas at Austin,3049,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Escobar_3006.pdf,,,
Quadruple Bottom Line Analysis,"Quadruple Bottom Line (QBL) Analysis uses mission-aligned sustainability impact areas to strengthen carbon reduction project assessment. Often single-bottom, financial, or non-rigorous 'reputational' factors, drive decision making. QBL uses a metrics framework to assess projects across four impacts areas: People, Prosperity, Planet, and Purpose. How does a solution meet the needs of People on campus, in the community and in the world? Does it enhance campus & community Prosperity now, and in the future? Will it support a sustainable Planet? Does it help the campus fulfill its academic mission and Purpose? By creating this assessment process which combines qualitative & quantitative analysis with strong financial tools for appropriately valuing carbon, upstream fuel-source emissions, and future risk, QBL can be used to assess and compare campus climate solutions at the operational and unit level. This workshop will focus on how to develop financial and QBL impact analysis tools for valuing climate neutrality solutions. Using tools developed by a team of senior administrators, campus financial stewards, sustainability officers, and facilities engineers at Cornell University for a 2016 report which compared 10 carbon-neutral solutions for meeting campus energy needs, participants will unpack developing criteria for project evaluation, how to develop consensus with decision-makers, and specific applications of the quadruple bottom line framework.",Cornell University,3066,,,,,,,,,,,,,Investment & Finance,Coordination & Planning,,,,"quadruple bottom line analysis,full cost analysis",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Andrew Germain,LEAD - Leadership Enhancement and Accelerated Development Program,Cornell University,3066,Sarah Brylinsky,Sustainability Communications & Business Integration Manager,Cornell University,3066,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Brylinsky_2841.pptx,,,
Plants on the Plate: Meeting Student Demand for Sustainable Plant-Based Dining.,"Market forces are shifting the ground beneath institutional food services, and most of them are far beyond what operators have the power to control. While they are hard to predict, they are easy to understand, because they all spring from evolving student demand for more sustainable dining. Major moves from the large food service organizations toward plant-based menus, clean ingredients, and local sourced foods are just a few of the changes being dictated by student preferences. Ken Botts helped open the nation's first 'vegan' dining hall at University of North Texas in 2010. That dining hall helped set the stage on how to deliver sustainable plant-based menus. In 2014 he joined the HSUS Food and Nutrition team and helped create a free plant-based culinary training program. The first one was taught at Harvard University in January of 2015 and since then his team has trained over 1100 culinary professionals from over 50 universities around the nation. Ken will share best practices from universities that are successfully putting plants on the plate and show how this move can significantly decrease a universities carbon footprint. Joining Ken is Therese O'Connor, Assistant Director of training and development for Cornell University Dining and Catering. In January 2012, Cornell University received a STARS Gold rating for sustainability from AASHE. Therese will share how Cornell University dining is reducing their carbon footprint by implementing new and exciting dining options.",Humane Society of the United States,6683,Cornell University,3066,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,,,,vegan & vegetarian dining,10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Kenneth Botts,Food and Nutrition Manager,Humane Society of the United States,6683,Therese O'Connor,"Assistant Director, Staff Training & Development",Cornell University,3066,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1130_Botts_2507.pptx,,,
Empowering Solidarity Through Shared Sustainability Vision and Leadership,"Solidarity unifies diversity, creativity and passion toward a common goal. Through a shared sustainability position, Iowa State University's Office of Sustainability and the City of Ames, Iowa, unite together to educate, engage and empower our campus and community in sustainability. Events targeting community beautification and cleanup, waste diversion and repurposing and initiatives featuring sustainability accomplishment and opportunity in the business community are some of the components that have cultivated and enhanced strides in solidarity toward our collective vision of sustainable future.

The Campus Climate is Heating up!: A Case Study of Student Activism at a Liberal Arts University,"Campus communities are a particular type of environment, uniquely affected by the political state of the surrounding area. Just as a politician's constituents should determine her platform, students at a university have the power to drive their administration, enact change, shift culture, and overcome bureaucratic barriers. Sustainability at Southwestern has been significantly shaped by this influence, as most of the university's related initiatives have been led and maintained by its students. This session aims to detail these efforts and the realities of implementing student-led change at a small liberal arts university in a conservative state. We will discuss strategies for effectively collaborating with administration as student activists, with a focus on the current efforts at Southwestern that address the recent shifts in the political climate. Some of these notable efforts include drafting and presenting a proposal for the establishment of a task force against hate crimes; securing funding for the formation of a comprehensive peer network to provide resources for victims of sexual assault; and organizing solidarity marches on campus in support of our marginalized community members. As nationwide student activism on campuses intensifies, it is increasingly important to identify ways to effectively enact change and weave social justice efforts into wider narratives of sustainability, and Southwestern's student work provides evidence of this.",Southwestern University,3154,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,"activism,students,change management",10/15/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Keara Hudler,Student Sustainability Coordinator,Southwestern University,3154,Simone Yoxall,"Student Research Assisstant, Environmental Studies Department",Southwestern University,3154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Southwestern University Campus as a Living Laboratory,"As a small liberal arts school in the middle of conservative Central Texas, Southwestern provides a unique example of a case study for increasing the sustainability of an institution of higher education. After former president Jake B. Schrum signed the Talloires Declaration, it was left up to staff, faculty, and, above all else, the students to hold the university accountable for its claimed dedication to sustainability. In recent years, the Southwestern community has led a number of efforts to transform the campus into a more socially and environmentally conscious place. The switch to 100% wind energy; the creation of the Green Fund as a grant opportunity for sustainable projects; the funding for a Student Sustainability Coordinator position; and the earning of a Silver rating from the STARS program are only a few of the ways the community has showed its dedication to sustainability in the past six years. As the state of the world changes and the validity of environmental and social concerns are challenged by our leaders, the importance of community-driven initiatives has only increased. Analyzing Southwestern's struggles and accomplishments as a case study on how students have the power to shift campus culture and create a sustainable environment only strengthens the argument that there is power in numbers to achieve noble goals.",Southwestern University,3154,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,living labs,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Keara Hudler,Student Sustainability Coordinator,Southwestern University,3154,Simone Yoxall,"Student Research Assisstant, Environmental Studies Department",Southwestern University,3154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Leveraging Living Building Challenge Standards across Campus Operations,"How do you show faculty, staff and students that a building is alive and empower them to keep it healthy? As the most stringent green building certification in the world, the Living Building Challenge TM (LBC) requires buildings to embody ecologically restorative design and operational performance. Embracing LBC in one building inevitably changes operational mindsets and practices across campus. This session will showcase the experiences of two institutions that took the plunge to design and operate a building to LBC standards, and the ongoing journey to educate, engage and inform the campus community to contribute to successful building performance. Hampshire College will share operational and engagement lessons learned from their formative building, the R.W. Kern Center, completed in April 2016. Learn how the LBC process has made Hampshire better at owning and operating campus buildings. Georgia Institute of Technology, with its Living Building at Georgia Tech project completing design development, will detail an early engagement approach that encourages operational staff to use existing campus facilities to test 'state of the shelf' as well as alternative technologies and operations and maintenance practices prior to implementation in this new project. A specific focus will also be given to occupant engagement best practices from design through occupancy and how to leverage the LBC criteria to improve sustainable operations standards across the campus portfolio.",Georgia Institute of Technology,1109,Hampshire College,3276,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,,"living buildings,occupant engagement",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Anne Rogers,Associate Director,Georgia Institute of Technology,1109,Todd Holland,Projects and Operations Manager,Hampshire College,3276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Holland_2307.pdf,,,
Instituting Plastic Wrap Recycling in a University Setting: A Case Study,"Since its creation in 1995, the MUSC Recycling Department has grown into a massive operation serving the recycling needs of over 14,000 FTE employees in 131 buildings including confidential paper shredding. To go beyond our traditionally recyclable streams (i.e. paper, plastic, glass, metal) we are currently in the process of setting up programs to divert soft plastics like plastic bags and plastic wraps. This session will explore different programs we have instituted at MUSC to collect and divert plastic wrap. One example of this is 'blue wrap': a material used to wrap clean medical equipment and tools before use. This cloth-like material is actually #5 plastic and can be recycled. To start recycling blue wrap, we worked together with clinical staff and implemented this program 3 years ago in two locations. We collect blue wrap from these locations, bale it, and have it picked up by our local recycler, Sonoco. Clear plastic, used to package scrubs, are also collected from 3 clinical areas in a program starting two years ago. A more universal example is consumer plastic bags (#4 plastic). With the help of Moore Recycling and Associates, we are piloting public drop off locations for plastic bags on campus. From this case study we hope other universities would be better prepared to start plastic bag recycling programs of their own. We hope that collecting soft plastics will also help to keep them out of our recycling bins and MRFs.",Medical University of South Carolina,3315,,,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Coordination & Planning,,,,"plastics,plastic bags,recycling",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,John Brooker,Sustainability Communications Specialist,Medical University of South Carolina,3315,Christine von Kolnitz,Sustainability Manager,Medical University of South Carolina,3315,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Brooker_2443.pdf,,,

How to Expand a Recycling Program for Future Years,"With a barren desert, no political will to implement policy nor financial incentive to push Nevadans to recycle, recycling in Nevada is virtually nonexistent. Currently, due to low landfill tipping fees and lack of waste diversion laws, there is no financial incentive for recycling. In fact, UNLV experiences a net loss from recycling. This past semester, the UNLV VP of Finance granted the Student Sustainability Council twelve new recycling bins, upon convincing him the need to invest in sustainability and potentially, an Office of Sustainability. The plan is to strategically integrate these recycling bins on campus grounds as an ongoing project as well as requesting for new bins each semester. Looking into dual recycling bins with both recycling and trash options, the Council's objective is to decrease the amount of existing trash cans, thereby increasing recycling bins and thus making recycling more accessible. Through tabling events, an aggressive marketing campaign and outreach, can the Council get insight into student demand. The creative messaging will paint the school in recycling propaganda. For outreach, the Council is collaborating with social activist groups for a gender-neutral clothing swap and drive for homeless LGBTIQ youth, as well as creating informative workshops about socio-economic issues and global sustainability, tackling social sustainability and waste reduction.",University of Nevada Las Vegas,3649,,,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,recycling,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Amber Mixson,Outreach Coordinator,University of Nevada Las Vegas,3649,Cielomina Gumabon,Co- Outreach Coordinator,University of Nevada Las Vegas,3649,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Mixson_2778.pdf,,,
Models for Collaborative and Implementable Pan-Campus Sustainability Plans,"Taking sustainability to the next level, for many higher education institutions, requires a strategic, long-range, and comprehensive sustainability plan. The process by which you develop content, engage the campus community and create buy-in with key decision-makers around a sustainability plan determines a plan's future implementation success. Representatives at three research institutions - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Georgia Institute of Technology, and North Carolina State University - recently completed the process to create new sustainability plans and will share three different approaches to achieve success in this process. The learning outcomes for this interactive, advanced session include: how to read your campus landscape and assess programmatic strengths pre-planning; how to identify and best engage key decision-makers; how to make a plan live and achieve implementation success; how to communicate before, during and after the plan development process; and how to develop relevant outcomes and metrics for ongoing reporting.",Georgia Institute of Technology,1109,North Carolina State University,3655,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,"sustainability plans,planning",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Anne Rogers,Associate Director,Georgia Institute of Technology,1109,Tracy Dixon,Sustainability Director,North Carolina State University,3655,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Dixon_2177.pdf,,,
"Carbon Pricing & Higher Ed: Internal Carbon Fees, Using Shadow Prices for Life Cycle Analysis, & Engaging Beyond the Campus","This interactive workshop will examine different models for internal carbon pricing, including models adopted by Yale, Vassar and Swarthmore. We will cover revenue neutral prices, prices that generate funds for sustainability and incorporating shadow prices on GHG emissions into life cycle cost analysis. We will explore the role of higher education in national carbon pricing efforts, including the 'Put a Price on It' campaign and how college and university presidents are working with students to lead on this issue. Using case studies from higher education and businesses that already have implemented internal carbon pricing, we will explore the benefits of, and challenges involved in, incorporating carbon pricing into your program. Also covered: how to build campus support and buy-in for carbon pricing, how it can be used as an educational tool, and as a potential internal funding source. We will support attendees in developing a plan to explore carbon pricing at their home institution. The workshop will cover: * Economics of carbon pricing * Carbon fees vs.cap and trade * Using campus carbon pricing to fund sustainability * How carbon pricing can help you engage beyond the campus * Model & Pilot - use the microcosm of the campus to model different pricing policies * A look at three different approaches to carbon pricing: Vassar, Yale and Swarthmore * Carbon pricing endorsement campaigns * Shadow prices as part of life cycle cost analysis * Ways to seek buy-in",Swarthmore College,3879,Yale University,3678,,,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,Public Engagement,,,carbon pricing,10/18/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Aurora Winslade,Director of Sustainability,Swarthmore College,3879,Casey Pickett,Director of the Carbon Charge,Yale University,3678,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Engaging Partners in Source Reduction,"40% of food produced in the U.S. is lost or wasted each year (FAO, 2014). Through data capture, staff training and guest education, University of California, Irvine (UCI) Hospitality & Dining in conjunction with their dining partner, Aramark, divert food waste from landfills and minimize food waste generated. In addition to diverting over 95% of food waste from UCI's dining halls from landfills, UCI and Aramark have engaged in several programs designed to identify key areas in operations to minimize waste and to engage guests in reducing food waste. Through the use of tools such as LeanPath to record food waste, Aramark is able to precisely measure causes of food loss and waste. Using this information, the dining team can focus training and develop new procedures to target top contributing factors for food waste. Combining this data with a 4-week waste study of UCI's largest dining hall, The Anteatery, which serves 6,000 meals a day, UCI Hospitality & Dining and Aramark have also identified standard waste composition between pre-consumer and post-consumer waste. Through programs such as 'Wiping Out Waste' and 'Love Your Food, Don't Waste It,' Green Captains and other student Fellows engage with guests on specific actions they can take to reduce post-consumer food waste.",Aramark Higher Education,3691,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Food & Dining,Waste,,,food waste,10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Tyson Monagle,Marketing Coordinator,Aramark Higher Education,3691,Jenna Hagerich,"Director, Consumer Engagement",Aramark Higher Education,3691,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compost and Collaboration: Reaching Zero Waste at UCI in Dining Commons and Residence Halls,"The University of California system and UC Irvine have committed to reaching Zero Waste, or 95% diversion from landfill by 2020. In 2016, UCI reached 83% diversion, the highest rate in the system. Food waste composting in dining commons and residence halls is a key aspect of our campus solid waste plan. Compost on campus was the result of strategic collaboration and teamwork both behind the scenes and via public education campaigns among UCI Facilities Management, Hospitality & Dining and Aramark, and Housing. Facilities will share about our waste-to-energy food waste compost program. Dining presenters will share about the creation of the first daily-user Zero Waste dining facility in the UC system and how they now maintain a Zero Waste facility serving 36,000 meals a week. Housing presenters will share about the introduction of compost bins into the apartment and communal kitchens of UCI's 6 residential communities serving 9,000 residents. Each presenter will share best practices for infrastructure planning as well as community building and student and staff engagement for sustainability literacy and behavior change.

Campus Gardens: Increasing Sustainability and Lowering Food Insecurity,"In this session, we will focus on the role campus gardens can play in educating faculty, students, and staff about sustainable food systems as well as their role in alleviating food insecurity both on and off campus. We will draw on our experience establishing a campus garden at West Chester University in March of 2015. The effort was led by two faculty members; however, students were integral to the garden design process, construction, and continued maintenance. Our garden also functions through a partnership with the Pennsylvania Horticulture Society's (PHS) City Harvest Program. City Harvest supports over 100 community gardens in Philadelphia and the surrounding region with the goal of expanding access to healthy and sustainably produced fruits and vegetables. Each Spring break a group of West Chester University students spend their week working with PHS to plant seedlings to distribute to the community gardens, they help clean up existing gardens, and they help construct new garden beds. In return, we receive a portion of the seedlings and other supplies PHS providers to community garden participants. Throughout the growing season, we use the garden to teach the campus community about organic gardening practices, seasonality, and native plants. We then donate the bulk of our harvest to our local food pantry and our on-campus resource pantry to address hunger among our students and in the surrounding community.",West Chester University of Pennsylvania,3773,,,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Grounds,,,"gardens,food security,",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Ashlie Delshad,Associate Professor of Political Science,West Chester University of Pennsylvania,3773,Lynn Monahan,Assistant Professor,West Chester University of Pennsylvania,3773,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045_Delshad_2320.pptx,,,
Mapping Your Campus Metabolism: Taking a Systems Approach to Understanding Material Flows on Your Campus,"As campuses strive to become increasingly more sustainable, a comprehensive, integrated systems understanding of a university's campus metabolism and key material flows (water, energy, food, and materials) is essential for improving efficiency, minimizing waste, and meeting national commitments like the ACUPCC. A metabolic framework posits a system as a biological being that consumes, metabolizes, and transforms resources, and excretes waste. Numerous studies have applied this framework to understanding cities ('urban metabolism'), however few, if any, have applied it to a college campus ('campus metabolism'). We have attempted to apply this framework to Furman University by mapping the inflows, transformations, and material outflows of four resources (water, energy, food, and materials) and identify the key stakeholders within each system. In this session we will briefly present the framework and the concept of a campus metabolism. After which, we will engage participants in a discussion around the process of mapping their own campus metabolisms through developing a series of conceptual flow models that outline the inflows, transformations, and material outflows of various key campus resources and identify the key stakeholders within each system for their own university. We hope this process provides a holistic systems framework for understanding campus sustainability and inspires them to map their own campus metabolism post AASHE meeting.",Furman University,3836,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,"campus metabolisms,systems thinking",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Weston Dripps,Executive Director,Furman University,3836,Kelly Grant Purvis,Associate Director of Sustainability Programs,Furman University,3836,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Dripps_2377.pptx,,,

Beyond Waste Diversion: Advancing Sustainable Materials Management at Emory,"Emory University's Sustainability Vision calls for aggressive waste minimization, including 95% diversion from landfills by 2025. Further, Emory is committed to the highest and best use of materials, innovation, transparent reporting, and collaborative partnerships. In 2015, Emory's Office of Sustainability Initiatives convened the Waste Think Tank, facilitating conversations with building designers, custodial leadership, and recycling and exterior services leadership that ultimately produced 42 recommendations. Emory then partnered with Cascadia Consulting Group and Burns & McDonnell in 2016-17 to develop its first Sustainable Materials Management Master Plan. The planning process included the following key elements. An extensive assessment of materials moving through Emory's campuses, including waste audits, physical infrastructure assessments, procurement and design standards review, and waste receiving facility visits.

Data Mapping Academia's Voluntary Commitments to the United Nations' Ocean Conference 2017,"The purpose of this research is to examine academic institutions voluntary commitments to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals as published in the Partnership Data for the Sustainable Development Goals (PD4SDGs) database in 2016. More specifically, this poster seeks to present the geospatial distribution patterns of these commitments, including partner locations. These geospatial patterns serve as a proxy for the growth of shared values, norms, and beliefs necessary for cooperation and thus indicate relative support for the sustainable development goals. While the UN previously conducted a Visualization Competition in July 2017 with this dataset, the winning entry only analyzed project location by ocean basin. This research project expands on the efforts of the Visualization Competition by mapping the geospatial distributions of partner entities from the PD4SDGs dataset by entity classification type. This dataset is poorly structured for this purpose, but key data about 'academic institutions' and 'scientific communities' will be completed prior to the conference. Similar maps will eventually be drawn for other entity types as progress on the restructuring continues, with the goal to ultimately produce an interactive mapping system that allows the user to filter by entity type, goal, and project target location.

After surveying sustainability leaders at the University of Virginia, many also thought that workshops in other areas from videography to behavioral psychology would make them more employable in green careers. During their undergraduate studies, students gain significant experience through involvement in student orgs, internships, class projects, etc. They learn to navigate complex collaborations, lead their peers, and promote their causes - all incredibly valuable skills. Unfortunately though, much of this knowledge is gained through frustrating trial-and-error, and furthermore, these skills are difficult to sum up on a resume. Students at UVA are seeking more focused skills training, and we are starting to answer that call through an event series hosted by the Sustainability Office, the Career Center, and more. The skills that student sustainability leaders desire are wide-ranging, but the vast majority are also ones that can make them more effective advocates for change in their current roles as sustainability catalysts. Mutually beneficial for students, supervisors, and the sustainability movement as a whole, providing more formal skills training seems like a no-brainer.",University of Virginia,4028,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,,,"skill development,career preparedness,change agents,social change",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Dana Schroeder,Sustainability Outreach & Engagement Coordinator,University of Virginia,4028,Christie Julien,,University of Virginia,4028,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Schroeder_2571.pdf,,,

Sustainability in the apparel discipline: The layers of ESRAP,"Social responsibility and sustainable fashion are two topics that have emerged as prominent themes in courses within textiles and apparel curriculums around the globe. As important as these topics and practices are there remains a challenge of how to weave this content into academic curriculum and to relate them directly to actual industry practices. This session will share classroom approaches (projects, findings, and lessons learned) for this integrating sustainability and corporate responsibility into the apparel curriculum. Items presented represent a sampling of projects being initiated by academians who are members of the Educators for Socially Responsible Apparel Practice (ESRAP) organization. Some of these projects include: creating new garments using muslin and fashion fabric scraps from previous apparel design projects (repurposing), designing an internationally focused fashion line that embodies a selected Eco approach (such as zero waste design and slow design), and a service learning project which focused on lengthening the life of garments via a mending and alteration shop, to name a few. Presentation will include physical examples of student work in addition to digital image referencing.

Foundations of Sustainability,"Foundations of Sustainability is an interactive discussion seminar facilitated by the Colgate University Office of Sustainability Green Raider Interns that students may take to engage in conversations about sustainability and receive physical education credit through Colgate University's comprehensive wellness program. Throughout the program students explore current topics in sustainability at Colgate and beyond, with each week focusing on one of the following themes: Foundations of Sustainability, the Material Economy, Environmental Justice, Food, and the Power of One. Students engage with the topic through readings, videos, discussions, and activities to illustrate the themes of each week's lesson. The program is designed to be fun, educational, and interactive. Our goal in providing this course is to create a space in which students can discuss a topic that there is not always a time and place for in this environment. We ultimately hope that students will continue the discussions started in this course with their friends and family and put the principles they learned in the course into action in their daily lives.",Colgate University,4155,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,"internships,courses,wellness",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Ashlea Raemer,,Colgate University,4155,Pamela Gramlich,,Colgate University,4155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Engaged Scholarship with Community Partners: What We Can Learn From our Peers' Greenhouse Gases,"Through the class Sustainability & Climate Action Planning for Local Government at Colgate University, students engaged in community projects, one of which aimed to benchmark the University among its peer institutions in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. The student group found that by normalizing greenhouse gas inventory data across multiple metrics for contextualization it becomes clear which emissions areas a university can improve on. Instead of acting singularly in the world of sustainability, greenhouse gas contextualization encourages emissions reductions as a collective group, thus fostering cohesion in the progression toward a sustainable future. They found that institutions are able to use much more integrative and nuanced ways of targeting emissions when one considers the home institution in the context its peers. Using the benchmarking of Colgate University to its peers as an example, this presentation will display how contextualizing emissions data can be used among colleges and universities as an important emissions reduction tool and will showcase the benefits of using sustainability-related community projects as a platform for engaged scholarship. This presentation will look at the valuable professional and academic learning outcomes that result from working in collaboration with community partners.",Colgate University,4155,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Air & Climate,,,,"community engagement,ghg reporting,emissions reduction",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Pamela Gramlich,,Colgate University,4155,Seamus Crowley,Sustainability Intern,Colgate University,4155,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grow Native - A Plant and Pollinator Garden Catalyzes Engagement and Learning,"Over the past two years a small, inspired group of students, employees, community friends and alums of Brookhaven College (Dallas County Community Colleges) proposed, designed, crowd-funded, and installed a 4,000 square foot native plant garden on campus, all the while seeking broad-based support of this cross-curricular, multi-purpose teaching and learning resource. Discover - as we did - community partners that care, contribute and collaborate. Follow our progress to teach a diverse, multi-generational constituency about the importance of native plants, pollinators and the natural world. And find out how our garden is one link in a chain of state-wide efforts to conserve and protect migrating monarch butterflies. The enthusiasm with which the garden has been embraced by the college and surrounding communities suggests that projects such as this one appeal across a wide spectrum, and may model a way to turn spectators or skeptics into stakeholders in the sustainability journey.",Brookhaven College - DCCCD,4261,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Grounds,Public Engagement,,,"gardens,pollinators,native plants",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Carrie Schweitzer,Director of Sustainability,Brookhaven College - DCCCD,4261,Amy Monroy,Windmill Garden Project Coordinator,Brookhaven College - DCCCD,4261,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Schweitzer_2243.pdf,,,
Sustainable Living: Off-Grid Tiny Hydro Powered House,"One of the major challenges in modern society is providing affordable housing for the everyday person. The next level to this challenge is providing housing that is both affordable and sustainable. To address these challenges we initially set out to build a tiny home that met all the needs of a modern couple. This includes a full kitchen, bathroom, and separate bedroom. Having a hydro-electric station near our tiny house led us to the idea of joining these two sustainability projects. The micro-grid energy storage system will produce DC energy from an irrigation ditch formerly used by a sugar plantation. This project culminates the efforts of students, faculty, and community members. The tiny house and hydro-electric energy production site provides amazing hands-on laboratory experiences for our college's Carpentry, Facilities Maintenance, Electrical Installation, and Sustainable Science Management students. This educational demonstration site fuses multiple sustainability concepts such as: composting toilet, green/garden roof, rainwater collection, grey water collection, tiny living, renewable energy, and an off-grid energy storage system. We hope to advance the discussion locally on how to remove barriers to more sustainable building design and construction. We believe that it is imperative to provide written, academic, policy discussions, and research on this topic. This is an ongoing project that provides actual application of sustainability on many levels.",Kauai Community College,4275,,,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Curriculum,,,,"tiny homes,living labs",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Justin Carvalho,Instructor Coordinator,Kauai Community College,4275,Daniel Erickson,Lecturer,Kauai Community College,4275,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Forming campus collaborations to support student advocacy skills,"The recent Presidential election has inspired a new activism in our students. They want to be heard by not only campus administration, but by local, state and federal representatives, but are unsure of the avenues to take. Different values, religions, races, ethnicities, identities and physical and mental abilities have been threatened and students want to stand up and make a change. The University at Albany Office of Sustainability teamed up with the Office of Multicultural Resource Center, the Gender and Sexuality Resource Center and Office of Diversity and Inclusion to create an intracampus coalition to assist students in this endeavor. The purpose of this coalition is to: 1. Foster citizenship in our students and give them the skills to become good advocates 2. Link our students (and faculty/staff) with resources and local organizations to foster their passions and increase their knowledge 3. Provide students with the tools to be able to be successful outside of the university bubble, and converse civilly and work with those that share differing philosophies Over the course of the semester, the coalition will host various trainings and programming events that will help students, faculty and staff build this skillset for becoming better-engaged citizens. Some of the topics are: 1. Advocacy vs. Activism and the proper way to effectively participate in both 2. Civic Discourse 3. Crafting Quality Arguments 4.

From the Iowa Caucus to the Iowa State House: Strategies for Sustained Civic Engagement,"In 2015-16, leading up to the Iowa caucus and presidential election, Central College focused sustainability education efforts strongly on civic engagement, hosting a mock caucus, debate watch parties, guest speakers, and a public policy theater event. In the lead-up to the Iowa caucus, the college hosted town-hall conversations with presidential candidates and lead candidates tours of LEED buildings and solar arrays. After the 2016 caucus and general election, sustainability leaders representing students, faculty, and staff strategized how to continue civic engagement and political activism. In 2017, Central began a series of lunches, each focused on a specific policy issue at the intersection of environmental and social justice (e.g. refugee policy, water quality, Black Lives Matter, living wage), each led by experts from community organizations. Weekly lunches highlighted concrete skills for political advocacy (e.g. effective letter-writing, talking points for a town hall meeting) and the series culminated with an opportunity for students to visit legislators at the state capitol. In this session, we will share our planning process and approach to engaging the whole campus in identifying topics. We will share challenges and lessons learned, including how to facilitate conversation about contentious issues. Drawing on reflections from students who participated in the series, we will share strategies for connecting sustainability education and political advocacy.",Central College,4371,,,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,"political engagement,civic engagement,politics",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Giselle Bruskewitz,Coordinator of Sustainability Education,Central College,4371,Brian Campbell,Director of Sustainability Education,Central College,4371,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oral History and Sustainability: Campus and Community Engagement Through Student Research in the Humanities,"This session introduces oral history as a tool for students to investigate and influence the cultures of sustainability on campus and in the community. Since 2015, Central College in Pella, Iowa has integrated oral history interviews into course projects, summer programs, one day service events, and long-term community partnerships. Presenters will share these multiple models for engaging the humanities in sustainability-related research, giving attendees the tools to establish oral history projects of their own. In 2015, a team of student and faculty researchers spent a summer investigating the long history of sustainability at Central College, combining archival and oral history research, which continued with more interviews in a fall course, establishing a rich collection of stories on decades of sustainability efforts. In 2016-17, researchers focused on the history of family farms and local food systems, in particular the college's key local suppliers.. Another faculty-student team worked to gather stories of Des Moines high school students who are immigrants, refugees, and/or low income potential first generation college students. In 2017, building on this experience, Central established 'Stories of a Changing Midwest,' a platform to collect oral histories of the region's 'changing people, places, cultures, and climate.'

Implementing an Environmental Sustainability Badge Program: Best Practices for Co-Curricular Learning and Community Engagement,"Integrating environmental sustainability across a community college's curriculum requires more than interest from administration and faculty. Integration needs employees across the entire college capable of communicating, implementing, maintaining and modeling sustainable practices within daily operations. This requires a workforce that understands and applies environmentally sustainable practices specific to their jobs; furthermore, it challenges this workforce to identify synergistic sustainability skills. Central Community College's badge program empowers and rewards all college stakeholders to support, build, and grow sustainability practices across all programs at the institution. With a combination of identified courses and co-curricular experiences, students can be officially awarded a badge on their transcript. These badges verify that the student has various sustainability skills that are applicable in their field, foster movement toward a sustainable future, and are relevant to local, regional, and national employers. Building the badge program has increased the success of grant applications for environmental sustainability projects, connected staff better with faculty, and resulted in better documentation of student involvement and achievement. This presentation will discuss how a pilot badge program has benefited the region and inspired a variety of stakeholders to integrate environmental sustainability across the college and the community.",Central Community College,4372,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,"badges,skill development",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Brent Adrian,Instructor of Communication,Central Community College,4372,Benjamin Newton,Environmental Sustainability Director,Central Community College,4372,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Adrian_2225.pptx,,,
Developing Community Solidarity Through Beekeeping,"This presentation will cover how a college beekeeping course resulted in an informed community of concerned honey bee supporters. Central Community College started a beekeeping course that drew participants from several surrounding counties. Upon investigation of regional beekeeping regulations, it was found that the largest city in the area described honey bees as vermin; as a result, legal beekeeping was questionable. An educational team was created of college and community members to change city policy. The college used mass and social media communication to educate area citizens about the benefits and threats to bees. Such publicity resulted in numerous notifications to the college from concerned citizens wanting feral hives and swarms picked up by trained beekeepers. Local industries such as pest control, landscaping, tree removal, roofing, and house moving became involved in saving, rather than eradicating, honey bees. The local animal control department became involved for crowd control and education. Area scout camps requested presentations and hives. Area schools have expressed interest in educational observation hives, the original beekeeping course has doubled enrollment, and an advanced course has been added. The more informed city government changed regulations due to the educational efforts to allow beekeeping. Following this presentation, a question and answer session will take place to respond to audience input, concerns, and strategy.",Central Community College,4372,,,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,,"bees,pollinators,community engagement",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Brent Adrian,Instructor of Communication,Central Community College,4372,Judy Weston,Community Programming Coordinator,Central Community College,4372,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Adrian_2085.pdf,,,
Using Compost to Seek Green Justice Beyond the Campus,"The University of Arizona Compost Cats is an organization that works to divert organic waste from landfills and converts it into valuable soil amendment for Southern Arizona's arid soils. But the work does not stop there: the Compost Cats are involved in a variety of other justice efforts beyond the UA campus, including a project in partnership with the Arizona State Prison system, which seeks to connect sustainability and higher learning with our oft-forgotten prison population.

"Hall Move out, With a Twist.","This session will review the University of Arizona's Hall Move-Out project. Project goals are to collect sellable goods from students moving out of residence halls and hold a rummage sale before the fall semester starts. The twist entails staffing hall dumpsters and sorting all trash bags before they are put into landfill roll-offs. Due to this bag review, we are able to collect more perishable food items, more recycling and more sellable goods. Beginning May 2017, we are planning to add an off-campus housing pick up program that will increase collection totals. This project helps us to reach and engage with students who do not normally participate in campus sustainability initiatives as well as the community surrounding campus. The interaction affords a moment in which students and community members join to better the campus environment.

Environmental Arts: How Sustainability and Art Can Create Meaningful Community Relationships,"Art in the environment is a constant evolving idea that challenges the notion of how we approach sustainable practices. Using fine arts practices like painting and drawing express creativity that coincide with ideas of sustainability while also utilizing the community aspect. At the University of Arizona, Environmental Arts is a student run committee that uses these elements of art and community to highlight important sustainability topics. One project Environmental Arts completed called 'Just Add Water' demonstrates how important these community relationships are. Collaborating with Tucson High, a local high school, Environmental Arts worked with high school students to create various art inspired by the issue of water scarcity. By hearing lectures from local hydrologists and environmental artists, students had the opportunity to fully understand why water is so important and how to conserve it, especially in Arizona. Using these ideas surrounding the water scarcity topic, high school students created both 2D works, like paintings and drawings, and 3D works, like ceramic vessels and sculptures to express their interpretations. Environmental Arts then collected these works and displayed them in a gallery venue on the University of Arizona campus to both highlight the concepts and present the art students worked on throughout the semester. Creating this sense of community between the university and high school students promotes life long relationships for a better future.",University of Arizona,4465,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,"arts & culture,community partnerships",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Alex Lambert,Student,University of Arizona,4465,Rebecca Van Rhee,,University of Arizona,4465,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5th AASHE Workshop on Research for Sustainability: 'Big Data' for Sustainability Research,"The 21st Century digital revolution greatly expanded data gathering, availability of and access to large data compilations. The technologist and scientific community recognize the significance and the research discoveries that this explosion of data presents. Data documenting global resources, climate change, ecological quality, and social dimensions of civilization are critical to determining the status of humanity and Earth relative to sustainability. 'Big Data' capabilities facilitate effective research on questions of global scale that bear directly on progress toward or retreat from sustainability. Systems thinking and systems solutions require data on inputs, outputs, and transfers among system elements. While this matter crosses disciplinary boundaries, there is clear agreement that we must strive to develop unified models by which data are not merely captured, curated, analyzed and visualized, but also fused in a systematic way to invoke novel outcomes that further advance sustainability. This symposium will bring together scholars, scientists, and designers to examine the possibility of developing a more functional approach to better advance the cause of sustainability through research mining of extensive data compilations. Workshop participants will learn of novel applications of disparate 'big data' compilations and how those data are being used to better understand dynamics of the human-environmental system and prospects for a sustainable future for humanity.",University of Arkansas,4466,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research,,,,,"metrics,databases,data",10/15/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Tahar Messadi,ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR,University of Arkansas,4466,Stephen Boss,Professor Environmental Dynamics & Sustainability,University of Arkansas,4466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Outcomes of Collaborative Learning of Sustainable Building Design and Construction Practices,"In this second paper, the authors present the formative evaluation results from research conducted during Fall 2016 at Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design at the University of Arkansas. The outcomes of this collaborative learning project between three groups of students with respective backgrounds in Architecture, Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering, revealed measurable learning improvement in their understanding of the design and construction for sustainability. Each of these groups was enrolled in a separate course and came together to produce reports for the resolution of three specific design and construction challenges pertinent to sustainability in new building construction, namely the Vol Walker Hall Extension. In reference to the collaborative learning environment 'Eco-construction' summarized in the previous paper, this framework has been used to support sustainable building design and construction. This project is part of an NSF IUSE Grant, Collaborative Research: Strategies for Learning: Augmented Reality and Collaborative Problem-Solving for Building Sciences. The project builds on collaborative problem solving strategies and collaborative learning theory to understand how to improve student learning outcomes. This effort will be continued through Fall of 2017, with the next phase of work consisting of the implementation of strategies for learning, involving Augmented Reality with Collaborative Problem-Solving for Building Sustainability.",University of Arkansas,4466,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Buildings,Curriculum,,,building design,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Tahar Messadi,ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR,University of Arkansas,4466,WINIFRED NEWMAN,ARCHITECTURE DEPARTMENT HEAD,University of Arkansas,4466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_NEWMAN_2518.pdf,,,
Collaborative Studio Re-Imagining Wood Design and Construction,"In the face of new and shifting demands for sustainable practices imposed upon the building industry and the world of design, wood is gaining popularity as a biodegradable and renewable material. In North America, 95% of homes are built with this material, yet challenges remain to make wood viable, common, or attractive for all building types. Furthermore, the social calls for better buildings with minimal or zero carbon footprint are profoundly re-shaping the attitude of the architect and designer towards environmental consideration in design. In this conference session, we share the pedagogical approach deployed to engage architecture and interior design students in a team collaboration directed at the investigation, exploration and application of wood in the design of an academic live-learn residential hall. The current leadership at Fay Jones School of Architecture is active on many fronts, promoting the use of wood across the campus, and in the state of Arkansas. Among them are the curricular incorporation of wood in design education, the privileged role attributed to wood in new building construction, and the engagement of research targeting this material. This session will trace and reflect on the development, implementation, and products of a collaborative studio in support of the School's initiative to develop and employ sustainable wood technologies, and to promote opportunities for achieving a responsible employment of Arkansas' natural wood resources.",University of Arkansas,4466,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Air & Climate,Buildings,Design,,"wood,construction",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Tahar Messadi,ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR,University of Arkansas,4466,Kimberley Furlong,"Assistant Professor, Interior Design",University of Arkansas,4466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Climatepedia: A Climate Action Network for the Nation,"Climatepedia was founded by undergraduate students in 2011 by UCLA students. It is now an emerging 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with chapters at UC Irvine, UCLA, and Yale University. Our organization has a mission to communicate the risks and solutions of a changing climate in a simple and reliable way. Our main project - the Tyndall Petition - is the largest climate petition of its kind. The Tyndall Petition provides transparency to climate experts by featuring them in profiles that show their research expertise. To grow the petition, Climatepedia is branching out to universities all over the country through a student certificate program. Due to lack of federal support for climate action, it's more important than ever to provide a standardized campus infrastructure across the nation for students to engage in climate action. Our student certificate program provides structure and guidance for student leaders to become climate ambassadors. Campuses who have students in our certificate program can institutionalize this program as part of their 'sustainability resume,' which facilitates the integration of sustainability into campus culture. The localized efforts of Climatepedia students at each campus comprise a larger national network of leaders in sustainability who can collaborate with each other and link their individual universities. Our program provides a network that serves as a launch pad for other climate action projects.","University of California, Irvine",4502,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Air & Climate,Public Engagement,,,"students,student organizations,climate commitments",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Kimberly Duong,Executive Director of Scientific Operations,"University of California, Irvine",4502,Gianna Lum,Climatepedia,"University of California, Irvine",4502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Duong_2492.pdf,,,
The Ripple Effect: Taking Hydroponic Growing From Missouri State to 32 Other Schools and Eventually the World,"What began as an effort to showcase herbs grown on campus has already grown to 896 grow towers across the country, with an annual produce yield of 35,000lbs, a produce cost savings of $265,000.00, and saving 177,000 gallons of water annually over traditional growth methods. We are now bringing this technology to Haiti to help 350 orphans, 2,000 students and their caretakers conquer the devastating hunger insecurity that plagues Haitians living in the poorest country in the Americas. While Haiti is in a tropical climate where crops grow easily, crop theft is a major problem and alternative growing methods allows not only additional productions, but crop security, as well as a reduction in water and labor usage.

Applied learning for sustainability projects: Developing high impact student-community collaborations,"Applied learning opportunities, from internships, to community-based learning courses to student research provide exceptional training for students in addressing complex sustainability challenges. These endeavors are mostly designed to optimize the student's experience, and place a secondary emphasis on the sustainability outcomes-positive real-world changes-produced as a result of these engagements. This workshop will discuss ways how to design projects that offer students a rich learning experience and contribute impactful to change in the community. To this end, the workshop will combine practitioner knowledge, case studies and relevant concepts from sustainability and education literature to outline three principles for building applied learning programs that can deliver on sustainability outcomes and do so at scale. These programs unlock opportunities for students to grapple with complex sustainability challenges while at the same time making measurable progress on those issues. Participants will walk away with initial strategies for approaching applied learning for sustainability at their college or university and a strong understanding of the concepts, methods and approaches compiled in the AASHE guide for applied learning for sustainability projects to support their strategies at home.",Portland State University,2515,Arizona State University,4531,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,"applied learning,community engagement",10/15/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Fletcher Beaudoin,Assistant Director,Portland State University,2515,Katja Brundiers,Research Assistant Professor,Arizona State University,4531,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arizona State University's Laboratory Standard and Design Guide,"Laboratory ventilation and conditioning on university campuses can be responsible for one quarter or more of greenhouse gas emissions, so climate neutrality will be difficult without dramatic gains in efficiency while maintaining high safety standards. Research laboratories have traditionally been designed to operate between 8-12 air changes per hour (ACH) throughout the entire facility 24/7. The needs of present and future researchers are not always known at the onset of construction. This drives design that is too conservative from a safety standpoint, wasting resources and energy without any real benefit. We recently updated the Arizona State University (ASU) Laboratory Standard and Design Guide to both maintain a safe environment and require 6 and 4 ACH in laboratories, during times when labs are occupied and unoccupied respectively. We encourage design professionals to explore the latest technologies and approaches for optimizing performance and providing safe and reliable systems that also conserve energy. When laboratories are equipped with demand-controlled ventilation and air monitoring systems, ACH can be reduced to 4 and 2 during those times.

Food Security Initiatives at Arizona State University,"3 student leaders sharing their efforts in food security initiatives at ASU: SAHC/Campus Kitchen Gleaning: Student Anti-Hunger Coalition, a student led initiative beginning in January 2017, implements programs to eliminate food insecurity across the ASU campuses and the community. Campus Kitchen is a program currently set up across the east of the country. The mission of the program: eliminate food waste and eliminate food insecurity. Left-over food is gleaned from the local community and on-campus cafeterias. Meals are then prepared and served by students and volunteers for those who are struggling with food insecurity. Pitchfork Food Pantry: Pitchfork Pantry is a student organization established on April 13, 2016 in order to address food insecurity at ASU and further research regarding hunger on campus. It currently operates underneath the SAHC at 2 of the 5 ASU locations and provides nutritious, nonperishable food items to students. Borderlands Food Bank: Our alliance with Borderlands Food Bank began in the Fall of 2015. The organization is responsible for diverting fresh produce that would normally end up in landfills due to surplus or minor cosmetic imperfections. Through student-led efforts, ASU is now distributing fresh produce to community members and students at 4 ASU campuses at least once a semester. A $10 donation for up to 60 pounds of nutritious produce eases the financial burden of individuals in lower socioeconomic classes or those within a food desert.",Arizona State University,4531,,,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Wellbeing & Work,,,,"food security,students",10/15/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Kaysey England,,Arizona State University,4531,Rebecca Bender,Undergraduate Student,Arizona State University,4531,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Institutional Boundaries: Creating Clarity in a Time of Complex Third-Party Partnerships,"When was the last time you thought about your 'institutional boundaries' - the first credit in AASHE STARS? As higher education institutions continue to expand and evolve through innovative third-party partnerships - the complexity in defining their boundaries grows. This session will walk attendees through the experience of a major research university in comprehensively reviewing its institutional boundaries for sustainability reporting. We will review the international and national standards followed; explain the process used and stakeholders engaged; review the definitions, report, and decision tree with attendees and outline the impact the effort had on reporting. Have you ever asked the question 'should we report the building that was built by someone else on our land, that we lease from them and then sub-lease some of the space within to others?' We will give one answer and provide a clear outline of the steps taken to reach that conclusion.",Arizona State University,4531,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Buildings,,,,"STARS,sustainability reporting",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Corey Hawkey,Assistant Director,Arizona State University,4531,Mick Dalrymple,"Director, University Sustainability Practices",Arizona State University,4531,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Hawkey_2631.pdf,,,
Ten Years of Including Wellness in the Sustainability Model,"Bemidji State University's Sustainability Office created a unique model for sustainability that includes a wellness component. The mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical health of every person matters. Reducing anxiety, eating good food, getting enough sleep, and utilizing a stand-up desk are all emphasized as a component of sustainability. Attending Native American powwows, listening to music, and creating art are connected to a sustainable vision for the future. The model also references the local Native American culture's Creation story to define the environment and lay the foundation for protecting Mother Earth. In this session, the Sustainability Director and Assistant Sustainability Director will describe the model and go into depth with several unique projects the Sustainability Office has been involved in that connect to the model.

Rapid Response: The South Carolina Floods Research Initiative,"In October 2015, South Carolina experienced an unprecedented flood. It was immediately clear that the state would be forever changed by a natural disaster that ravaged rural, urban and suburban communities, ruined crops just as they were nearing readiness for harvest, destroyed businesses, took lives and compromised vital infrastructure. It seemed no one was left untouched by the devastation. Remarkably, rather than descend into despair, South Carolinians banded together, supporting neighbors, friends and family through efforts that continue today. The University of South Carolina took part in this effort in many ways, one of which was through a rapid-response, research to practice funding program. The brainchild of USC Vice President for Research, Prakash Nagarkatti, this special effort funded flood research projects that would contribute to our understanding of what happened and to the future well-being of our state. Hours after USC resumed normal operations, the Office of Research launched this effort, issuing an RFP throughout the USC System. Within a week, dozens of faculty from a wide variety of disciplines submitted proposals. Another week later, a review committee awarded funding to 34 research projects in areas from communications to infrastructure impacts. This rapid response allowed 80+ researchers from 9 subject categories to begin gathering data within two weeks of the floods, enabling them to capture even the most perishable data.",University of South Carolina,4756,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Coordination & Planning,,,,"flood response,disaster response",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Elizabeth Renedo,Research Communications Manager,University of South Carolina,4756,Namita Koppa,"Assistant Director, Office of Sustainability",University of South Carolina,4756,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Renedo_2737.pdf,0830_Renedo_2737_1013_121453.pdf,,
Campus Energy Savings S.P.A.R.K. a Student-Led Recycling Revolution,"Over the past decade, Kutztown University in Pennsylvania has continually worked to retrofit and upgrade campus buildings and services to make them more energy efficient with the help of NORESCO, an energy services company. Part of the contract focused on reducing residential student energy waste and improving recycling behavior. This initial focus on recycling was augmented with a recycling audit and served as a catalyst for the creation of the recycling group. The Students Promoting Acts of Recycling at Kutztown University (S.P.A.R.K.) is the student group that has made a significant impact on the campus culture with respect to recycling and waste reduction over the past several years. This presentation will highlight how the group was formed and how they have continued to effectively engage students campus-wide in their recycling efforts. Some of their activities include an Annual Fashion Trashion Show that features styles students create with used materials collected on campus, a Water Bottle Drive where bottles are diverted from the waste stream and collected in a visible campus location to promote student awareness, and the Weigh Your Waste Food Week that involves the collection, weight calculation, then exhibition of dining hall food waste to make students more aware of the consequences of their choices.

Greeks Going Green: How and Why to Foster a Lasting Green Greek Life,"Greek life has a legacy of producing the change makers, leaders, and power brokers of the future. Consequently, educating Greeks about sustainability, and leading them to adopt sustainability measures as college students, should help our planet in the coming decades. However, weak philanthropic yields, intangible returns, and apathy can make the long term viability of most Greek sustainability projects a challenge, and the ultimate path to deep sustainability engagement an arduous one. In this session, attendees will: -Meet with others who want to make the Greek system a leader in the green movement at their universities, and an exemplar for universities nationwide; -successes and challenges with student-led sustainability initiatives using case studies from C of C; -Discuss funding options through Green Funds, Greek Councils and national organizations; -Learn about exciting national-level initiatives to advance sustainability awareness and leadership in the Greek community; and -Walk away with 'shovel-ready' sustainability programs and strategies for making sure that Greek Sustainability efforts last beyond their time on campus.

Trends in climate change mitigation strategies. Which institutions are meeting their greenhouse gas reduction targets and why.,"In the last decade nearly 500 colleges and universities in North America have publicly declared their intention to combat climate change by reaching carbon neutrality. Of those, 325 have committed to achieve neutrality before 2050. Today we can look back at the last ten years and analyze which institutions are on track and which have gone off the rails. In this discussion Ameresco's Climate Change Initiatives group will present our analysis of institutional enablers such as leadership, funding, governance, student empowerment and local legislation to identify trends in achieving incremental greenhouse gas reduction targets. Are there key ingredients to the 'secret sauce'?

How to Drive the Transformation Change Needed in your Institution to Achieve Climate Neutrality,"Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, Western society has been built on the use of fossil fuels. In fact, energy consumption per capita is higher in Canada and the United States than other large OECD nations. Since lavish use of fossil fuels is so widespread, transitioning colleges and universities to true climate neutrality by 2050 or earlier will be exceedingly difficult. Institutions are typically driven by incremental strategies on a quarterly and annual horizon - this approach simply will not work for transformational change. A big, audacious vision need to be embedded in an organization's culture reaching far deeper than the political, social, or typical work-related whims. In this presentation Ameresco's Climate Change Initiatives team will: Identify of the characteristics and differences between incremental and transformational strategies; Provide examples of transformational projects our customers have endeavored to significantly reduce their reliance on fossil fuels; Describe partnership-based approach to create integrated, systems-based, Climate Neutrality/GHG Reduction Roadmaps","Ameresco, Inc.",6331,,,,,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,,,,climate neutrality,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Mark Wilhelm,Sustainability and Climate Neutrality Consultant,"Ameresco, Inc.",6331,Tara Haviland,,"Ameresco, Inc.",6331,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Wilhelm_2760.pdf,,,

Students in the Food Movement: A Vision Deeper than the Problem,"Even as the campus sustainability movement has grown, the issues in our food system have continued to deepen. Federal policy is failing to protect small farmers, while family fishermen are being pushed out by policies privatizing the ocean. Food insecurity is on the rise on college campuses, and immigrant workers that our food system depends on are being threatened with deportation. We are facing a moment of crisis, and also a moment of opportunity. Now is the time to shift the public narrative about food in this country. We have an opportunity to raise up the solutions that students, farmers, workers, and communities are putting forward, and to challenge the barriers that stand in their way. What would it look like to have a vision as deep as the problem, and a clear strategy to get to that vision? This workshop will explore how the campus sustainability movement can rise to the challenges facing our food system today. Through the lens of social movements, we will discuss the unique role that students can play in advocating for a just and sustainable food system.

"A Co Curricular Course about Sustainability, Leadership, Civic Engagement, Integrity and Interculturality","As part of UDEM´s Formative Model, every student has to take 4 co-curricular courses. From these 4 courses, one is mandatory and they can choose the other 3. META is the mandatory course, and it's focused in Sustainability, Civic Engagement, Integrity, Interculturality and Leadership. Also important is that all students take the Sulitest as part of the sustainability module, this way we can assess how much they know about sustainability and after they can have feedback on how to live a more sustainable life. Another thing that is important for this course is that, as group project, students have to select an NGO to work with, and by the end of the semester they finish with a weekend activity with the community chosen. All this social service hours and impacts are very important to count and also hard to do it. To do this we have implemented an online platform that compiles it all. ""Ser Más Manos' its an online platform powered by GivePulse, this way every student has an online profile where can capture all the volunteering work they do. Will all this tools we can assure our students every action counts and matters, and it may seem little what they do but the cumulative impact is greater. The Course META is a catalyst for our students and at the end of the course they realize how they can have a positive impact in the community and in the environment; and how working together for the same end can create a better world.

California's Campuses Light the Way to a Clean Energy Future: Best Practices in Solar Project Planning,"Until recently, the majority of solar PV capacity in the US has been installed in California. As new states emerge as leaders in solar-friendly policies, decision makers at campuses across the country are becoming more aware of the host of benefits provided by this renewable energy source. To support decision makers in executing successful solar projects, representatives from SunPower will share the best practices learned from partnering with five campuses in the University of California system, which has pledged for all campuses to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025. This presentation will highlight several campuses, including UC Merced, which, as the newest campus in the UC system, can incorporate high sustainability standards into all facilities projects (e.g., new buildings on campus must achieve a minimum of LEED Gold certification, new roofs must be able to accommodate solar panels). Planners at UC Davis capitalized on the versatility of solar applications by installing a ground-mounted solar power plant, and chose high-efficiency SunPower panels for the rooftop and carport solar systems for the UC Davis West Village, the nation's largest planned net zero-energy housing community.",SunPower Corp,7328,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Coordination & Planning,,,,"solar,renewable energy,regional focus",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Bruce Dickinson,"Director, Public & Education",SunPower Corp,7328,Elaine Westcott,"Marketing Specialist, Education",SunPower Corp,7328,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045_Westcott_2949.pdf,,,

Power in Numbers: Collaborative Solar Procurement in Virginia,"The Council of Independent Colleges in Virginia (CICV) will provide an overview of the first collaborative procurement of on-campus solar energy in Virginia. This session will help participants understand their options for onsite (as well as offsite) renewables and opportunities to build coalitions with peer institutions to take bold action in achieving renewable energy and carbon reduction goals. CICV's Solar Market Pathways project created a diverse statewide coalition of 15 private colleges, ranging from Tidewater to the mountains of far Southwestern Virginia, to plan and implement onsite solar strategies for their campuses. The colleges leveraged a replicable collaborative solar procurement framework to pool their purchasing power in order to secure better pricing and terms, simplify the procurement process, and move along the learning curve together. It is the outreach and educational components that make the CICV project truly unique. The project team hosted workshops and biannual conferences to educate hundreds of stakeholders and policymakers about the benefits of renewable energy and address local policy barriers to solar project development. This community engagement helped to overcome long-held skepticism of solar energy and ultimately strengthen the Commonwealth's solar market. Students were engaged through several opportunities along the way, including real life analyses related to electricity markets, environmental policy, and utility ratemaking.",3Degrees,7198,Council of Independent Colleges in Virginia,7715,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Investment & Finance,Public Engagement,,,"solar,renewable energy,collaboratives",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Tyler Espinoza,Monterey Institute of International Studies,3Degrees,7198,Lora Toothman,"Project Manager, Solar Market Pathways",Council of Independent Colleges in Virginia,7715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Energy Security, Resilience, and Cost Savings: Solar Can Do More Than Save the Planet","Installing a solar PV array on campus is one way campuses across the country are working toward their climate and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals. But with the cost of solar steadily declining a variety of financing options, there are so many benefits to solar beyond GHG. This panel will share why solar makes sense for reasons beyond reducing your carbon footprint including: sound financial investments, bolstering campus and community relationships, and attracting students. Learn from the Midwest Renewable Energy Association (MREA), working to demonstrate that solar is an investment worth making for endowment offices and outside investors. Along with developing a new financial tool that visualizes PPA, direct purchase, debt financing, and operating leases, MREA is helping university endowments to invest in solar and proving that they can get good financial return. The Council of Independent Colleges in Virginia (CICV) is emphasizing ways local colleges and universities can strengthen existing partnerships and develop new ones by helping communities become solar ready and explore opportunities for joint procurement.

Bridging the Gap: Strategies for Sustainability-Athletics Partnerships,"Expanding sustainability goals and programming to include collegiate athletics provides opportunities for unique engagements across the campus community. Doing so requires building relationships and coordinating cross-pollination between campus sustainability professionals, athletics staff, and the campuses media rights-owners that manage in-game visibility and messaging. This activity will build on the networking and coordination outcomes compiled at the Pac-12 Sports Sustainability Conference held in June 2017. That event is focused on detailing the pathways across these disparate stakeholder and staff groups required to field sports sustainability efforts that engage broader campus sustainability participation. During this networking meeting, attendees will learn about existing sports sustainability programs and initiatives; share challenges faced when developing these initiatives; and discuss strategies to bridge the gap between sustainability and athletics department in order to achieve greater campus goals and engage the campus community in an exciting and effective way.",University of Colorado Boulder,2130,Green Sports Alliance,7764,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,"athletics,on-campus collaboration",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,David Newport,"Director, Environmental Center",University of Colorado Boulder,2130,Rahul Devaskar,Membership Manager,Green Sports Alliance,7764,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1645_Devaskar_2198.pptx,,,
How Deferred Maintenance can be Your Climate Action Plan Ally,Is your institution reluctant to start a green fund due to competing priorities such as deferred maintenance backlog? Come hear how Dickinson College has carefully identified energy-saving and carbon-reducing deferred maintenance projects into their Climate Action Plan and Green Revolving Loan Fund program. The college's journey towards this CAP funding strategy commenced when bad cost and performance projections for a TRIGEN project collided with the completion of a campus-wide Facilities Condition Assessment. These lemons were turned into lemonade when the idea emerged to shift funding from the hindered TRIGEN project towards projects on the Facilities Conditions Assessment that would yield greater financial and environmental returns while addressing deferred maintenance eradication objectives.,Dickinson College,3185,Stone House Group,7849,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Investment & Finance,,,Facilities Management,"deferred maintenance,climate action plans",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Kenneth Shultes,AVP for College Sustainability and Facilities Planning,Dickinson College,3185,Larry Eighmy,Managing Principal,Stone House Group,7849,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Getting to Zero: Integrating Carbon Neutrality Planning with a Campus Utility Master Plan at a Small Liberal Arts College,"This presentation will cover how a small liberal arts college undertook an integrated Campus Utility Master Plan and Net Zero Carbon Strategy. It will explore how the Director of Sustainability built buy-in with Facilities, Finance, and faculty to partner on this ambitious project. We cover scope, engaging consultants, outcomes, challenges, and next steps. In June 2016, the college began working to achieve three main institutional goals: 1. Become a resilient campus able to operate in 'island mode' during a utility black out 2. Continue reducing GHG emissions to reach the carbon neutrality by 2035 3. Develop an integrated campus utility master plan to account for 30% growth in facilities over 15 years To achieve this, consultants conducted overlapping studies in fall 2016 to analyze campus infrastructure, deferred/cycle/modernization maintenance needs and energy projects to identify upgrades to meet future needs sustainably. The process included an Energy Capital Investment Plan, a Facilities Condition Assessment, an Alternative/Renewable Energy Study and Incentives Research. While these components could be stand-alone studies, the synergy doing them concurrently has allowed the College to create a comprehensive strategy that will save millions of dollars over time. Outcomes include plans for a 1MW CHP to provide centralized standby power for resiliency, $3 million in efficiency upgrades, and integration of planning to address the deferred maintenance backlog.",Swarthmore College,3879,Stone House Group,7849,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,,,"climate neutrality,master plans",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Aurora Winslade,Director of Sustainability,Swarthmore College,3879,Larry Eighmy,Managing Principal,Stone House Group,7849,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beyond Excuses: Banning Bottled Water on Your Campus,"Over 100 North American universities have enacted policies banning bottled water and promoting tap water as a more preferable choice. This workshop will outline the steps of banning bottled water, applying an 'unfreezing, change and refreezing' process (Lewin). Featuring case studies from two Washington universities that have created a coalition aimed at developing plans based on this model, this workshop will offer diverse and comprehensive perspectives as well as best practices for application. Removing bottled water from campuses is a complicated process requiring attention to topics like student involvement, infrastructure, purchasing, and behavior change. To enact a change that strays so far from accepted norms will also require a commitment to the environmental, social justice, and human rights arguments surrounding this issue to create comprehensive buy-in. Together, applied with concepts of change management theory, responsible water management is possible in any institution.",Eastern Washington University,7933,,,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Coordination & Planning,Water,,,bottled water,10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Scott Buck,Transportation Manager,Eastern Washington University,7933,Erik Budsberg,Sustainability Coordinator,Eastern Washington University,7933,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Buck_2121.pptx,,,

Dollars are Flying out of Your Green Fund! Does That Equal Success?,"Actively managing a campus green fund in its social, environmental, and economic aspects is an essential component to producing intentional results and optimizing its impact. Since its inception in 2011, Texas A&M University's Aggie Green Fund has granted approximately $1.7 million to campus environmental improvements. While the fiscal and environmental impacts of green funds often take center stage, equally important is the story of how, as both an organization and a funding source, the Aggie Green Fund has evolved to better respond to campus needs. The presenters will share important context on the Aggie Green Fund, from its student initiative origins to key programmatic and management changes in recent years, allowing participants to take away lessons from both the stumbles and triumphs of the fund. Throughout the discussion, participants will engage in interactive surveys to help highlight common pitfalls and best practices. Presentation topics covered will include improving the engagement, impact, and effectiveness of a green fund's board, providing funding and support that is responsive to student and campus needs, building campus networks and strengthening green fund outreach, and improving the effectiveness of funded projects.",Texas A&M University,7982,,,,,,,,,,,,,Investment & Finance,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,"green funds,assessment",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Lara Hendrickson,Sustainability Operations Coordinator,Texas A&M University,7982,Kelly Wellman,Sustainability Director,Texas A&M University,7982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Hendrickson_2366.pdf,,,
The Road to Gold: Sustainability Success REALLY IS Written in the STARS,"The Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS) has become a vital tool for Texas A&M University. Over time, we have learned how to better leverage STARS to improve sustainability performance and make our university stronger in solidarity. This presentation is an update from our 2015 AASHE session where we discussed how initially completing STARS and then letting it drift into the ether until it was time to resubmit caused us to lose momentum. To be more effective, we began using STARS for continuous improvement and set a campus-wide goal to achieve Gold by 2018. The results of this method speak for themselves as we achieved Gold two years ahead of schedule and have valuable advice for both STARS rookies and veterans. Our discussion will include key strategies such as shifting from a three-year reporting cycle to an annual cycle, conducting a gap analysis, improving stakeholder communication, and expanding our STARS Breakfast into a Sustainability Awards Banquet. Finally, we will discuss how we navigated the bumps and bruises encountered along the way and then invite the audience to share their own STARS tales.",Texas A&M University,7982,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,"STARS,goal setting,gap analysis,planning,sustainability reporting,change management",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Ben Kalscheur,Sustainability Assistant Manager,Texas A&M University,7982,Kelly Wellman,Sustainability Director,Texas A&M University,7982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045_Kalscheur_2847.pdf,,,
"Short, Sweet, and Powerful: Student Engagement through Campus Tabling Campaigns","An important part of creating a culture of sustainability on a college campus is successful campus engagement. Attaining this can be difficult for many reasons, such as lack of student knowledge or interest, lack of university resources, and lack of staff support. Through our experiences, we have found that students like freebies, especially if they are quality items. Though most can agree free things draw a crowd, it is not sustainable to hand out low quality items without a purpose. At Texas A&M University, our two flagships events are Campus Sustainability Day and Campus Earth Day. On these days, we lead a tabling campaign, collaborating with student environmental and social sustainability groups and campus stakeholders, in a major campus plaza. There, we use activities and messages to have fun engaging wit students who pass through and hook them in by providing opportunities to earn prizes such as sustainably sourced T-shirts. These tabling campaigns have been very successful for getting students interested in sustainability topics and learning more about campus sustainability organizations. We will share the key elements that lead to us having a successful outreach event as well as the elements that did not with the AASHE community. We hope our lessons learned help participants successfully engage with students on their campuses.",Texas A&M University,7982,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,"campus tabling,events",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Blythe Payne,Intern,Texas A&M University,7982,Ben Kalscheur,Sustainability Assistant Manager,Texas A&M University,7982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New game, new rules: Organising for Sustainability post-Trump and Brexit","Following the Brexit vote, and the election of President Donald Trump, there is widespread concern amongst young people and students around the world on the stance our political leaders are taking on global affairs, equality, climate change and social justice.

A model of partnership between private sector and public universities in Brazil: investment in within campus infrastructure.,"The project proposes the development of a public-private partnership to raise funds for Brazil's net of public universities, nowadays with very narrow budgets, to invest in within campus infrastructure for sustainable energy generation and/or energetic efficiency. Today there are 112 public universities in Brazil and according to the model proposed they would be individually open to sign contracts with one (or more) private sector companies. In the model, the private party funds, operates and assumes the financial and operational risks in the venture. The government in the other hand would support the initiative by providing subsidies and/or tax breaks to the private investors. In the methodology presented, the private sponsor provides resources for alternative energy generation (for example, solar panels in parking areas) and/or energetic efficiency within the public university campus' space. The financial surplus resulted from the energy saved would constitute a fund which could only be applied on the universities' professors, students and faculty members training, research and/or education. We find this model a way of leveraging the campus's infrastructure to expand the main purpose of the university with today's budget bindings and constraints: education, research and professional training.",Federal University of Rio de Janeiro,8290,Santa Catarina State University,8289,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Public Engagement,,,,"green infrastructure,Brazil,partnerships",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Bruno Zanotto Vigna,Student,Federal University of Rio de Janeiro,8290,Adriano Lebsa Weber,Student,Santa Catarina State University,8289,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_LebsaWeber_2926.pdf,,,

Saying No and Saying Yes: The Strategy of Campus Climate Activism,"With the dramatic change in Washington DC policy towards climate, environment and sustainability, there has been a major upswing in campus activism. How can this student activism be most effective? This session facilitates a conversation among participants about the medium-run strategy and the short-run tactics students can pursue to build support for campus, local, state and national government, and business action to cut global warming pollution. Underlying strategy must be a theory of change. Facilitated by a student climate organizer and a professor who has been a long-time observer and supporter of the student climate movement, participants will work in small groups to (1) identify their theory of change; (2) share the major initiatives underway at their schools; (3) discuss the strategic value of those tactics; (4) and walk away with opportunities to better align tactics with strategy.",Bard College,3514,Our Climate,8294,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Air & Climate,,,,"activism,climate action,students,political engagement",10/15/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Eban Goodstein,Director,Bard College,3514,Page Atcheson,Director,Our Climate,8294,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Using the Diffusion of Innovation Theory to Assess Student Involvement,"The reasoning behind becoming involved in topics of sustainability often vary from person to person. We've done a little thinking and found that, like most movements, the Diffusion of Innovation Theory can be applied to ours. There tend to be three different groups: the Greens, the Sprouts, and the Browns. The Greens are the innovators and early adopters. These are the people who have a 'sustainably minded' attitude and generally go out of their way to take action. The Sprouts, or the early and late majority, have the right mindset and attitude but often experience a barrier to action. Finally, the Browns are the group with the attitudes that do not align with a sustainable mindset, preventing them from taking action. This is a laggard attitude. The UMD Office of Sustainability has been working on trying to incorporate this theory into our different projects and events. We've found that our programming is frequently geared toward the Greens and the stronger Sprouts. How do we become involved in events and programming that reaches across the curve and successfully reaches the Browns? At the same time, how do we keep the Greens and Sprouts engaged? How do we 'grow' the Sprouts enough that they will independently 'fertilize' their peers with a Brown attitude? Based on this model, we have found ourselves reassessing the formatting and content of almost everything we do.","University of Minnesota, Duluth",0018,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,"assessment,students,campus culture",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Madelaine Sinclair,Sustainability Assistant,"University of Minnesota, Duluth",0018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ReUseIt Room: Shifting the Way the Campus Thinks About Waste,"As a non-residential community college, Harper College wanted to find a program equivalent to university move out waste reduction programs. Move out waste programs have great potential to save money and reduce waste sent to the landfill. With the lack of residential-type move out material to collect and redistribute, Harper College turned to its employees and began capturing unwanted office supplies to redistribute to other employees on campus. This talk explores the development of Harper's ReUseIt Room, an office supply exchange space that has successfully shifted the way the campus thinks about waste. The idea for the ReUseIt Room came from a creative dialogue about how to adapt a program that was otherwise irrelevant to the college into a program that would fit the college's unique needs. Participants will be prompted to think out of the box, using creativity to make an impact. The ReUseIt Room concept can be applied to any size university, college, community/technical college or business.",Harper College,0023,,,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,"move-in & move-out,office supplies,reuse,",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Amy Bandman,Sustainability Coordinator,Harper College,0023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Bandman_2221.pdf,,,
Bridging the Gap Between Economic Viability and Environmental Sustainability with Solar on University Campuses,"Over the past two years, University of Minnesota students, staff, and faculty have collaborated with solar and financial consultants to encourage the University of Minnesota to invest in solar energy. This presentation documents the journey that University of Minnesota students, staff and faculty underwent as they worked to demonstrate to University leadership that solar energy is not only environmentally responsible but also economically advantageous. Ultimately, this work resulted in the University of Minnesota investing in 6 MW of solar energy through direct installations of on-site solar and subscriptions to community solar gardens. With support from the U.S. Department of Energy's SunShot Initiative and the Midwest Renewable Energy Association (MREA), University of Minnesota has also produced a campus roadmap to guide other higher education institutions interested in investing in solar. During this panel, participants will learn about the process that the University of Minnesota undertook to engage students, identify potential solar investment opportunities on and off campus, evaluate funding mechanisms, and understand the economic, political, technical, and ecological aspects of solar investment. Presentations will be followed by 20 minutes of Q&A and discussion with panel participants.","University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",0032,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Campus Engagement,Investment & Finance,,,"solar,on-campus collaboration",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Megan Butler,Research Assistant,"University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",0032,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Butler_2743.pdf,,,
Sustunes! How to Plan Your own Sustainability Concert on Campus,"As interdisciplinary as the field of sustainability is, more often than not, we see representation of the scientific, architectural and policy fields. Although these fields are important, music and art are also crucial in representing the expressive components of sustainability. A student's passion for music forged the idea of combining art, the environment, and our human connection to it. Music has a power. A power to bring people together while fostering dialogue about the world around us. For two years, the University of Minnesota has hosted 'Sustunes', an environmentally-themed concert that invites students from multiple disciplines- the arts, sciences, humanities, etc-to share their perspectives, as well as their personal connections to nature. Over 18 student groups participated in the evening event, sharing information about their activities on campus, as well as how to make a difference in the campus climate. The event was zero-waste, which means only organics and recyclables were collected in order to minimize the event's footprint. Keeping in mind that the goal of the event is making connections in an inviting, relaxed atmosphere, anyone is welcome-kids, university staff, undergrads, post grads- to attend and enjoy the multifaceted fronts of sustainability. Come learn about our event planning process for Sustunes and find out how you can host an event like this on your campus!

Designing Diverse Online Learning Environments as Laboratories for Connecting Across Difference,"How can community college online learning environments help motivate students to connect across differences and develop capacities as change-agents for a healthier world? Drawing from her experience teaching online humanities and philosophy courses at highly diverse inner-city community colleges, the author offers her framework of facilitating online learning communities that mimic ecological or 'living' systems. Based on her doctoral research that utilized transformative learning theory, ecology, systems theory, and related schools of thought, the author addresses several considerations in the design of online environments that nurture 'living systems awareness.' These include: Utilizing nature's pattern language ('living systems principles') in learning experience design; Intentionally designing for congruency across multiple level of learning with special consideration of learning environment, rhythm and flow, and expressive ways of knowing; Designing learning environments that nurture a quality of heartfelt care, peer-to-peer encouragement and mutual support. Having experienced living systems awareness on multiple levels, learners are more likely to develop capacities to perceive, understand, and love the world as a highly diverse living system and therefore to take action as change-agents for a healthier world.",Peralta Community Colleges District Office,0393,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Diversity & Affordability,,,,online learning,10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Barbara Widhalm,Instructor,Peralta Community Colleges District Office,0393,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Widhalm_2825.pdf,,,
Searching for the Higher Ed Context in the Analysis of Green Building Costs and Benefits,"Green building certification on campuses is relatively new. When determining the financial feasibility of a certified green building at an Institution of Higher Education (IHE), the full building lifecycle perspective is important to consider. This presentation first provides a background on campus sustainable development and green building rating systems. It then reviews the studies that have addressed the upfront green premium and down the line green building operating costs. Lastly, deficiencies in the studies are highlighted as well as future research recommendations in order to cure these deficiencies.",Virginia Tech,0400,,,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Energy,Investment & Finance,,,"green building,building certifications",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Erin Hopkins,Assistant Professor of Property Management and Real Estate,Virginia Tech,0400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conservatives who conserve: How to talk about sustainability outside of politics,"Climate change and environmentalism have both become seemingly inseparable from political ideology. We should attempt, if possible, to keep sustainability from falling into the same partisan divide. While combating climate change and environmental protection have been argued by some to be 'anti-business', the broader view of sustainability includes economic facets that may allow for some common ground with political conservatives. In a recent survey of undergraduate students we sought to learn more about those considered themselves socially and economically conservative, yet demonstrated high levels of sustainability attitudes. We explored a variety of factors including: beliefs of individual responsibility, civic engagement, empathy, connectedness to place, and spirituality to uncover mechanisms other than political identity that motivated sustainability attitudes and behavior. We present the results of this study and discuss future opportunities for research in this area.",Michigan State University,0439,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,politics,10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Adam Zwickle,Assistant Professor,Michigan State University,0439,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Zwickle_2193.pptx,,,
Using the SDGs to progress sustainability,"The Sustainable Development Goals are the talk of the decade. Every nation state on the planet has signed up to achieve them - but what does this mean for tertiary education institutions? Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, has been doing some significant work to answer this question. From mapping high level public goals, to seeing how learning and teaching, research, and facilities goals and objectives at a micro level align with the SDGs, we have unpacked the 17 Goals and determined what we do with them. This presentation will discuss the mapping processes, the outcomes, and the way in which all this has been used to leverage conversation and action. Not a completely good news story, there will be an honest overview of the successes and challenges in framing the conversation around the SDGs, especially in a climate where the government has been noticeably silent and money matters most.",Macquarie University,0526,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),planning",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Leanne Denby,Director of Sustainability,Macquarie University,0526,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Denby_2028.pptx,,,
Sustainability skills - what are they? And how do we know students have them...,"Sustainability in the curriculum. Everyone is talking about it and wondering how you do it! Especially when you are a professional staff member entering into the world of faculty. Three years ago we set out on a path to embed sustainability skills and knowledge into all programs delivered at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. What a journey. This workshop will start with sharing some of our journey: the how and what, as well as the up's and down's, and key takeaways we've learned along the way. A real tell all, with nothing hidden, you will learn the methodology, the outcomes to date, the key to success, the challenges and hurdles - and even how to jump them. But that's only the start.... Most of the workshop will focus on unpacking sustainability skills and how we KNOW that students have them. A true facilitated session, you will be prompted to explore these topics in small groups and unearth THE key skills we should be aiming for all our students to have before leaving our institutions. You just might unlock the key to making change happen at your institution!

Opening New Markets for Local Food Through the Food Hub Model,"Black Hills Food Hub, a business incubated at BHSU and run by Cobblestone Science (a locally- and women-owned small business), coordinates the needs of cafeterias in the region with local food producers by serving as one point of contact for cafeteria managers to access produce from multiple local farms. The planning process involved BHSU sustainability staff and student interns talking with local producers, the BHSU campus cafeteria, and local cafeteria managers from the hospital, schools, and retirement homes. The consolidated information showed a clear pattern of a distribution gap between producers and cafeterias due to several concrete barriers. Through a locally conducted survey in 2015, it was discovered that only one Spearfish cafeteria purchases local food and it did so only once per year. It became clear that getting food into cafeterias would benefit the greatest number of people and provide a substantial economic boost to local producers, growing our agricultural community. The loud voice from area farmers is that the region needs more producers. The farmers we spoke with know that they are stronger in numbers. We took this into account in the food hub concept. One farmer may not have enough consistent produce for a large-scale cafeteria's weekly needs. However, collectively it can be done. As new producers come to the area, more markets will be opened and the Food Hub can access more cafeterias. Cafeteria managers taught us the fast-paced, low-margin structure of their work. With a passion for the culinary arts, most cafeteria chefs would love to use high quality and local ingredients. However, the price, time, and coordination required to work with many local farmers makes this unrealistic. The food hub tackles these issues by creating a system as close to a large food distribution company as possible with one contact ordering and delivering. The Black Hills Food Hub has agreements with three large area cafeterias: Regional Health Hospital, Carver's Cafe at Xanterra Parks & Resorts at Mt. Rushmore National Memorial, and the Black Hills Surgical Hospital. The cafeterias serve over 6,000 meals per day. The amount of food the cafeterias are willing to purchase will create a demand that allows full participation from all willing area producers. The project's first year economic impact was over $17,000 from sales of a full ton of produce.",Black Hills State University,0603,,,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Food & Dining,,,,"community partnerships,local foods",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Katie Greer,"Assistant Director, Facilities Services",Black Hills State University,0603,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Greer_2431.pdf,,,

Dismantling the Economic Walls Within: Why Solidarity is Necessary for Living Wage Policies in Higher Education,"Will the different insecurities on American campuses in 2017 pull people apart in narrow self-interest, or bring us together in common cause? While some forms of insecurity are external, others are internal, constructed by our institutions and maintained by indifference and ignorance despite our educational mission. At a time of potential powerlessness, institutions can and have made progress against structural economic insecurity of their own making - by implementing living wage polices and practices. This session consists of two parts. First, I provide an updated report on the extent to which colleges and universities have adopted living wage policies in the United States. Only a handful of institutions have a living wage policy, and only a subset of those schools have created a thorough and robust policy. Although larger number of institutions may engage in living wage practices, but have not adopted a formal policy due to additional financial costs and political risks. It is well past the time to afford all workers the basic dignity of a living wage. Second, I will help participants explore the readiness of their institution and its leaders for a living wage policies. Solidarity - combined with purposeful and effective action - is required take to make a living wage policy reality. Participants will discuss identifying allies, obtain successful strategies to organize for change, and exchange ideas to advance social sustainability on their own campuses.",Saint Joseph's University,0674,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Campus Engagement,,,,living wage,10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Ken Weidner,Assistant Professor of Management,Saint Joseph's University,0674,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1130_Weidner_2544.pdf,,,
"Influences of Student Sustainability Literacy in a University Setting, A Dissertation Study","This presentation will review the findings from a dissertation on sustainability literacy. The purpose of this study was to investigate how educational sources influence student knowledge, skills, and experiences regarding their sustainability literacy. Based on the purpose of this study, a mixed methods explanatory approach was used to reveal the degree university students were sustainability literate, how educational sources influenced student's sustainability literacy, and why students acted on their sustainability knowledge. Sustainability literacy and influences were assessed using an assessment tool, the Sulitest, followed by an interview process to reveal student influences of their sustainability literacy and why they acted on their sustainability knowledge. Influences were found to be formed from three education sources; curriculum, co-curriculum, and hidden curriculum. However, it is not just about the knowledge students gained in order to develop a high level of sustainability literacy, but about the skills and experiences they gained in the process. In this process, action has played an important step in the progression. As a result of these data found, conceptual frameworks are proposed to better understand how students are influenced and why they acted on their sustainability literacy. By investigating how educational sources influence students, universities may be able to create a world of professional which make sustainable literate decisions.",Saint Louis University,0704,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,sustainability literacy,10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Brandon Verhoff,,Saint Louis University,0704,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using Ecofeminism to Create a New Land Ethic,"Building upon Aldo Leopold's concept of a 'land ethic'-a philosophy that urges care and reverence for nature, the presenter will demonstrate ways in which we can use ecofeminist ideas and theory to (re)create a new and more sustainable land ethic. Our current and dominant social construct promotes a destructive relationship with nature, encouraging exploitation of the land and its resources and in turn, women. Women are exceedingly valuable in the recreation of our land ethic and play an imperative role in the future of sustainability; ecofeminism is a sustainable bridge between humans and nature. In addressing the ways in which patriarchal values have undermined the environment and women, the presenter will demonstrate to attendees how adopting and fostering an ecofeminist perspective can heal a broken land ethic, bring women together through means of empowerment and undermine oppressive social constructs.",Colorado Mountain College,0775,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Research,,,,"feminism,ecofeminism",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Mia Piccolotti,,Colorado Mountain College,0775,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Refugee Resettlement in Northern Colorado: A Social Sustainability Story,"The topic of refugee resettlement in the United States (U.S.) is met with varying reactions from Americans. Generally mainstream media portrays two sides of American opinion, the far right, referring to those who are against the acceptance of refugees and argue for the closing of American borders, and the far left, those who approve the acceptance of refugees. However, beyond those in opposition are many Americans who are undecided about the United States' role in refugee replacement. This presentation will detail a community-based educational project that seeks to inform those who are undecided on refugee resettlement in the U.S. and provide them with factual information and real-life stories that show and tell the refugee experience. Through collaborative support from local entities, a team of action-minded community members are working to develop mini-video documentaries that highlight the lives of refugees living in Northern Colorado, specifically in the city of Greeley. Greeley is a city with a population over 100,000 ('U.S. Censes Bureau', 2015) and is home to numerous refugees. As is to be expected, the merging of cultures is a complex process that can create tension and fear in a community, especially in a post-9/11 America. Unlike Denver and Colorado Springs, two Colorado cities initially set up by the government to be refugee cities, Greeley is home to refugees because refugees made the decision to relocate to Greeley. This is a best-case scenario/positive story.",Colorado State University,0828,,,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,,,,refugees,10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Renee Harmon,Instructor,Colorado State University,0828,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Harmon_2799.pptx,,,

A Campus Move Out Sale: The Journey From Inception to Year Six.,"Six years ago CSU's Housing and Surplus Departments decided to partner and pilot an additional step into the move out process, a sale with proceeds benefiting the Eco Leaders Student Organization. Having worked with non-profits in the past, we didn't know what to expect in terms of donation volume, quality, or how big the sale would be, but we sure found out. Jumping into year one not knowing what to expect, we were unprepared on what metrics should be tracked and ended up missing out on a lot of great data to help establish our base line and we were a bit overwhelmed by the amount of donations we received. We also had no idea what to expect from a large public sale, and were again overwhelmed when thousands of people came out to support the cause. The next few years were all about tracking data and streamlining processes. Now we have fine-tuned all facets of the operation from pickup locations, collections, sorting, pricing, advertising, set-up, and the best part, the sale. I will discuss our successes over the years and identify and demonstrate ways in which we have overcome barriers and shortcomings. These include increasing landfill diversion metrics, campus collaborations, and public engagement via adding the sale to our process. I will encourage members of the audience to critique our program and give insight into their own programs to help all of us advance together.",Colorado State University,0828,,,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,move-in & move-out,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Jake Drenth,,Colorado State University,0828,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Drenth_2071.pdf,,,
Developing Curriculum Around the Triple Bottom Line,"This presentation is to assist faculty in developing, or revising curriculum to fit within the framework of the Triple Bottom Line in regards to addressing topics of sustainability in their courses. We will begin the presentation by examining the Triple Bottom Line and agreeing on a definition. Then, the presentation will show how instructors can use various teaching methods, such as case-based instruction, service-learning, active-learning, etc. to teach sustainability. We will then go through one example of using a service-learning project to teach sustainability, integrating the Triple Bottom Line into the assignment activity. Audience members will be encouraged to think of research questions for the working example - the research questions should be formulated with the Triple Bottom Line in mind, thus, pushing students to think 'outside of the box' and consider environmental, economic, and social issues for a specific project/problem. I will also provide tips on how to integrate these ideas into an online course.",Colorado State University,0828,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,"triple bottom line,service learning,courses",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Renee Harmon,Instructor,Colorado State University,0828,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Harmon_2805.pptx,,,
Applying LEAN Concepts to Data Capture for Greenhouse Gas Reporting,"The Berea College Office of Sustainability submits yearly reports on greenhouse gas emissions based on travel done by faculty, staff, and students on behalf of the college. The types of transportation and miles traveled are tracked by the Accounting Department through the submission of Travel Miles Expense Forms, and then reported to the Office of Sustainability yearly. This information is converted to greenhouse gas emissions through a greenhouse gas calculator. With the help of the Continuous Improvement team, the Office of Sustainability worked with Accounting to make the process of tracking transportation more stream-lined and less time consuming. The end result was an application of LEAN principles that dramatically cut the amount of time members of Accounting had to spend recording data from each Travel Expense Form before it was made available to the Office of Sustainability for reporting. The LEAN principles of Visual Management, Standardization of Work, the Elimination of Over-processing, and the Reduction of Batch Size were utilized for a total yearly time savings of 64 hours and a soft money savings of $1,355. The use of these principles was a pertinent practice in waste reduction in the social component of sustainability, as workers in both the Accounting Department and the Office of Sustainability now have to apply less time to the monotonous task of data processing, and can spend more time on reporting relevant data to encourage behavioral change.",Berea College,0855,,,,,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Transportation,,,,ghg reporting,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Annette Dangerfield,Americorps VISTA,Berea College,0855,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Dangerfield_2058.pptx,1500_Dangerfield_2058.pdf,,

Mining STARS Data: Results & Lessons Learned From Quantitative Research Exploring Variation in Food/Beverage Purchasing Scores,"AASHE's STARS program offers great opportunities for monitoring campus sustainability progress and exchanging new ideas. In addition, the STARS database can support quantitative research in campus sustainability whose results aid practitioners seeking to expand progress or better understand constraints in a particular dimension of sustainability. For example, what explains variation in local and sustainable food purchasing advances, and how can understanding that variation support further progress? The proposed presentation will share the results of a quantitative study that uses multiple regression analysis to identify organizational and contextual characteristics associated with local and sustainable food and beverage purchasing scores (reported as credit OP-7 in STARS version 2.1). A preliminary study using STARS 1.2 and 2.0 data completed in December 2016 found statistically significant differences in food scores associated with geographical region and dining services operations. This presentation will discuss the results of an expanded analysis that incorporates STARS 2.1 data and that explores several alternative explanations for regional differences (including food crop diversity and food hub density).

A Fresh Start: From Soil-Grown Greenhouse to Hydroponics,"The study of the sciences occupy a prime place in Dominican University's curriculum. In the late 1930s, Dominican sister, Hilaire Ryan, OP built a greenhouse to provide botany students with hands on learning experiences. Seventy years later, several students installed a hydroponic system in the greenhouse but they could not keep it functioning. Therefore, I decided to restore and enhance the greenhouse viability by using the pre-existing hydroponic system, and introduced two new types of hydroponic systems: Bato Bucket system and NFT system. Why grow hydroponically? Research shows that growing hydroponically is an efficient and more reliable method of cultivation over soil gardening. Hydroponic system is an inexpensive gardening option that allows plants to grow 50% faster than using soil. The growing medium circulates the nutrients around the plant's roots, recycles the nutrient solution, and significantly reduces the amount of fertilizer needed. This system eliminates the use of chemicals and pesticides; it provides fresh produce that is naturally sweet and ripe. The transformation of the greenhouse into a hydroponic one, allows a diversity of plants to grow year-round. Students acquire a greater understanding of the origin of food and the processes necessary to grow and harvest produce by using hydroponic systems. I hope this innovative way of growing plants inspires others to participate in the sustainable food and gardening movement in our community.",Dominican University,1235,,,,,,,,,,,,,Grounds,Curriculum,,Biological Sciences (includes Ecology),,"greenhouses,hydroponics",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Kalelys Calero GonzÃ¡lez,,Dominican University,1235,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_CaleroGonzlez_3022.pdf,,,
"The Power of One: How a Physics Professor Saved Italy from Big Oil Through Education, Activism and Community Outreach","Trained as a physicist, Dr. Maria D'Orsogna is a hands-on activist fighting to protect the Italian countryside and seas from Big Oil. Maria first learned of proposed oil activities in her home region of Abruzzo, Italy. Oil companies planned to drill onshore and at sea, uprooting century-old wineries to build wells, refineries and pipelines, effectively turning scenic Abruzzo into an oil district. Although based in California - 6,000 miles away - Maria took it upon herself to raise awareness and educate the public at large. She blended her scientific training, her experience as a professor, and her strong desire for social justice into an environmental movement that rapidly spread across the country. She traveled from town to town in Italy, educating citizens about environmental and health effects, debating Big Oil, exposing political corruption, putting pressure on decision makers to act for the common good. In California she used social networks and blogging to coordinate letter writings, to keep raising awareness and spur action. Thanks to public uproar, spearheaded by Maria's unwavering efforts, Abruzzo banned oil drilling and for the first time ever, the Italian parliament imposed a no-drill zone of 12 miles encompassing all of Italy's 5,000 mile coastline. Overall she stopped at least 40 oil leases, earning the nickname 'Erin Brockovich of Italy'. Maria's story is a testament of how, by engaging with the community, scientists and educators can truly make a difference.","California State University, Northridge",1248,,,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Energy,,,,"activism,oil",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Maria D'Orsogna,,"California State University, Northridge",1248,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tweeting @Sustainability: The #447challenge as an Active Teaching Tool,"Growing up, we are 'challenged' to be sustainable: turn off lights, stop cold water when brushing teeth, and unplug idle chargers. Reality proves that, while well-conceived, the environmental benefit of these tasks is small. The #447challenge asks students in my Sustainability course (CIE 447) to be global examples of sustainability. Weekly Twitter challenges (e.g., #nomeatweek, #wasteLESSweek, and #emissionLESS) show students what is required to have actual impact. Some challenges are difficult, others are easy - that is the point! Participants (including enrolled students, faculty, and alumni) Tweet photos or messages describing their participation, for the class, campus, city, and global sustainability community to see. The project relies on student-teacher and student-student comfort, trust, and interaction - students are pushed towards thinking that if a classmate, or their engineering professor, can do it, they can too. We learn sustainability by living it. The project brings Twitter into (and out of!) the classroom, fostering student camaraderie and a deeper sustainability awareness. At its core, the #447challenge offers a unique way to teach sustainability to interested students, but the potential for far-reaching educational innovation should not be ignored. This AASHE session will describe the motivation, objectives, structure, and execution of the #447challenge. Assessment data summarizing student participation and educational impact will also be described.",University at Buffalo,1306,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,"social media,communications,marketing,courses",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,John Atkinson,Assistant Professor,University at Buffalo,1306,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Engineering Sustainable Community Relationships,"What can engineering students offer sustainability? What will they gain from sustainability? Providing engineering students sustainability experience is a priceless investment. By learning to take a triple bottom line approach to team-based projects, students may expand their skills and marketability and develop valuable professional connections. As sustainability establishes itself as a core operating principle in business and government, the need for interdisciplinary skills has become necessary for the successful implementation of many projects. This session will share information from the recent article 'Engineering a Sustainable Internship,' published in the Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, and results from the third summer of the Bowman Creek Educational Ecosystem project in South Bend, IN. Focused on environmental, social, and economic restoration in a low-income neighborhood, students from eight area colleges and high schools address the needs of all watershed residents. While understanding sustainability principles and practices is key to sustainability work, holistic business practices, data analytics, a 'triple bottom line' approach, life-cycle and supply chain management, energy systems, and communication skills are equally important to successful sustainability work.

Raising Energy Efficiency on an Urban Campus,"As an Energy Engineering student at IUPUI, I have always idealized these initiatives to make our campus more energy-efficient. I have made a plan on how to change infrastructure and raise awareness of campus energy usage. Considering we are a large medical campus we supply power not only to the campus but the four hospitals that exist as well. With being in the heart of Indianapolis there are so many different opportunities in which we can pull power and make an improved integrated system. With my poster presentation I will discuss my overall plan for awareness and improvement of campus energy usage. For the awareness portion I will discuss the Energy Competition I started at IUPUI, and how I went about educating the campus. IUPUI recently hit the return in investment for the solar panels that were installed on top of the business building. This made for the perfect time to start the conversation of getting more renewable technology on campus. To back up this conversation I planned out a microgrid system to slowly start integrating to the campus infrastructure. I will highlight the multiple steps I made to go about achieving this efficiency and the many resources I pulled in order to do so. I want to emphasize the fact that if you have the knowledge and know how anybody can make change. I will lay out a timeline of my college career and the steps I have taken to make my voice heard.",Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,1353,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,,,,"energy efficiency,urban focus",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Ashlee Paul,President of Student Sustainability Council,Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,1353,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SFU's Zero Waste Initiative,"In January 2014, SFU launched its Zero Waste Initiative, with the aim of diverting 70% of waste from landfill, while doubling the amount recycled or composted. This goal was adopted in the SFU Sustainability Strategic Plan (2013-16) and had strong administrative support. The Zero Waste Initiative has employed infrastructure improvements, cross-departmental governance, a comprehensive communication strategy, and demand-side management (waste production) to achieve this diversion goal in just 18 months. As a result of the implementation of the Initiative, the waste management system across the entire university was streamlined and standardized, increasing waste diversion to 70% from an estimated 25% in 2012, achieving financial and greenhouse gas emission savings, as well as increased operational efficiencies and enhanced sustainability education. The Initiative goes beyond waste 'management' and takes an in-depth look at SFU's waste footprint, finding innovative ways to incorporate circular economy principles into everyday functions in order to minimize this. Some examples are: Packaging standards for food vendors and caterers to eliminate non-recyclable/compostable packaging and move towards more sustainable options; A lifecycle assessment tool for Procurement to use in purchasing decisions to consider the impact of the item/service's full lifecycle; Sustainability criteria included in all public procurements.",Simon Fraser University,1367,,,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,zero waste,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Rachel Telling,"Program Manager, Sustainability Office",Simon Fraser University,1367,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Telling_2899.pdf,,,

Interactive Workshop: Simple Choices in Sustainable Purchasing? Beware the Pitfalls,"What's the simple answer for selecting a sustainable product?' Many purchasers ask this when seeking environmentally-responsible choices. Many of these simple answers may seem to be the correct ones at face value, but often provide only a partial solution, and sometimes can be misleading. As it turns out, the task of identifying sustainable products and services is a complex process, involving a variety of competing factors and impacts on health and environment. Products have to perform well, or else no one will buy them, and over their life cycle they can affect human health and the environment in many ways. Simple answers like 'biobased,' 'recycled content,' 'carbon neutral,' or 'BPA-free' can often be simplistic and may leave you with choices that don't meet your needs and end up being less than sustainable. We will survey some of the simple answers given for sustainable purchasing and outline some of the common pitfalls they might cause, with concrete examples of choices where there isn't necessarily a simple answer. A framework will be provided, helping identify the considerations purchasers and product designers need to address when determining the appropriate type of product. Participants in this interactive workshop will have the opportunity to create purchasing criteria, and then evaluate them based on the framework and additional information delivered during the presentation.",Green Seal,1388,,,,,,,,,,,,,Purchasing,Coordination & Planning,,,,"ecolabels,third party certifications",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Daniel Pedersen,VP Science & Standards,Green Seal,1388,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1130_Pedersen_2863.pdf,,,
What Sets Environmental Leadership? Depends on Your Approach: a case study of spray polyurethane foam insulation,"Explore how 2 highly respected sustainability leaders, the Healthy Building Network and Green Seal, could disagree so dramatically about the inclusion of spray polyurethane foam (SPF) in an environmental leadership standard. Perspectives from NGOs, manufacturers and purchasers on what constitutes environmental leadership will be explored. Green Seal recently developed an environmental leadership standard for insulation materials, including SPF. 50 organizations - led by the Healthy Building Network - opposed the inclusion of SPF as a green insulation material. How could two highly respected sustainability leaders disagree so dramatically? Both organizations conducted science-based analyses, agreed on the potential hazards associated with SPF and the need for protective measures when SPF is used as an insulation material. However, their distinct goals for sustainability led to different decisions regarding environmental leadership, and which protective measures would be sufficient to protect the health of installers and occupants. This discussion will showcase perspectives from these NGOs, manufacturers, and purchasers on their approach to environmental leadership, and how it led them to reach these conflicting decisions. Descriptions of the goals of each organization will be followed by an analysis of the hazards posed by SPF, and describe agreements and disagreements.

Transforming a Former Industrial Site into a Sustainable Solution and Creating Opportunities for Students,"Over the past fourteen years, SUNY-ESF has cultivated a successful public-private partnership with Honeywell International to address a pressing environmental issue in the local community. The project involves remediation of a former industrial site near ESF's main campus in Syracuse, NY. Salty organic waste materials were deposited on this site for 100 years, creating a threat to local ecosystems. Willow bioenergy crops have been planted on the site and perform the same function as a traditional landfill cap, effectively containing the waste at a lower cost, while providing other environmental benefits such as carbon sequestration and wildlife habitat. The goal is to utilize the willow biomass grown on site in ESF's combined heat and power (CHP) system, and ash from the CHP could be returned to the site as a soil nutrient amendment, creating a closed-loop cycle. Faculty and staff across several departments have collaborated on the project, and dozens of students have been directly and intentionally involved through paid research assistantships, course and capstone projects, graduate theses, etc. Student involvement in studying, maintaining and enhancing the system has been integral to the project's success. Overall, the public-private partnership and high level of student engagement is providing numerous benefits and opportunities, and has transformed a former industrial site into a sustainable and productive solution to an environmental challenge in the local community.",State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry,1404,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Public Engagement,,,,"remediation,community partnerships",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Justin Heavey,Research and Sustainability Staff,State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry,1404,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Presidential Power: Examining the Language of Executive Campus Commitments,"Over the course of the past decade, hundreds of college and university presidents have committed to an array of sustainability goals through platforms like Second Nature's Climate Commitment, the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, and Rating System (STARS), the Talloires Declaration, and many more. Many of those commitments require approval from a president, chancellor, or other campus executive, and some of those commitments require a statement of purpose on behalf of the institution's leader. This session will provide an in-depth analysis the content of executive letters submitted by STARS signatories, examining patterns and identifying correlation between an executive's language and her or his institution's performance. The presenters will share the results of a content analysis of hundreds of executive letters penned by the leaders of institutions participating in STARS and made publicly available. The research will look at the length of these letters, specific words and phrases used, definitions of sustainability offered, specific initiatives or achievements called out, and other noteworthy content. The presenters will also make some correlations between the nature of language used and the performance outcomes (such as the STARS rating) achieved by institutions. Though it wouldn't make sense to create a template letter or speech, the research seeks to provide a set of recommendations and best practices for executive commitments based on connections revealed.",U.S. Green Building Council,1493,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,"STARS,climate commitments,executives",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Josh Lasky,,U.S. Green Building Council,1493,Emilie Rex,Sustainability/Resilience Consultant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RE think. RE invent. Re use Necessary behaviors for Accessories - A circular approach,"In the times of hand production, the concept of discarded or unwanted items was almost non-existent. It took time and patience to produce things. Goods were manufactured from pure raw materials and involved little chemical processing. Tracing back the roots of mass production to the industrial revolution, the development of factory models and optimizing industrial methods to enable fast paced and low cost production came into practice to replace the inefficiency of cottage industry. As the world increasingly becomes conscious towards the environment, innovative business models are helping to counter the damage of the fast fashion system. When designers rethink how things are made, new possibilities for innovation emerge. Designing products, keeping in mind the end of life or another life, can mark a shift in the product-consumer relationship. This closed loop concept of a 'circular economy' is emerging as a viable and promising solution to the current linear business model. This study explores the possibilities of a more mindful approach to systems of production and consumption in order to engage with a circular economy. Drawing from various interdisciplinary design practices, this paper outlines a series of creative experiments that consider the generative and renewable approaches as part of redefining how fashion design engages with components and raw materials of the industry.",Virginia Commonwealth University,1546,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Public Engagement,,Design,,"circular economy,fashion design",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Wajiha Pervez,,Virginia Commonwealth University,1546,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Comparative Study of the Efficacy of Intervention Strategies on Student Electricity use in Campus Residence Halls,"In this session, we discuss research that employs a quasi-experimental design to reduce student electricity use in residence halls. We examine electricity use by first-year students in four matched residence halls and the relative efficacy of three different interventions designed to encourage energy conservation, specifically electricity conservation. Students in all residence halls receiving interventions demonstrated significantly lower electricity consumption compared to the control residence hall. Across two years with different student populations, results were consistent: the residence hall receiving only the communications and programming, but not the dashboard, had the lowest electricity use. The residence hall with only the dashboard also demonstrated a significant, but smaller decline in electricity use. The results indicate combined interventions are less effective for reducing students' electricity use. We also explore the potential cost-savings of these different strategies.",Radford University,1559,,,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Energy,,,,"residence halls,students,energy reduction",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Allison Wisecup,,Radford University,1559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Intercultural Understanding, Garden Benefits, and Sustainability Discourse at the Shawneetown Community Garden","For years, anthropological and environmental researchers have studied the contributions of community gardens to education, health, community development, and sustainability; however, community gardens within institutional contexts such as universities are not as well understood (Andreatta 2015, Armstrong 2000, Ferris et al 2001, Glover 2003, Irvine et al 1999, Kingsley et al 2009, Twiss et al 2003). This presentation explores the results of an ethnographic study of the Shawneetown Community Garden at the University of Kentucky, which investigated the social, cultural, and economic benefits of the garden. This community garden is particularly interesting given that it serves the residents of the Graduate and International Family Housing. Consequently, participating gardeners are multi-generational and culturally diverse. The primary research goal was to explore how the garden fostered community development and intercultural understanding. In addition, the study gathered gardeners' thoughts about sustainability and suggestions for improving the garden. Information was collected through participant observation at garden-related events and open-ended, unstructured interviews with Shawneetown gardeners, who were selected through convenience sampling. Research results shed light on the role that community gardens can play in fostering intercultural understanding alongside community development, especially within institutional contexts.",University of Kentucky,1600,,,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Public Engagement,,,,"gardens,community gardens",10/15/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Elise McConnell,,University of Kentucky,1600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cradle to Gate Life Cycle Energy Analysis,"Due to recent hysteria over climate change, investment in reusable, sustainable energy sources was promoted with the intention to replace the current energy giants: coal, oil, and natural gas. Algae biofuels showed particular promise compared to other alternatives due to algae's high proliferation rate, carbon capture rate, and relative resistance to environmental conditions. A PBR is an enclosed vessel which the algae cells are able to grow and reproduce. It utilizes sunlight as an energy source for the algae and has gas/ nutrients injected into each tube. The Center for Applied Energy Research (CAER) designed a cyclic, vertical PBR with energy efficiency prioritized. A lifecycle analysis evaluates the environmental impact of a specific operation or product. In this case, the total energy required to construct and operate a PBR was assessed. All energy consumption was evaluated for the required raw materials extraction, manufacturing each part of the PBR and one year of operation.",University of Kentucky,1600,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,,,,,"life cycle assessment,algae technology,biofuels",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Ryan Lark,Undergraduate Researcher,University of Kentucky,1600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Motivating Students to Achieve 20% Electricity and Hot Water Savings in Campus Apartments,"Through Clarkson University's Smart Housing Project, we've shown 20% savings in daily electricity and hot water use for students receiving utility use interventions compared to students not receiving the interventions. The electricity savings were observed for students who receive an enriched motivational intervention PLUS real-time feedback through a dashboard that illustrates utility consumption use. For water, results revealed a strong and significant effect of only the enriched motivational intervention. The substantial savings resulted from an experiment conducted in four campus apartment buildings with 360 students over three-years. In the enriched motivational intervention, participants attended a workshop designed to target their individual reasons for wanting to save energy and resources, including a goal-setting exercise. In the feedback manipulation, half of the apartments were equipped with interactive real-time energy and utility use dashboards displayed on the living room wall. The feedback and assessment of differences among groups was enabled through the implementation of a sensor array to monitor electricity and water use at each outlet and fixture in 77 apartments.

New England's Largest Campus Solar Project,"In early 2017, UMass Amherst completed the installation of 5.5 MW of solar power over two parking lots and five rooftops making it the largest solar project on a college campus in New England. All of the electricity generated from this project is used on the campus. Four years ago this project was just a pipe dream of an idea existing only on paper in a solar energy plan. The plan used the Campus Master Plan as a tool for identifying major swaths of campus land suitable for solar development. Over the next four years the planets aligned that made this groundbreaking project become a reality: federal and state incentives were set in place, the UMass System hired an energy consultant who had hired a Director of Sustainability & Renewables, an electrical sub-station was built which enabled more distributed generation, and the campus administration was issued a recommendation to improve it's renewable energy portfolio by a sustainability external review team. Ezra and Zac will tell the story of how their teamwork made this project happen through the lens of both a campus sustainability professional and a consultant. They will provide the major lessons learned and share any unique and creative strategies used from the procurement through the construction process.

GreenTopics: How we Tackled Reaching Environmental Skeptics,"Engaging students with an environmental interest is easy, but the question remains 'How can we reach the environmental skeptics?' How can we inform the students who will never step foot in an environmental science course? One student group sought to address this issue through a student presenter program called GreenTopics. GreenTopics are specific environmental topics presented by WKU GreenToppers members to address commonly misunderstood environmental concepts. Topics like carbon policy, responsible consumerism, and oceanic pollution are all important to the future of society, but they are seldom discussed outside of environmental science courses. This presentation will provide a thorough explanation for how the GreenTopics program was developed including; how it is structured, how we advertised and the general feedback. By providing professors with the tool of a sustainability student presenter, we are able to step into a course that a student is interested in and demonstrate how that course also relates to the environment.

Western Kentucky University Student-Designed Campus Sustainability Survey 2017,"For our 2017 AASHE conference presentation, we would like to share the story of our student-designed sustainability survey created in Fall 2016/ Spring 2017. It all began as a project in our GEOG 344 Environmental Ethics course. Our Sustainability Coordinator took the idea to our professor and together, they decided to incorporate the assignment into our curriculum. Students were given a list of themes that helped separated the such an arduous task into more manageable sections.Each class member contributed five questions to their chosen theme and brought them into class. The following classes were spent discussing our proposed questions in depth. We analyzed phrasing, question structure, and ultimately the survey strategies we could use to get us the information we desired regarding campus sustainability. In the spring semester, a committee remained to continue progress on the survey along with the help of our SGA President and our Student Sustainability Ambassador.As environmental science students, we had to pause and look through the eyes of an individual who may not have an environmental background, an understanding of sustainability vocabulary, or even an interest in protecting the planet. We believe that other college students and their universities could greatly benefit from creating their own sustainability survey in or outside of the classroom.

Data-Based Assessment of Wind Power Feasibility,"This presentation will describe the process by which a feasibility study for wind power to supplement Ball State University's energy budget has been developed. Ball State has a commitment to sustainable energy, most prominently seen through its recent implementation of the largest geothermal energy system at a public institution. But the University still draws all of its electrical needs through the utility grid. Since 2012, a long-term preliminary study on the wind power potential near Ball State has been conducted. Initial results, based on two years of site-specific wind speed measurements and actual power curve performance estimates of five commercial wind turbines, indicate that four out of the five turbines selected for the study could be expected to achieve payoff of combined lifetime costs well within the turbines' estimated lifetimes. Expected savings on the cost of electrical energy range from $2 million to $4 million for a 25-year lifetime. Another 2 years of wind speed data will be analyzed and presented in conjunction with these results at the conference. Student involvement in the form of an immersive-learning course and independent study research has formed an integral part of this project. Presentations of the positive case for wind power have been published and will be shared with the University sustainability advisory group. Feedback on administrative response towards implementing wind power will be discussed.",Ball State University,1826,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Coordination & Planning,,,,"wind,feasibility studies",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Eric Hedin,Associate Professor of Physics & Astronomy,Ball State University,1826,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Hedin_2203.pptx,,,
"DON'T PUNT ON RECYCLING! What your recycling program can mean to your school's curriculum, eco-identity, & bottom-line!","This presentation offers a macro-view lens of Sustainability Programs as one of the only truly new tools traditional fixed-sight Higher Education Administrators have to answer the dot-edu on-line degree program challenge. Two decades of legislatively mandated recycling programs in Colleges and Universities will be reviewed for best practices illustrating cutting-edge examples of how sustainability programs have integrated campus operations and academic curriculums, providing renewed vibrancy for traditional campus-based education. Recycling is the 'gateway drug' for sustainability programs and can offer a positive eco-identity for an Institution as well as compliment the bottom-line of your school in an age of diminishing operating funds. Recent studies have shown that college students are using sustainability as one of the top criteria for choosing an Institution of Higher Education. By combining sustainability-based campus operations with educational programs, traditional campus-based higher education administrators can answer on-line degree program claims that their format is more relevant and 'hand-on' versus traditional fixed-sight educational format and venues.

FreshU: A Sustainable Model for Reducing Food Insecurity on College Campuses,"The University of Central Florida (UCF) is located in the heart of a food desert; a region defined by the USDA as 'a low-income community that lacks ready access to healthy food.' According to the most recent assessment conducted by the American College Health Association (2017), 79.7% of the University of Central Florida's student body do not meet the daily fruit and vegetable intake recommendations. UCF has addressed this issue through an interdepartmental partnership called FreshU. This program provides students with hands on experiences working with sustainable forms of community supported agriculture, while producing food for at risk populations throughout the University. Food is grown primarily in the UCF Arboretum's Organic Community Garden as well as via vertical aeroponic towers installed throughout campus, and maintained by UCF's Wellness and Health Promotional Services (WHPS). Produce is then distributed through the Knights Helping Knights on-campus food pantry, and directly to students through on-campus give away events. WHPS provides recipe cards, nutritional information, and cooking demonstrations to ensure students know how to identify and utilize unfamiliar fruits and vegetables. This interdepartmental partnership has allowed UCF to provide students with thousands of pounds of free, fresh, local produce annually while simultaneously embedding both hands-on educational and volunteer opportunities and campus sustainability initiatives into student's lives.",University of Central Florida,2006,,,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,"gardens,food pantries,food security",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Jennifer Elliott,"Assistant Director, Arboretum and Natural Resources Programs",University of Central Florida,2006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gardening As Engagement: Utilizing Local Alternative Break Trips to foster student growth in food systems and urban gardening,"Alternative Break programs have long been considered an effective transformative and experiential learning opportunity for students. One challenge of these trips, however, is the lack of application when students return from these travel experiences. One way to combat this challenge is to provide an alternative break that focuses specifically on issues of concern in the local community. For the past two years, The University of Central Oklahoma Volunteer and Service Learning Center and the Office of Sustainability have offered Local Alternative Breaks that focus on local food systems and urban gardening. This has provided a rich experience in which students and staff participants learn about local food systems and how to shift our current food system towards sustainability by focusing on organic gardening, nutrition, and gardening as a community building initiative. Students and staff engage with on and off campus partners to learn about these ideas in a workshop format before getting their hands dirty in the gardens, and applying the knowledge they have learned. This session will focus on how UCO has constructed the curriculum and fostered the community partnerships that make this program an engaging and fulfilling way for students to spend their Fall and Spring Breaks. Then, participants will get a chance to develop their own possible local break trips focused on sustainability principles, and network and troubleshoot with fellow practitioners.",University of Central Oklahoma,2052,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,"gardens,spring break,food systems,service learning",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Eric Hemphill,Asst Dir.

Transforming University Curriculum Policies for a Global Knowledge Society: A focus on a Chilean Context.,"University curriculum changes are moving to a centre stage in the higher education reform agendas of many countries, as they strive to strengthen their positioning in a competitive global knowledge society. Consequently, development of quality university curricula to attract the 'best and brightest' students has become a significant feature. These international trends are underway in Chilean universities, although specific curriculum moves are shaped within the unique contexts of localized settings. A number of the nation's universities are prominent in their engagement with curriculum policies which resonate strongly with those in Europe and the United States, which pose challenges for Chilean higher education. Rising to these challenges requires a strong evidence base to support curriculum policy development in Chile universities. This project focuses on curriculum policy transformations at 3 of the 10 best Chilean research-intensive universities. At each one the emphasis at the undergraduate level is on developing their 'whole curriculum' on general education principles of a liberal-humanist nature, while specialist and professional university education is being provided at postgraduate courses. These transformations, when viewed historically, are radical and unprecedented within Chile, while at the same time carrying extensive costs and risks for the universities themselves, as well as for national positioning within the international scene.",University of Western Australia,2099,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Curriculum,,,,"Chile,international",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Victoria Valdebenito,PhD student,University of Western Australia,2099,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Valdebenito_2911.pdf,,,
Green-to-Green Project: Economic Empowerment through Sustainable Agriculture,"In addressing the need for healthy, fresh produce in our community, we established a partnership of neighborhood gardens and local partners to serve as a hub for local food production and access. Jointly recognizing the barriers to food security in our community, this network identified a strategy for safeguarding the environment, sharing knowledge and providing economic sustainability to an urban food system. The green-to-green project proposes a holistic approach to food production by shortening the supply chain, increasing local food production capacity while providing easy, affordable access of locally grown produce to market. Community members participating in the green-to-green network are able to sell all excess produce cultivated in their neighborhood gardens at a farmers' market sponsored by Johnson C.

There will also be time for the groups to share out or ask questions of the full room, if more information might be gleaned that way. Based on previous experiences at AASHE, meetings focused on EcoReps programs are always full, and usually very focused on program type. Program facilitators are always looking for ways to improve engagement, retention, and curriculum for their specific programs, which vary greatly from institution to institution. The goal of this meeting is to provide the opportunity for crowd-sourced problem solving and information gathering for each participant based on their individual needs.

A Classroom of 'Cultural Creatives'?: A Values-Based Approach to Teaching About Sustainable Societies,"In their book The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People are Changing the World authors Paul H. Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson present their research on the on-going values shift within the modern world-a values shift that is more reflective of what is needed to move towards sustainability, despite the direction of the current presidential administration. In using this book for my Sustainable Societies course I have been able to invite students to critically engage with not only their own values but those of their families and of the larger society. Furthermore, in using this text I have been able to make direct connections to many of the current presidential administration's policies and to openly critique them through the 'cultural creative' lens. This is a challenging yet vital time to be teaching about sustainability and doing so in ways that allows us to engage in political discourse while respecting diversity of views is highly improtant. Therefore, in this presentation I will introduce the cultural creatives argument and offer examples of the engaged ways I have been teaching it and how else it might be used. Additionally, the audience will be invited to review their own values and to what extent and in what ways they put their values into practice their personal and professional lives. Finally, we will collectively evaluate how such practices do and don't reflect the potential for achieving sustainability.",University of Connecticut,2131,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,"values,courses",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Phoebe Godfrey,Associate Professor in Residence of Sociology,University of Connecticut,2131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Integrating Sustainability Across Disciplines: A Step-wise Process for (Re)designing a Syllabus,"Integrating sustainability' into a course means adapting both content and pedagogy to create a learning experience that is more interdisciplinary, experiential, and focused on authentic problem-solving. How can instructors juggle all of these demands without abandoning disciplinary expertise or designing a syllabus from scratch? In this hands-on, fast-paced workshop, participants will 1) develop a transdisciplinary framing of sustainability relevant to their discipline, and 2) (re)design an existing or planned syllabus using a guided, hands-on process. Through this process, participants will: - Apply transdisciplinary concepts to reorient their content. - Develop experiential instructional approaches - Create a course sequence that leads students through engagement, deep inquiry, decision-making, and positive action. - Apply a 'backwards design' process to align outcomes, instruction and assessment. Participants will have opportunities to work with peers within and across disciplines. Depending on the scale of their redesign, participants will walk away with a course makeover or a firm blueprint for completing one. Participants will receive an instructional design booklet with support tools and frameworks. Note to reviewers: This workshop has been presented at two past AASHE conferences.

Transforming a Campus for Zero Waste by Focusing on People,"Change is difficult; changing people's habits and shifting organizational priorities is an even bigger challenge. Yet, we are all faced with a global imperative to take action to protect our common home. Aquinas College will share its journey of transformation toward authentic sustainability using the college's robust zero waste initiative as an example. Aquinas has been working aggressively on zero waste since 2012, and its 68% diversion rate is top 10 nationally (based on 2016 RecycleMania standings). This success has been accomplished by focusing on the 'people' piece of sustainability. Driving behavior change, building social capital, and establishing new cultural norms are critical yet the most difficult components of a sustainability strategy. But how does one engage the entire campus and establish a cultural norm for sustainability, and zero waste specifically? Conference attendees will learn about Aquinas College's experiences with establishing new standards to achieve zero waste success, such as personalizing collection systems, engaging champions, educating for zero waste, motivating behavior change, and creating the practice of sustainability at the grassroots level.

"Learnings in Advancing Sustainability, Measuring Progress, and Keeping Campus Clean with Smart Waste & Recycling Solutions","Now more than ever, colleges and universities are placing emphasis on creating a comprehensive campus-wide approach to increase commitment to sustainability, efficiency, and the environment. This commitment is embodied by a variety of initiatives, mandates, and plans across the country, and is grounded by the motivated student body, faculty, and staff on each campus. Central to sustainability and environmental impact is waste management. How can you showcase commitment to sustainability via recycling programs, incentives, and education outside the classroom? Are you faced with recycling mandates associated with state funding? Have campus goals been set in regards to waste reduction, the introduction of compost streams, and an overall reduced GhG footprint? How can these programs be implemented at scale, with ease, and in a measurable manner? What are the waste related goals and initiatives on your campus? How can your campus leverage technology available to use to achieve these sustainability goals? In this session, we will discuss stories and lessons learned from colleges and universities who have implemented smarter solutions to manage their waste and recycling on campus.

Multiple Ways of Knowing in Sustainability Education: Stretching the Boundaries of Transformative Sustainability Learning,"This session focuses on how teaching for multiple ways of knowing can contribute to sustainability education by highlighting work done at the University of Saskatchewan which is encapsulated within two papers. In the first paper we identify six portals of understanding, or threshold concepts, which can be used as curricular guideposts to disrupt the socially constituted separation, and hierarchy, between humans and the more-than-human. The threshold concepts identiï¬ed in this study provide focal points for a curriculum which (1) acknowledges non-human agency; and (2) recognizes that the capacity to work with multiple ways of knowing is required to effectively engage in the process of sustainability knowledge creation. The second paper chronicles students' experiences of transformative sustainability learning through a pedagogical orientation which focuses on expanding the ways of knowing that someone respects, understands, and/or engages with. With a particular emphasis on decolonizing relations between humans and the more-than-human, this enables students to articulate and critically engage with the epistemologies of their academic fields, gain new(old) perspectives on relations with the more-than-human, and interact with Indigenous knowledges in more effective and ethical ways. Students in this study experienced powerful learning outcomes in the following areas: reconceptualization of relationships, acknowledgement and deconstruction of power, and worldview bridging.",Goucher College,2315,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,,,"transformative learning,indigenous culture",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Matthew Harmin,Sustainability Coordinator,Goucher College,2315,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Harmin_2578.pptx,,,
Community Partnerships for Environmental Justice,"The Tishman Environment and Design Center at The New School is committed to environmental justice and community-academic partnerships grounded in the Jemez Principles for Democratic Organizing. Using this framework, the Center embarked on three projects, each reflecting the needs of the communities and partners involved. (1) Community-based organization in New York City (El Puente) that we co-designed and produced research about air quality and green spaces adjacent to roadways; (2) Group of environmental justice scholars that prepared research on the environmental justice implications of the EPA's Climate Power Plan; (3) Global alliance of activist networks (GAIA) with research support for campaigns related to zero waste and plastics. These three multi-scalar collaborations produced learning outcomes for students, faculty and partner participants. The efforts revealed opportunities and challenges of academic community partnerships grounded in the Jemez principles. Some of the key lessons for establishing authentic partnerships include (1) Training faculty and students on environmental justice and Jemez principles to familiarize partners about expectations and commitments required before taking on collaborative projects; (2) Taking care to be transparent about the terms of collaboration using tools like Memorandums of Understanding or Principles of Collaboration; (3) Building trusting relationships based on an ethic of care rather than purely transactional partnerships.",The New School,2334,,,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Curriculum,Research,,,"environmental justice,community partnerships",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Molly Johnson,University Sustainability Associate,The New School,2334,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Johnson_2287.pdf,,,
Light Up With LED,"Light Up With LED was a semester long, student-led project at the Ohio State University to educate our off-campus student population about energy efficient behaviors. Sponsored by a Coca-cola Sustainability Grant, the program sought to engage students in these practices while they were experiencing independent living for the first time. The goal was to educate participants on how they could make choices that reduce consumption of natural resources and save money in hopes that they would carry on with these behaviors for the rest of their lives. Participants registered to turn in old, incandescent and fluorescent bulbs and received new LED bulbs in exchange. They could trade in up to five bulbs, and they were also given a reusable bag with information on additional energy efficient behaviors they could practice as well as the proper disposal methods for certain types of light bulbs. In addition, the program reduced the amount of hazardous waste entering landfills.The incandescent and fluorescent light bulbs collected were taken to a local hazardous waste center to ensure that mercury and other materials did not end up in the landfill. A post-program survey was taken to determine what participants learned about energy efficiency and if they felt sustainability programs like Light Up With LED were valuable.

Deep Energy Retrofits: Warren Hall at Cornell University,"Learn how a pre-war, 130,000-square-foot classroom building at Cornell University was retrofitted to achieve LEED Platinum performance. The historic masonry building was fully renovated into a new, modern home for the University's undergraduate business program. Cornell's challenge to the design team was to comprehensively upgrade the steam-heated, non-air conditioned building to current standards of comfort and accommodation without increasing net energy use. Hear how the performance of the envelope was improved while preserving the historic exterior, how modern mechanical systems and technologies were incorporated, and how Cornell's robust campus sustainability approach enabled the project to become a model for adaptive retrofit of other pre-war buildings on campus and nationwide.

Advancing Innovation through Sustainability Research and Scholarship,"During this monumental time in history, it is essential to be educated, connect with good people, find hope, and discover new ways to make a difference. To do so, the Greater Portland Sustainability Education Network (GPSEN), with the support of Portland Community College, has developed innovative and replicable models for engagement. This session will highlight three ways to advance research and scholarship: hosting a Sustainability Symposium to highlight cutting-edge work in our region; developing curriculum with ecopsychologists to train students and community members on how to have hope and resilience and face climate change; and establishing a regional think tank where scholars and fellows across institutions can explore and share their work.

Gaining Hope and Resilience During Troubling Times,"Learning about environmental, social, and economic sustainability issues can be daunting and overwhelming, especially when considering how to create solutions to pressing problems. In these times of accelerating change and challenges where we are bombarded with negative news that numbs and overwhelms the spirit, how can we build hope and resilience? How do we build stronger internal and external supports for sustainability personally and for our communities? How do we hold hope for our planet? Using the motto 'Educate ~ Empower ~ Engage,' this half-day training provides practical strategies and tools for cultivating hope and resilience through an ecopsychology perspective. With three sections of focus: Personal, Community and Planetary, this training will consist of a combination of short lecture and group activities giving participants resources that they will be able to use in their own lives and communities.

Offsetting University Travel Through Energy Efficiency on Campus,"At Portland State University (PSU), business travel is responsible for approximately 6,009 metric tons of carbon emissions, or 1,265 cars on the road, each year. Acknowledging that travel is mission critical and is not likely to decrease, PSU's Campus Sustainability Office created an internal travel offset program designed to mitigate this notoriously difficult source of emissions for universities. While many organizations purchase third-party carbon offsets to address travel emissions, PSU developed an innovative, homegrown solution that reduces energy consumption, improves campus facilities, and further solidifies our commitment to climate action. That being said, there have been multiple challenges and we are constantly striving to improve this program. This session aims to ignite discussion and critical thinking regarding the environmental impacts of university or college sponsored travel. It will provide an overview of our travel offset program including logistics, rationale, and the pros and cons of our approach.",Portland State University,2515,,,,,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Transportation,,,,"air travel,carbon offsets,emissions reduction",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Jennifer McNamara,Campus Sustainability Manager,Portland State University,2515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_McNamara_2430.pptx,,,
"University of Scranton Community Garden, Planning, Partnerships, Students, and Surprises","Attendees will enjoy a conversation on the University of Scranton's journey to plan and establish a Community Garden. One of the Sustainability Office's goals is to raise awareness to sustainable practices and as a campus we already have programs for recycling, car share, bike share, energy saving, water saving, and more. However for our campus to be a true leader in sustainability, we felt the miracle, the magic of growing food needed to be part of what we teach. The garden has been an opportunity for students, faculty, staff, neighbors, and the local community to teach and learn by doing and by example. We have involved local businesses, a hospital, Penn State Outreach Extension, Lackawanna County Sustainability Office, Leahy Center Clinic, University of Success program, and ARAMark in this project. Six hundred pounds of food was produced by the garden and donated to an on campus medical clinic for uninsured people where the food was made available to the patients. The surprises of the project will be presented. Some of those surprises include growing six hundred pounds of food, the innocent excitement of our student workers, the joy, the challenges and more. As one of our students stated before we started the garden, 'to be truly sustainable the university has to grow things'.

A Multidisciplinary Approach to Sustainability Education for Public Two-Year Colleges,"Even as an increasing number of employers seek personnel skilled in renewable energy technologies and sustainable design, companies overwhelmingly hire individuals for 'green jobs' who possess that knowledge within the context of a broader discipline, not as part of a specialized degree. Given this trend the EMERGE Program for Sustainability & Renewable Energy at Seminole State College of Florida has launched a unique multidisciplinary curriculum to enrich and enhance students' existing degrees, and to provide opportunities for students to pursue sustainability content via a flexible 'nested' certificate. Designed to satisfy future technicians and non-technicians alike, the Sustainability Certificate offers course options suitable for students pursuing university transfer (A.A.) as well as those on pre-professional (A.S.) tracks at the College-such as Engineering Technology, Drafting & Design, Construction, and Supply Chain Management. Program electives range from sustainable business to U.S. environmental policy and include also more technical, industry-linked options such as solar contracting, green building, and energy analysis. The certificate culminates in a final capstone customized to each student's degree and area of expertise. Whether in the lecture hall or the workshop, the EMERGE Program aims to produce better-informed global citizens who are prepared to seek out innovative and responsible solutions in whatever they're next life steps may be.",Seminole State College of Florida,2556,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,"community colleges,green jobs",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,James Miller,"Coordinator, Project Admin & Research",Seminole State College of Florida,2556,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Miller_2956.pdf,,,
Lorax 2.0: Twenty Questions for Standing in Solidarity with Living Systems in Sustainability Research in Higher Education,"Ethical alignment and systems thinking are at the core of sustainability considerations. How can colleges apply sustainability approaches to the process of academic research itself? Researching sustainability similarly invites ethical considerations of larger systems, including living systems. This session details how researchers at one small liberal arts college are rethinking sustainability research and researching sustainability. This case study describes breakaway approaches for including the more than human. The Prescott College Institutional Review Board (IRB) engages in a systems approach to the ethical review of research. We facilitate our IRB process starting with our '20 Questions' worksheet, a tool intended to help researchers become aware of their orientation with their topics and to question underlying assumptions. This means that researchers must deliberately contemplate how the way they see the world impacts the research they conduct and consider such questions as-What kind of mutual relationships may emerge for the researcher? What awareness of the social-ecological systems of the topic might be affected by the research process? These questions experientially engage researchers in understanding the ethical implications of their work in turn supporting the tenets of sustainability. We will discuss this process and facilitate a discussion for integrating living systems into IRB and research designs.",Prescott College,2588,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Curriculum,,,,"systems thinking,ethics",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Mary Jackson,,Prescott College,2588,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Growing Healthy Kids: The Intersection of Health, Justice, and Sustainability","The Pollinator Education Action and Sustainability (PEAS) program, is an extension of Trinity University's Biology department. The mission of PEAS is to establish native pollinator sanctuaries in urban areas throughout San Antonio. Initially funded by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, PEAS continues to grow with the support of volunteers and key partners throughout the community. PEAS partnered with Gardopia Gardens in 2017 to establish pollinator sanctuaries at K-12 schools in lower-income areas. Gardopia Gardens is a 501(c)3 nonprofit founded in 2015 by an Incarnate Word graduate. The mission of Gardopia Gardens to teach communities about the importance of practicing wellness in their daily lives through gardening, in turn, creating a healthier, more educated, and environmentally sustainable society. Gardopia's Garden-Based Learning (GBL) Program offers evidence-based horticultural education in K-12. GBL has been shown to significantly increase student consumption of fruits and vegetables. Together, PEAS and Gardopia are implementing evidence-based GBL programs in 10 partner schools throughout 2017. Our GBL program works to reduce rates of childhood obesity by empowering students to grow and prepare fresh foods.

Sustainable Food and Dining at Trinity University: Barriers and Success,"Beginning with food and dining is the most effective way for students to engage in sustainability movements because students engage with the dining hall as many as three times a day. Dr. Richard Reed, Aramark representative, Charles Robles, and I began completing the STARS initiative, along with implementation of several other programs in the dining hall including a garden and local food sold in the campus convenience store. Communication and marketing were the most important strategies for food sustainability initiatives in the dining hall. The intersection of employee, professor, and student working on the project allowed for the most communication among the administration, higher Aramark officials, and the student body. We each brought a different perspective and expertise to the project, which simplified the process. Before this year, no one at Trinity was able to dedicate time to the project, and the project consistently fell through. Additionally, many of the regulations set by Trinity's food provider created setbacks for progress; however, beginning the process allowed us to pinpoint the key areas for change to develop an effective strategy for changing our approaches to food. Getting the students involved through marketing in the campus store and in the cafeteria allowed for more momentum, and a clear interest in better food.

Sustainability & International Service,"Cafe Femenino: This coffee empowers women In late May of 2017, 10 Utah State University (USU) students and 2 faculty leaders traveled to Peru to assist women coffee producers in addressing issues of food insecurity in their community. The USU Center for Community Engagement partnered with Caffe Ibis and the Cafe Femenino Foundation to adopt a greenhouse project proposed by women in the village of Corral de Piedra. Corral de Piedra is a small, rural village in the Andes of Northern Peru. Because coffee is the cash crop, most families in the area do not grow their own food. Hunger and malnutrition typically occur during the rainy season or early months of the harvest when annual income from coffee has run out and food prices are high. In an effort to combat seasonal hunger in the coffeelands, women coffee producers submitted a grant proposal to Cafe Femenino Foundation for a community greenhouse that would protect vegetable crops from pests and excessive rain. USU students and staff adopted this grant proposal, raised funds and worked alongside community leaders to construct a community greenhouse that will serve as a model for coffee farming communities throughout the region. Since June, more than eight additional greenhouse gardens have been requested by CafÃ© Femenino communities.

Building Bridges to Conservative Students to Build Support for Climate Action and Enrich Campus Conversations,"As the conference Call for Proposals noted, the broader political and cultural environment in the U.S. today makes it more difficult than ever to prevent sustainability efforts on campuses from becoming identified as a liberal project. Students who identify as conservatives tend to be disengaged from, skeptical of, or hostile to initiatives focused on environmental sustainability. Climate change is, of course, a particularly divisive issue. In the wake of the 2016 Presidential election, a professor and two students at Concordia College began a project aimed at understanding the perspectives of conservative students on campus and at bringing conservatives into campus conversations about how to take action on climate change. One of the student leaders is the president of the conservative organization on campus and believes that conservatives need to take on a leadership role in addressing the problem of human-generated climate change. Starting in January 2017, we are convening ten focus groups of conservative students, hosting two public events focused on conservative approaches to reducing carbon emissions, and developing a bipartisan/cross-ideological student group focused on climate action. At this session, we will present the results of this project, detailing how our findings build on previous research in this area and assessing how successful we were in building conservative support for climate action at Concordia.",Concordia College,2930,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,"politics,communications",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Kenneth Foster,"Chair, President's Sustainability Council",Concordia College,2930,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Foster_2530.pptx,,,
The Climate Commitment: Getting the President to Move From 'no' to 'yes' -- and Then Maximizing the Impact of the Signature,"At many colleges and universities, the president is highly reluctant to sign the Climate Commitment (of Second Nature), with its pledge to achieve carbon neutrality and increase community resilience. At other institutions, the president may sign, but once the moment passes attention fades and progress stalls. Five years ago, students at Concordia College petitioned their president to sign the previous version of the Climate Commitment (AUCPCC), and faculty expressed support as well. The answer was no. In January 2017, this same president announced that he would sign the commitment in April and devoted the intervening months to rallying the campus and preparing for the hard work of developing the action plan. This presentation will describe how those leading sustainability efforts at the college worked, over a several-year period, to make this happen, offering lessons and tips to others seeking to persuade their institution to sign onto the Climate Commitment. Beyond detailing strategic and tactical moves that proved to be important, the presentation will offer more holistic observations about the process of organizational change that the shift from 'no' to 'yes' represents. Once Concordia's president decided he would sign, he and sustainability leaders designed a three-month process leading up to the actual signing, that would maximize the impact of the signing and get the campus off to the best possible start. This will be described in the second part of the presentation.",Concordia College,2930,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Air & Climate,Campus Engagement,,,"climate commitments,executives",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Kenneth Foster,"Chair, President's Sustainability Council",Concordia College,2930,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Institutional challenges in CO2 footprint goals, inventorying, and implementing cost effective measures to meet the goals.","Presentation addresses challenges in setting actionable goals for sustainability in educational institutions. Students have great passion but no experience; academics want hands-on and research opportunity; facility managers are pragmatic and risk averse with responsibility to ensure trouble free service, while leadership wants student success and brand recognition while balancing funding demands. Establishing actionable goals is further complicated since inventorying of CO2 footprint is not a perfect science. Urban institutions have big CO2 footprint: staff, students and faculty commute; academic travel by students and faculty, business travel by staff, and transportation by institutional vehicles. Facility managers know the CO2 footprint of the facility systems, but have no idea about travel related CO2. Both of these are unknown to students and academics. Also, not all CO2 items are amenable to reduction strategies and are not in manager's control. One has to rely on strategies in his/her control - typically facility systems, but must over-compensate for CO2 producers for which there is no control. I found that facility systems accounted for only 33% - 55% of total CO2, creating an exceptional challenge for reaching a net zero emissions goal! Presentation shows advanced, out-of-the-box strategies, with 4-5 yr payback that appeal to the finance staff.

Energy Monitoring as a Tool for Community Engagement,"This poster will detail the process and results of electricity monitoring for behavior change in the Luther College Sustainability House, a residence focused on discovering what it means to live environmentally, fiscally and socially responsibly as a community. At the beginning of the 2016-17 academic year, the college installed hardware to enable the monitoring of household electricity consumption and electricity production of the house's 4kW solar array. Two of the ten house residents were tasked with monitoring and communicating the information to their housemates. Throughout the year these two 'energy educators' learned how to effectively communicate energy data and developed strategies for using that information to drive community decision-making and behavior change. Many lessons were learned throughout the year regarding the way information was presented, considered and discussed. While exploring aspects of accountability, the poster will focus on positive forms of dialogue about energy, along with less-effective strategies. The poster will also address how these lessons will be applied to a larger energy monitoring and engagement platform that is being developed for Baker Village, an all-electric housing facility for senior students at Luther College.",Luther College,3098,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Energy,,,,"behavior change,themed housing,energy management,energy reduction",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Nathan Campbell,,Luther College,3098,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Campbell_2395.pdf,,,
"Infrastructure, Audits, and Education: A Three-Pronged Approach to Waste Reduction","This poster will demonstrate how Luther College is working to achieve its zero waste goals by investing in infrastructure, conducting waste audits and creatively educating the campus community. Under the assumption the campus community will properly dispose of waste if given the opportunity and appropriate infrastructure, the college has made significant investments in waste infrastructure over the past few years. Improvements include installing roll-off bins outside of each residence hall, centralizing and streamlining collection points within buildings and installing a pulper in the cafeteria dishroom. The addition of four-stream bins and the simultaneous removal of all classroom trash and single stream recycling bins provides comprehensive waste disposal options at every corner, while decreasing custodial labor hours required for pick-up. Waste audit data collected pre and post infrastructure changes demonstrates that this approach is working to effectively reduce tons of solid waste sent to the landfill while diverting a greater volume of compost and recyclables from the dumpster. Waste audits continue to provide valuable information about common waste disposal misunderstandings and provide a basis for educational efforts aimed at reducing contamination rates. Monthly waste challenges and social media initiatives work to engage students while working towards zero waste goals.",Luther College,3098,,,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,"zero waste,waste audits",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Megan Oliver,Student,Luther College,3098,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Silence: a Luxury or Commodity,"Today's luxury items are increasingly demanded with one caveat, that they are silent. Silent appliances, cars, vacations all come with a high price. While the upper middle class reach for their pocketbooks to pay for such luxury, the people who truly need silence within their community are struggling. Noise pulsates through the inner city neighborhoods of our Metropolitan areas like the life-blood of a body. This noise creates stress, emotional challenges and relational imbalance; and becomes the consistent obstacle in the struggle to find peace.

Unifying Campus Audiences in Co-Curricular Sustainability Programming to Create Action-Oriented Projects,"Dickinson College has innovatively reformed its student and employee peer-to-peer sustainability outreach and education programs to create co-curricular learning experiences aimed at building solidarity with campus stakeholders. This session will explore three examples of combined-audience education where students, faculty, and staff were unified for Sustain IT workshops, Exploring Our Place field trips, and Eco-Rep campaigns. Working together, participants learned, discussed current practices and ideas for improvement, and then identified action items that could create positive change towards a more sustainable campus or community. Redefining the goals and objectives of these programs, has helped us meaningfully engage a larger and more diverse audience that reaches beyond 'the choir'. Additionally, by combining audiences, we have created more direct connections to academic coursework, advanced institutional change by developing non-traditional sustainability partnerships, and fostered coalition-building through living laboratory experiences on campus and in the community. We will discuss best practices and participants will have a chance to look for ways to strategically combine their peer-to-peer education efforts to create measurable action-oriented outcomes with a purpose.",Dickinson College,3185,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,"peer-to-peer,eco-reps,living labs",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Lindsey Lyons,Assistant Director,Dickinson College,3185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Lyons_2425.pptx,,,
Integrating Sustainability With Energy and Facilities Management at the Alamo Colleges District,"Alamo Colleges District is a network of five community colleges serving the diverse population of San Antonio, TX and surrounding areas. With a commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050, this session will focus on Alamo Colleges' efforts to minimize the environmental impact of its daily operations by applying energy management and savings practices such as Continuous Commissioning®, participating in demand response programs, implementing 4-day work weeks during summers, and introducing thermal energy storage systems on three of its campuses. The colleges have also successfully installed a total of 600-kW capacity of solar panels that provide energy, educational experiences, and in some cases shading for parking. As a signatory of one of Second Nature's three Climate Leadership Commitments, Alamo Colleges developed a Climate Action Plan to pursue its sustainability goals. An Environmental Sustainability Policy and Procedure was adopted in 2012. As a result, the Alamo Colleges' Facilities department developed a Sustainable & Green Cleaning Housekeeping Policy, a Grounds and Irrigation Sustainability Policy, and an Integrated Pest Management Policy. This presentation will also emphasize the successful implementations of sustainable policies, completing water-savings and xeriscaping projects, and how Facilities is currently working on LEED certifications for its buildings to ensure the colleges' operations and maintenance are more sustainable.",Alamo Community College District,3423,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Coordination & Planning,,,Facilities Management,"energy management,solar",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,John Strybos,Associate Vice Chancellor of Facilities,Alamo Community College District,3423,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Strybos_2270.pdf,,,

Sustainable Food Policy Creation - University of Denver,"The University of Denver (DU) has been a Real Food Challenge Signatory since May 2015. As DU's food service provider, Denver Dining by Sodexo has performed extensive research within and outside their supply chain to aggressively increase their procurement of 'real' food to reach the 20% goal of 'real' food purchases by 2020. In collaboration with DU's Center for Sustainability throughout this research process, we have discovered that there are medium sized food operations utilizing sustainable practices into their business model. These operations are examples of how our large-scale industrialized food system can make incremental changes to becoming sustainable at a realistic pace. Many of these medium sized food operations do not qualify under the Real Food Challenge parameters, and although Denver Dining by Sodexo is still on track for reaching our 20% 'real' food purchasing goal by 2020, DU's Center for Sustainability collaborated with student groups and Sodexo to create a Sustainable Food Policy for the University of Denver that would recognize and qualify certain medium sized sustainable food operations. This process has provided students with multi-level research and critical thinking opportunities of how we can achieve a sustainable food system for the University of Denver, while they have simultaneously researched and audited for the Real Food Challenge Calculator.",Sodexo,3600,,,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Coordination & Planning,Research,,,"real food,policies",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Mandilyn Beck,Sustainability Coordinator,Sodexo,3600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Beck_2710.pdf,,,
Developing a Green Fund,"The Green Fund at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln (UNL) is a pool of money that is available to all students to do projects on campus that relate to creating a culture of sustainability at the university. With approximately 25,000 students attending UNL and a small fee collected by the Association of Students at the University of Nebraska (ASUN) student government, every semester there is massive potential to create a culture of sustainability at the university. The Green Fund increases the diversity of projects and allows more students and staff to be involved with sustainability movements on campus. The goal is to take ideas from students and turn them into a reality. Currently there is an annual budget of about $50,000 to fund projects, however, awarding these grants has not been as easy as expected. Many obstacles have been encountered since the first semester of acquiring funds. These issues include marketing the Green Fund to a large student and faculty body, converting ideas to feasible projects, the overall evaluation of projects, and a potential budget cut of the Green Fund.

Implementation of Pre-Consumer Composting in University Student Union: Obstacles and Lessons learned,"As an institution with over 25,000 students, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) produces an overwhelming amount of waste. UNL has successfully achieved a campus-wide diversion rate of nearly 50 percent, but this student-led initiative was developed with the intention of increasing the rate to 90 percent and achieving zero-waste status. The transformation to a zero waste campus can be a daunting task, but through the implementation of a comprehensive campaign, we have began to find success. Our goal has been made more achievable by focusing on three areas: identifying components of the university system that have potential to transition to more sustainable practices, establishing appropriate waste reduction and diversion infrastructure, and gaining student support to provide upward pressure on the administration to cultivate university-wide progress.

Building Sustainable Food Systems Programming and Community-University Partnerships: A Case Study of the UNC Student Farm,"Institutions of higher education with programs focused on sustainability are increasingly integrating curriculum and experiential learning opportunities related to agriculture and food systems. The Environmental and Sustainability Studies (ENST) program at the University of Northern Colorado (UNC) is one such example; the program has a newly established student farm and new courses on food systems and sustainable agriculture. This session presents a case study of the relatively rapid development of the UNC Student Farm program, including efforts to introduce new food and farm related curriculum, to integrate the student farm with disciplines across campus, and to promote community engaged learning opportunities. Since its inception the student farm has established partnerships with a local farmer, the school district, and an entrepreneur who is turning food waste from the UNC dining halls into compost. And yet, while our hope is to further integrate the farm into courses across campus, only ENST courses currently provide experiential learning opportunities on the farm. In presenting both early successes and challenges, this case study illustrates how sustainable food system programming and student farms in particular, can help break down disciplinary silos and promote community-university partnerships that can bridge gaps, such as those between industrial and sustainable agriculture.",University of Northern Colorado,3689,,,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,"farms,food systems,community partnerships,experiential learning,courses",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Kevin Cody,Faculty Instructor,University of Northern Colorado,3689,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Cody_2547.pptx,,,
"Build Environmental Equity, Sustainability, and Community Bridges PIEER internship: self-reflection and community engagement.","The University of Northern Iowa has a unique environmental equity internship which is training students on multiple levels to revision sustainability from an equity perspective. This program is designed to have a real impact on the community and on the student. This is accomplished through establishing an understanding on the part of the student about systems analysis of issues, inculcating practices that allow students to work through difficult equity and social justice implications and through developing an understating of environmental health disparities. This poster will place the educational program and experience within a theoretical framework using these grounding theories. This approach to experimental and transformative education in environmental equity/sustainability we are calling transformative, trans-theoretical equity education, T2E2.

Solar PV and Interactive Education,"Solar PV technology is decreasing in cost and increasing in popularity worldwide. However, there are still many individuals who do not understand this technology, even on college campuses. Education plays a very important role when it comes to the future of renewable energy. Interactive displays are a great way to engage a campus and its visitors in learning. An interactive display was created at North Central College by a physics undergraduate student to illustrate how solar PV technology works using a solar panel and colored LEDs. It was designed to illustrate the spectral response of solar PV panels. With the rising interest in solar PV, this shows possible future consumers the science behind their design. This session will provide the tools needed to create a similar design on campuses to display the renewable technology available. The original design will be demonstrated as a visual and interactive aid to prompt ideas for renewable education tools.",North Central College,3706,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Energy,,,,"solar,renewable energy,interactive",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Sarah Gaither,,North Central College,3706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Gaither_2183.pdf,,,
"An Unlikely Match: Confined Budgets, Sustainable Campuses, Facade Innovation","High performance design strategies are realized by a collaborative, interdisciplinary team working towards a shared vision. The design of the maintenance and operations building provides a diverse user group an active, high performance workplace that fully utilizes innovative passive design principles. The maintenance and operations building is a 28,000-square foot campus project located at the gateway of a community college. The building serves the grounds and maintenance service across a 252-acre campus. Programmatically, the design integrates traditionally segmented shop spaces, office spaces, and warehouse spaces into one facility. This spatial diversity presented a unique opportunity to reallocate the costs associated with mechanical infrastructure to the building facade. The project uses a unique passive design system to embrace its southern California climate, and a narrow building footprint provides year-round optimal temperatures throughout the building. Innovative design strategies, such as thermal chimneys and roof monitors, create increased natural ventilation, lower building energy consumption, and decrease mechanical infrastructure. These features provide an 85% reduction in cooling hours and a 30% heating load reduction on a typical winter day. The design challenges the typical maintenance and operations building typology by creating a positive, high-performance campus environment that centers on human purposed design.",BNIM Architects,3720,,,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Energy,,,,"building design,passive design,energy reduction",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Matthew Porreca,Principal,BNIM Architects,3720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arkansas Tech University Campus Master Plan: Embedding Resiliency in the Design Process,"For campuses looking to take a strategic long-term view of their future, strengthen stewardship of their facilities, and reinforce community integrity, resiliency is more than just a question of preparing for climate change. Perkins + Will partnered with Arkansas Tech University to create a 20-year campus master plan which embedded a highly collaborative series of resiliency workshops within its process. This presentation summarizes how a holistic approach to resiliency was embedded into the master planning process for, the unexpected challenges for the campus it raised (from social unrest to nuclear plant closure), and the exciting projects and opportunities it resulted in (from embracing storm water to programs in harvesting green energy). Using established resiliency thinking from the US Green Building Council and the Rockefeller Foundation, the process leaned heavily on the creativity, collaboration, and distributed leadership at Arkansas Tech to explore issues and opportunities specific to their location, mission, and culture. Ultimately, the process guided, challenged, and strengthened the incorporation of resilient design into the master plan while galvanizing support and growing understanding of potential shocks and stressors on campus from students to senior leadership.",Perkins+Will,3737,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,"master plans,planning",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Peter Baird,,Perkins+Will,3737,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on publicly available information from the programs' websites, it attempts to evaluate the quality of their curricula. Aside from a general qualitative analysis, the paper also develops a scoring system to assess the depth and breadth of the programs. Conceptually, sustainability cannot exist in a vacuum; hence, the paper also looks at the general sustainability efforts of the universities available on campus.

Familismo Teaching: Promoting Sustainable Development and Social Justice in a Hispanic Serving Institution,"Higher education (HE) has started taking responsibility in teaching, training, and researching for sustainability. Thus, sustainability and the scholarly environments have become the basis of academic practice since the initial conception of EfS captured by the UNESCO in 1992 (Cavas, et al. 2014). Research, however, reflects EfS is rarely practiced, and when it is, the teaching methods remain unchanged; suggesting no 'pedagogical innovation' (Christine et al 2013). Academic development of Hispanic college students appears to draw interest for many reasons, including high desertion rates. Despite becoming the largest ethnic group in four year colleges; in Texas for example, graduation rates are disproportionate. Hispanics hold a graduation rate of 29.7% compared to the 39.6% for white students (Murillo & Schall, 2016). For universities to contribute meaningfully to sustainable development of all students, the UNECE (2011) suggest a transformation in the core of HE, namely curriculum and pedagogy (Hurney et al., 2016). This presentation will inform how a First Year Writing instructor at a HSI has implemented an 'innovative pedagogy,' and allowed social justice by combining EfS and Familismo Teaching (FT), a culturally sensitive pedagogy, which serves as an intervention measure for at-risk students. Qualitative data reveals indices of success (motivation & retention) by combining EfS with sustainable environments in and outside of the classroom as those proposed in FT. Preliminary results reveal emergence of successful persistent scholars and motivated leader citizens. Participants will be informed about how they can also achieve 'innovative pedagogies' and will be invited to reflect and make changes to their teaching practices. Thus, allowing significant gains and learning opportunities for critical populations including at-risk Hispanic students and other minority groups attending HSIs or similar organizations.",University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,3868,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Diversity & Affordability,,,,"MSI institutions,social justice,HSI institutions",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Yemin Sanchez,"Writing & Language Studies, Lecturer II",University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,3868,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Sanchez_2295.pptx,,,
Salt Lake Excess: A Transportation-Based Food Recovery Model,"Restaurants and charities often desire to divert surplus food to communities in need, but logistical constraints prevent this. Salt Lake Excess, developed by a student group at the University of Utah, has developed a novel real-time food recovery system focused on eliminating this major obstacle in conventional food recovery. Using our partnering online food recovery tool, MEANS Database, businesses log their excess food into the Database. Charities registered with us are notified when their specified food needs are available so they may claim the food. Excess then mobilizes on-call volunteers to transport the food from donors to charities. Our database incentivizes businesses to donate by recording and distributing data for tax-deductible charitable contributions. We work in partnership with Salt Lake City Department of Sustainability, Salt Lake County Health Department and Utah State Agricultural Extension Program to expand our project's scope, food resources, and outreach to disadvantaged communities. Thus, our transportation-based model connects food-insecure communities to healthy food surpluses that would otherwise be landfill waste. The function of our ongoing research is to codify the model's operational logistics, volunteer organization, and best practices in a standardized manual; record food diversion and tax data; expand the program to each college and university in Utah, as well as nationally through MEANS partnerships.",University of Utah,3994,,,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Public Engagement,,,,"food recovery,food donation",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Shannon Jones,"Associate Instructor, Project Lead: Food, Movement, and U.",University of Utah,3994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Integrating Sustainability Learning Outcomes Into a University Curriculum - A Case Study of Institutional Dynamics,"The University of Vermont (UVM) adopted a learning-outcomes-based general education sustainability requirement in Fall 2015. The requirement is unique because sustainability is a non-traditional general education theme, and general education requirements are routinely course-based, not learning-outcomes based. The learning-outcomes based nature of the requirement allowed us to create a flexible requirement with three options: taking a sustainability-approved course, enrolling in a sustainability curricula, or engaging in an experiential endeavor whereby the learning outcomes can be met outside of the classroom. We will present how the requirement was successfully implemented through strategic consideration of three important institutional contexts: governance structure, academic culture, and the overall institutional environment. There were 3 stages: (1) pre-operational and sustainability learning outcomes development, (2) formal process and official adoption by UVM's Faculty Senate, and (3) implementation. As we discuss the institutional framework and the procedural steps taken, we will define key characteristics of success, including patience and genuine attention to process, deliberate and transparent action, willingness to collaborate, and an alliance of students, faculty, administrators, and staff. Our case study can assist other institutions to develop their own strategies for adopting university-wide sustainability requirements.",University of Vermont,3995,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,"learning outcomes,general education",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Laura Hill,Senior Lecturer,University of Vermont,3995,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Hill_2224.pdf,,,
George Washington University Fostering Federal Sustainability,"Sustainability is one of the nine core values of George Washington University (GW).

Towards a Broader Conceptualization of Education for Sustainability,"Formal teaching and learning devoted to sustainability is referred to as Education for Sustainability (EfS). EfS is the study of humans' relationship with the resources that support life on this planet. In its most traditional sense, the consensus from the literature is that EfS is a reoccurring set of instances on sustainability in the classroom, like a course that integrates sustainability subject matter throughout the semester. Typically, EfS is thought of as these dedicated courses on EfS. However, I suggest that we should broaden the definition of EfS to include all structured classroom instances that touch upon sustainability in order to explore where and how it is happening in its most primitive form. This classification of EfS is intentionally broad so that it can capture all higher education coursework that touches upon sustainability concepts, ranging from a class session, to a full unit, to an ongoing theme or topic throughout the semester, to a sustainability-related semester-long course.","Teachers College, Columbia University",4021,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,"Education for Sustainability,infusing sustainability",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Jessica Michel,,"Teachers College, Columbia University",4021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Exploring the Presence of the Economic and Social Dimensions of Sustainability Within Higher Education Classrooms,"Sustainability is commonly comprised of three main dimensions: environmental, economic, and social. The environmental dimension, sometimes referred to as the ecological dimension, concentrates on the reduction of negative human impact on the ecosystem. In addition, the economic dimension focuses on the impact that environmental problems have on the economy. For instance, environmental problems diminish the possibility for future generations to enjoy consumption, wealth, utility, or welfare comparable to those we enjoy in present day. Furthermore, the social dimension, sometimes referred to as the equity dimension, is positioned at the intersection of environmental and economic concerns. The social dimension is the relationship between human rights, environmental justice, and corporate power. To date, the majority of the focus of sustainability subject matter in higher education classrooms is around the environmental dimension. As such, this session explores the presence of economic and social subject matter on sustainability, and discusses ways to enhance students' learning about the broader conception of sustainability.","Teachers College, Columbia University",4021,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,"social dimensions,economic dimensions,general sustainability",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Jessica Michel,,"Teachers College, Columbia University",4021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Path Towards Reaching Nitrogen Footprint Reduction Goals at the University of Virginia,"A nitrogen (N) footprint is the amount of reactive nitrogen (Nr; all N compounds except N2) released to the environment as a result of an entities' resource use. At the University of Virginia (UVA), Allison Leach and James Galloway developed the first nitrogen footprint tool for an institution. After the development of this tool, UVA began an effort to involve other institutions in calculating N footprints under the formation of the Nitrogen Footprint Network (NFT). Today, the NFT includes 18 institutions from the US as well as 3 international institutions. In 2013, UVA became the first institution to set an N footprint reduction goal of 25% by the year 2025, relative to the baseline year of 2010. Reaching a 25% N footprint goal at a large, growing university is a challenge. UVA is projected to grow significantly in gross square footage and population by 2025. In 2016, UVA's Office for Sustainability launched a greenhouse gas action plan, which outlines strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at UVA. Members of the nitrogen working group calculated the impact that implementation of this plan will have on UVA's N footprint. The team determined that these actions make a significant impact towards the university reaching its N footprint reduction goal. If achieved, these greenhouse gas reduction plans along with other actions currently in place are estimated to also reduce the nitrogen footprint by over 10%. If other scenarios focusing more on food strategies were to be implemented, then UVA could achieve its 25% N footprint reduction goal. This poster will outline many strategies UVA plans to implement to reach this goal.",University of Virginia,4028,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Air & Climate,Food & Dining,,,"nitrogen,nitrogen footprint,climate action plans",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Elizabeth Milo,,University of Virginia,4028,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Milo_2925.pdf,,,
"Campus All-STARS: a model for streamlining reporting, improving performance, and creating synergies to advance sustainability","The University of Washington is a globally recognized leader in sustainability. That leadership is only possible through the dedication and work of our many and diverse campus partners ranging from operations to academic departments. UW Sustainability (UWS) connects all of these partners and coordinates data collection for reporting. To facilitate this effort, as well as create a space for other conversations to improve and expand the university's sustainability efforts, UWS created a special group to inform, support, and coordinate the efforts of our campus partners called 'UW All-STARS'. The establishment of the group produced surprising results. The All-STARS framework helped streamline and optimize reporting efforts, but it also created many new opportunities to improve performance and advance sustainability on the campus that may not have arisen without the opportunity for the campus partners to meet regularly in person.","University of Washington, Seattle",4030,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,"STARS,sustainability reporting,committees",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Sean Schmidt,Sustainability Specialist,"University of Washington, Seattle",4030,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Review of Sustainability Strategies of U.S. Universities and Federal Buildings,"Universities around the world share a common goal of making their campuses more sustainable and energy efficient. Significant investment has been made in the greening campus effort, yet the challenge remains in determining how to invest funds in providing the greatest impact. Measurable goals and strategies are needed in both the planning/design and operational phases. These goals should reflect the unique culture and specific requirements of individual campuses, which makes adopting a single green building design standard a challenge. The objective of this report is to provide an overview of green building strategies adopted by different universities and federal agencies across the United States. By reviewing successful planning guidelines and emerging practices, the University of Washington can improve its existing green building design guidelines. At a minimum, all 15 universities reviewed were committed to having their new buildings and major renovations meet the nationally accepted LEED rating system at different levels. Some universities developed their own rating system/certifications with more rigorous performance targets tailored to their specific needs. These tailored strategies are discussed in detail. This assessment also indicates that most of the largest federal government building owners adopt LEED in order to meet the latest Guiding Principles for Sustainable Federal Buildings published by the Federal Energy Management Program.","University of Washington, Seattle",4030,,,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Coordination & Planning,,,,"building design,planning,LEED",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Amy Kim,,"University of Washington, Seattle",4030,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Kim_2285.pptx,,,
A Working Model: The Synergy Between UW Sustainability and Student-led Campus Sustainability Fund,"Green fee funds are managed in different ways on college campuses. For this panel, we will be sharing the ways that University of Washington, Seattle Sustainability department and the Campus Sustainability Fund (CSF) collaborate to enhance one another's mission and synergistically advance sustainability initiatives on UW's campus. UW Sustainability's extensive connectedness to campus departments and central administration provide both latitude and longitude for CSF projects to incorporate advisement and participation from administration, faculty, staff, and students. The CSF serves as a platform to advance University goals around reducing carbon emissions, increasing operational efficiency, and diversifying involvement in sustainability initiatives by leveraging the ingenuity and enthusiasm of project teams. The resources that UW Sustainability provides the Campus Sustainability Fund are invaluable, and the resulting projects exemplify transdisciplinary collaboration that serve as creative and meaningful approaches to sustainability challenges.","University of Washington, Seattle",4030,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,Investment & Finance,,,green funds,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Kyle McDermott,Campus Sustainability Fund Coordinator,"University of Washington, Seattle",4030,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Readdressing Environmental Thinking in Residence Hall Design,"This presentation will examine the role of architectural design in promoting an ecological citizenship. By comparing traditional residence hall designs with contemporary residence halls as well as a LEED certified design, this case study looks at the ability of these various designs to promote ecological citizenship in future generations of university students. This study examines patterns of student everyday behavior and connects these patterns with design elements at multiple scales of daily life, from the design elements in a single residence hall room to the connection of the residence hall within the larger city fabric. Referencing Sverker C. Jagers' definition of an ecological citizen as well as multiple behavioral theories, this research connects ecological identity with ideas of community, space, and place. Base on survey, interview, and mapping data, this investigation will expose potential moments in residence hall life where sustainable learning can be promoted through specific spatial schemes.",University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,4059,,,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,,"residence halls,LEED,building design",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Sarah Keogh,,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,4059,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Keogh_2713.pdf,,,
Motivating and Quantifying the Impacts of Behavior Change,"In today's increasingly technological and personalized world, how do sustainability professionals provide opportunities to engage their audience in a way that is relevant to them? Stanford has taken the next step in meeting this need with its My Cardinal Green program. During a three-month pilot of the program, with a target participation of 500, the program yielded an average annual savings of $25,000, with more than 1000 unique actions performed to reduce the environmental impact of the university, in categories including energy, water, waste, transportation, purchasing, and engagement. My Cardinal Green provides personalized recommendations of actions that individuals can take to help them act more environmentally sustainable. Because each person has a unique lifestyle and role on campus, the program begins with a survey to generate suggested actions that are most relevant for them. Users receive points for each action that they successfully complete and, after earning a certain amount of points, can receive a reward for their efforts. In a followup survey, more than 90% of respondents indicated that completing the actions taught them something new, and that they would keep the actions up after completion of the program. Overall, more than 60% of follow up respondents indicated that they had reduced their environmental footprint as a result of the program. With a campus launch in Spring 2017, this session will focus on engagement program best practices and lessons learned.",Stanford University,4127,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Research,Wellbeing & Work,,,"behavior change,gamification,games,information technology",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Fahmida Ahmed,"Director, Sustainability and Business Services (former AASHE chair)",Stanford University,4127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045_Ahmed_2349.pdf,,,

Let's Talk Trash and Recycling: How to Build a Comprehensive View of Campus Waste Management and Diversion Efforts,"Developing a comprehensive waste management plan, policy, and data tracking system can be a daunting, yet rewarding task for an institution. These materials not only provide information on existing campus waste and recycling streams, responsible parties and duties, data collection and reporting, and operational guidance, but they also detail waste diversion goals and provide recommendations for achieving those goals. By developing a waste management plan, policy, and data tracking system, an institution builds a comprehensive view of campus waste management and diversion efforts and is able to track progress both at a granular and high level. This allows the campus sustainability community to break down the silos between departments, make connections, and build bridges to further progress toward the institution's waste diversion goals. But how do you get started? What is the path to develop these materials? In this session, we will chart Lehigh University's path to developing a comprehensive plan, policy, and data tracking system. Lehigh went from having no plan or policy and a very simple tracking system in 2016 to having a fully developed, comprehensive plan, policy, and data tracking system in 2017. Through efforts like this, institutions continue to enhance the culture of sustainability on their campus. Together we can reduce our campus' environmental footprint, be responsible stewards of our institution's resources, and contribute to our sustainability goals.",Lehigh University,4140,,,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Coordination & Planning,,,,"recycling,waste plans",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Katharine Targett,,Lehigh University,4140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Targett_2351.pdf,,,

"Defining Sustainability: An Innovative, Employee Online Training to Reach Beyond the Choir","Universities and organizations across the world are integrating sustainability into their services and operations and see sustainability literacy across their workforce as a key step in the integration process. Penn State and Pepsico, with a combined workforce of almost 300,000, are collaborating to create an online sustainability module targeted to administrative and managerial staff. Penn State is uniquely suited for this project due to its diverse faculty and staff with experience and expertise in training pedagogy, sustainability concepts, and online education - three key components of a successful online module. Pepsico is providing funding and vast expertise in workforce training, as well as a potential piloting space. The module will introduce staff to the resource depletion crisis and a decision-making framework based on concepts of systems thinking, temporal thinking, and ethical responsibility, three of the five sustainability competencies identified by a recent Penn State study. The module creation process taps into best practices for communicating this message, pulling from scholars in our Communications and Psychology Departments, and cutting edge research on workforce training and online instructional methods. In this session, we will discuss best practices in developing online employee sustainability training, audience customization, ideas on weaving this training into staff professional development programs, and techniques for evaluating impact.",Pennsylvania State University,4190,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,"training,professional development",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Lydia Vandenbergh,Associate Director of Employee Engagement and Education,Pennsylvania State University,4190,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Vandenbergh_2613.pdf,,,
Building Community through Intergroup Dialogue,"Intergroup dialogue (IGD) is a facilitated discussion between two or more identity groups that explores conflict and tension around issues of social justice, power, privilege, and bias. IGD is designed to develop a sustained conversation that can open pathways to deep communication and trust between individuals and groups. As a Sustainability Director actively participating in this process on a small, liberal arts campus, Amy will share her experiences and insights on how IGD can be used to improve social sustainability and community-building on our campuses.",Lewis & Clark College,4199,,,,,,,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,,,,"identity,social justice,intergroup dialogue",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Amy Dvorak,Sustainability Director,Lewis & Clark College,4199,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sustainable Development Anchored in a Dallas TX Community College,"The World Bank states that 'sustainable development recognizes that growth must be both inclusive and environmentally sound to reduce poverty and build shared prosperity for today's population and to continue to meet the needs of future generations. It must be efficient with resources and carefully planned to deliver immediate and long-term benefits for people, planet, and prosperity.' All community college campuses are imbedded in a local community. The question is: How can community colleges and or universities be an anchoring institutions that promote and educate about the importance of sustainable development? The questions then become: How can the students, faculty and employees of higher education promote and support ecotourism in their communities to leverage economic development? What methodologies and experiences exist on this topic? This session will share what has been done at the Sustainable Communities Institute of Cedar Valley College in Dallas, TX. The presentation will describe of the work that has been done through an alliance with the Greater Dallas Planning Council and the Best South West Partnership that includes a total of 12 cities of the DFW Metroplex.

Ecotourism as an Economic Development Driver,"All college and university campuses are imbedded in a local community. All communities have the potential to offer ecotourism opportunities to residents and visitors. Ecotourism is now defined as 'responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of the local people, and involves interpretation and education' (TIES, 2015). The questions then become: How can the students, faculty and employees of higher education promote and support ecotourism in their communities to leverage economic development? What methodologies and experiences exist on this topic? This session will share what has been done in the community colleges of Santa Fe, NM and Dallas, TX. The presentation will describe of the work with stakeholders to promote and train the community about the importance of sustainable development and how ecotourism can help conserve the environment and produce jobs and quality of life for the local community.

Sonified Sustainability: Building Deeper Green Coalitions,"A key to creating truly sustainable institutions is engaging with stakeholders across disciplines and organizations. Some groups - utility services, natural sciences, and environmentally conscious student organizations to name a few - are instinctual partners for green initiatives. However, vast swaths of the campus population are often left out of messages tailored for that audience. The Green Fund at the University of Illinois has begun a series of intentional collaborations with arts and cultural organizations to help widen our own reach, with strong initial success. Our most high-profile collaboration is the Sonified Sustainability Festival, a green concert series that brings together groups as disparate as the Center for Performing Arts, a campus makerspace, and area elementary schools for a shared message of environmental education. Many other successful environmental outreach programs have sprung up in its wake. The session will begin with a few brief case studies and video content examining programs at the University of Illinois, focusing less on our own accomplishments and more on replicable processes. The session will then segue to an interactive component where attendees will ask themselves some of the same questions we did: What groups aren't already an active part of green initiatives on campus? What are their goals and values? How can we help them integrate sustainability into their programs? And perhaps most importantly, what can they teach us?","University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign",4308,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,"events,arts & culture",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Micah Kenfield,Sustainability Programs Coordinator,"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign",4308,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Kenfield_2189.pdf,,,

The Psychology of Sustainability and Social Movement: Student Ecological Citizenship Through a Study Abroad to Malta,"For the past three years, a multidisciplinary group of first and second year honors students have participated in a month-long Psychology of Sustainability trip to Malta. The pre-departure curriculum includes studies on leadership, advocacy, social movements, nature connectedness, community efforts, environmental justice, engaging minority or under-reached populations, health and mental health benefits of the natural world, climate resilience, and psychological barriers to facing environmental issues. Students meet with local environmental groups to examine the roles each of these play in their work. While in Malta students engage in a fully experiential process with nearly a dozen NGOs, learning about how they work separately and together to move sustainability efforts ahead in the tiny island nation, and seek to understand how all the factors listed above are evident in their work as well. Finally, students in engage in a cross-cultural analysis of all the various environmental groups and develop a 'lessons learned' plan to bring back to their campus community as well as weave into their professional leadership and advocacy identity. This poster will present the curriculum, the process, the stories, and outcomes from the 2017 class experience. It will also highlight implications for engaging students in cross-cultural environmental studies.",James Madison University,4345,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,"Social Sciences (Economics, Geography, Political Science, etc)",,"study abroad,Malta,psychology",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Debbie Sturm,Associate Professor,James Madison University,4345,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Campus and Community Partnership: The Results of a Feasibility Study on a Nature Prescription Network,"Emerging research continues to support the notion that exposure to or interaction with nature enhances creativity and vitality, attention and focus, and an overall sense of well being. Nisbet, Zelenski, and Murphy (2010) report nature connectedness is also associated with autonomy, personal growth, purpose in life, positive affect, and overall life satisfaction. Additional studies indicate that connection to the natural world reduces symptoms of ADHD (Kuo & Taylor, 2004), depression, high blood pressure, anxiety and may even enhance the development of motor skills, eyesight, coordination, sensory integration, and empathy (Geller, 1995; Schultz, 2000). In fact, medical providers are incorporating prescriptions for 'Vitamin N' into their work with clients and patients (Louv, 2011).This presentation highlights the process and outcomes of a multi-level feasibility study on the development of a Nature Prescription Network within a small university community in Virginia. This study involved an extensive review of literature, interviews with university of city/county park personnel, medical providers, the hospital system, mental health providers, and community members. The results of the study as well as a park prescription network proposal will be presented. Participants will engage in discussion on how to pursue a network in their community.

Insects as Food: Crawling towards Sustainability through Entomophagy,"Each year our world population grows, on average, by 75 million people. Projected to reach a staggering 9.7 billion people by 2050, earth's resources and the best way to utilize them has become the center of a global debate surrounding food security, water availability and overall sustainability. An increasing demand for meat at home and abroad has driven the expansion of large-scale animal operations and a solution to this urgent request. Somewhere within the folds of this complex conversation emerges the prospect of Entomophagy: embracing insects as a major source of protein in a Western diet. Insects serve as great candidates for sustainable farming as they possess a high conversion rate, require little space, fewer resources and have minimal environmental impact. For example, one gallon of water can produce one pound of cricket protein while it takes up to 2,500 gallons of water to produce the same amount of beef protein. Crickets also require six times less feed and produce 80% less methane than cattle to produce the same amount of protein. High in fiber, healthy fats, protein and essential vitamins and minerals, insects are not only nutritious but delicious as well. Despite these positives and a growing interest in the industry of cricket farming, the United States has been slow to embrace insects as part of a balanced diet. In this presentation, we will explore Entomophagy as a sustainable lifestyle and the potential for its acceptance in the West.",Central Community College,4372,,,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,,,,,entomophagy,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Dr. Crystal Ramm,Ord Learning Center Regional Coordinator,Central Community College,4372,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sustainability and Agricultural Science - A Practical and Combined Effort to Engage and Educate,"Agriculture is the foundation of all sustainability efforts, many don't understand the true connection to our food and fiber systems and how sustainable agriculture production systems are. Being an active agriculturalist and educator I have a passion for educating others about the connection between production agriculture and sustainability. By creating a campus wide campaign to build a greenhouse structure that would inspire local food, introduce technology and sustainability efforts in a grassroots effort to build partnerships and create interest. The project involved the entire Skilled and Technical Departments at Central Community College working in unison to design, build and maintain a working structure that embraces and champions production agriculture and sustainability. Having served as an Agricultural Science Educator for over 20 years and producing crops and livestock as part of my passion for agriculture, this project has given the college a connection to food and fiber systems and engages the community and patrons on a weekly basis. This presentation will allow a chance for someone with a working knowledge of agricultural systems and sustainability efforts to share the stories of obstacles, successes, future goals and a chance to tell the story of real agricultural efforts to tell the sustainability 'story' of our past and our future.

Effects of phase change materials (PCM) on solar thermal storage for season extension agricultural applications,"As part of on-going efforts to use solar and biomass energy for season extension in greenhouses, the NEXUS research group at Appalachian State University is exploring the use of phase change materials (PCMs) to act as thermal storage. PCMs have entered the market in high performance buildings as well as building retrofits. However, there is currently a lack of information in the area of agricultural applications such as season extension. The vast temperature variation of greenhouses or cold frames stand to make the PCM more efficient as the transition temperature of the material is fully achieved through each daily cycle. The research group has built identical three cold frames to test different the effects of two promising PCM technologies (bio-based and salt-hydrate) against a control. Data logging of temperature and relative humidity, are taken in all three cold frames as well as ambient conditions. Solar irradiance is also recorded. Each cold frame will be evaluated by temperature and relative humidity vs. degree days. The goal of this research will be to quantify the storage capacity of these materials and estimate season extension provided by additional thermal storage as well as avoided cost from not having to use electric heating mats for seed germination. Results will be extrapolated for greenhouses to include cost viability. The experiment is in progress during the time of this writing to capture the winter and spring seasons.",Appalachian State University,4398,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Research,,,,solar thermal,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Jeremy Ferrell,Assistant Professor of Sustainable Technology,Appalachian State University,4398,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Applied Sustainability Collaborative: A Virtual Mechanism for Interdisciplinary Engagement with Community,"This proposal discusses a virtual web-based mechanism that connects existing interdisciplinary campus resources with external partners for building collaborative teams to develop and implement solutions to sustainability problems. Through virtual infrastructure, i.e.,database and portal, internal interdisciplinary academic teams, from existing curricular and applied learning programs can connect with external participants to facilitate the development, implementation, and funding of sustainable practices, as well as promote the innovative thinking needed to develop broader sustainable solutions. An initiative like this addresses the primary obstacle that often prevents effective sustainable problem solving: traditional application of knowledge is contained in academic silos. Thus, the implementation of proposed solutions among external organizations is often hindered by an insufficient action plan that requires interdisciplinary expertise to appropriately examine feasibility, viability, and funding considerations. The primary barrier to this collaboration of interdisciplinary knowledge is the lack of a mechanism that can facilitate the development of partnerships among interdisciplinary academic units and community partners. A mechanism that uses virtual rather than physical infrastructure, can overcome the both budgetary and academic barriers to the development of interdisciplinary, collaborative applied learning programs focused on implementing sustainable solutions.",Appalachian State University,4398,,,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Curriculum,,,,"technology,information technology,interdisciplinarity",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Tammy Kowalczyk,Professor,Appalachian State University,4398,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Social Sustainability: University Procurement and Ethical Labor Standards,"Universities are the center of thought leadership, training global leaders and world citizens. Their business practices should reflect the same core values. Expanding on the anti-sweatshop movement that reformed licensed goods, our work is focused on uniting universities in their ethical labor standards through vendor codes of conduct and procurement standards. Sustainability needs to promote the social dimension for our global economy, and universities are positioned to leverage their shared vendors to promote businesses that are transparent and treat all workers in their supply chains with respect that meets high human rights standards. More specifically, students are partnering with faculty and world experts to 1) create ethical procurement standards for universities, and 2) innovate business models that can incorporate human rights without harming their business success. Since March of 2016, leading universities such as Harvard, Georgetown, Columbia, the University of California system, University of Michigan, and more are contributing in their unique roles as administrators, students, professors, sustainability directors, finance officers, human rights experts and more. The first policy implementation is aimed for the fall of 2018, but we are looking for every school to unite in order to make this a truly powerful movement across universities as we leverage cutting research, technology, and procurement management systems to ensure policies are put into practice.",Harvard University,4451,,,,,,,,,,,,,Purchasing,Food & Dining,,,,"labor issues,ethics",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Diana Sheedy,,Harvard University,4451,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Sheedy_3015.pdf,1500_Sheedy_3015_1102_193744.pdf,,
Developing a Green Office Program at your Institution,"Much of our work as sustainability officers is to encourage the campus community to embrace and live an environmentally sustainable lifestyle, While oftentimes initiatives will target students, eco-conscious purchasing and office practices on behalf of faculty and staff are of tantamount importance.

The aim of this presentation is to inspire sustainability professionals to consider all of the steps involved in creating campus waste initiatives, which include but are not limited to: engaging students, faculty and staff, working closely with your Facilities staff and potentially your city waste division, and having the data available to show the impact of your work and the potential impact of newly developed initiatives.",Harvey Mudd College,4452,,,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Food & Dining,,,"zero waste,compost,getting started,waste diversion",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Louis Spanias,Sustainability Program Manager,Harvey Mudd College,4452,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Spanias_2566.pdf,,,
The Intersection Between Sustainability and Human Health,"The Environmental Health Committee is part of the University of Arizona's Students for Sustainability organization. It consists of thirteen students who work together to implement projects involving sustainability and the impacts on personal and community health. The Environmental Health committee is the newest addition to the Students for Sustainability with our initial projects starting in Fall 2016. The committee's first project was the Environmental Health Panel which featured a group of professionals from the UA College of Public Health. We explored various topics including how health is impacted by environmental changes including air pollution, water quality, and disease transmission. The discussion focused on global, national, and local issues all with an underlying theme of social justice. In the following semesters, the Environmental Health committee intends to focus on implementing permanent programs within the University, including working with the U of A Parking and Transportation Services, creating a mental health and nature series with the Community Garden, and projects that will address the health of the homeless population of Tucson in an environmentally friendly way. This presentation will involve breakout sessions that explore topics in sustainability and how they relate back to human health along with a follow up discussion on how health is undeniably tied with the protection of our environment.",University of Arizona,4465,,,,,,,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,,,"human health,student organizations",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Sara Bertram,Student,University of Arizona,4465,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Building a community of practice for applied learning for sustainability practitioners,"This meeting brings leaders and stakeholders interested in applied learning programs for sustainability outcomes together-catalyzing the development of a group of peers interested in collaborating on this topic. The meeting builds on a networking session that was held with over 25 participants in 2016 and workshops held on this topic in 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Building effective applied learning for sustainability programs means to grow a program that transitions from individual projects to comprehensive programs while designing educational experiences, which balance student development with community impact. This process typically evolves over 4 phases: preparation, kick-off, acceleration, and institutionalization. We expect that participants will identify with one of the phases. Thus, to start building a community of peers, participants meet in the phase that best describes the situation at their institution. With the help of a facilitator, they network and exchange experiences and good practice pertinent to their context and how to prepare for moving to the next phase. After a few iterations, everyone comes to the plenary to report back and discuss ideas for moving forward in building a community. The hope would be that this session also helps forge some initial collaborations among participants that will continue beyond the session and into the work year.",Arizona State University,4531,,,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,"applied learning,community engagement,peer-to-peer",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Katja Brundiers,Research Assistant Professor,Arizona State University,4531,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How to Streamline and Scale your Sustainability Certification Program,"Do you have green certifications to encourage and reward sustainability efforts on campus?? Do you manually send the results or certifications? Do you get live data for analysis that shows how many people have answered each question? In an effort to streamline and scale our program, we moved our certification program to Blackboard. In this presentation, we will provide a walk-through of the program on Blackboard and review the pros and cons.

Art for Science Community Challenge 2018: Climate Disruption,The 2017 March for Science was an unprecedented event of scientists and science advocates stepping out of the laboratories and into the avenues. Pennsylvania Avenue to be exact was the epicenter of these heroes of earth quaking to defend the role of science in policy and society. But was this event effective or only an echo chamber? How can a larger community advocate for scientists so scientists can be scientists?

Beyond Interpersonal Competence: Teaching and Learning Professional Skills in Sustainability,"Successful careers in sustainability are determined by positive real-world change towards sustainability. This success depends on professional skills in effective and compassionate communication, collaborative teamwork, or impactful stakeholder engagement, among others. These professional skills extend beyond content knowledge and methodical expertise. Current sustainability programs can do more to facilitate students' acquisition of such skills. This session starts with a brief presentation of the major domains of professional skills and their relevance for sustainability professional. It gives examples of activities to teach/learn these skills and shares lessons learned for future course development. The presentation is followed by an interactive discussion aimed at exchanging experiences of teaching and learning professional skills in sustainability. Session participants are invited to share the activities and assignments that they have found effective in their own practice.

RightCycle: Comprehensive Recycling System at Arizona State University,"Although many products are potentially eligible for recycling, a countless number of recyclable products is being thrown away in trash bins in which ends up in landfills. There are abundant laboratories (biology, chemistry, research, academic, educational) that are still throwing out used gloves into the trash that only contributes to creating more sustainability wicked problems. Arizona State University currently has nearly 100,000 students enrolled and is considered as one of the largest universities in terms of student body. Laboratory course is a requirement for most students to earn a degree. Hence, the number of gloves used daily is enormous. RightCycle program at Arizona State University shows how business and campus can collaborate to contribute towards sustainable society. The purpose of this poster is to share how the introduction of such program implements the knowledge of engaging sustainable practices into its population.

Simply because of where we work, we may be at an advantage or disadvantage when it comes to engaging with our communities. Are we seen as respected experts in our field or know-it-all liberals? If a community member states, 'Oh, wow! I didn't think you worked at [name your institution]', is that taken as an insult or a compliment? In this session, participants will be challenged to think critically about their role in the community, particularly with individuals that are not like-minded.

Diversion Drama: A Waste Study in Residence Halls,"This spring the Skidmore Sustainability Office launched a waste study for four residence halls, which house a fourth of the on-campus student population. Preliminary waste assessments indicated that 50-60% of material in residence hall landfill bins was recyclable, and when students were off campus, college-wide diversion rates increased 20%. With support and input from Facilities, Housekeeping, and Residential Life, we began implementing changes: one residence area served as a control, the second incorporated improved waste infrastructure, the third received educational outreach and the fourth had both infrastructure and educational outreach. To improve infrastructure, additional signage was implemented and 41-quart trash bins were replaced with 2-quart bins. Student sustainability representatives were tasked with spearheading recycling surveys, outreach, and monthly audits. This study gave our Sustainability Office an opportunity to strengthen partnerships with Residence Life, collaborate with Facilities and Housekeeping, and it gave us insights on how to revitalize waste efforts in residence areas across campus.",Skidmore College,4696,,,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,"residence halls,recycling",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Jennifer Natyzak,Sustainability Fellow,Skidmore College,4696,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Environmental Education from the Caribbean to the Carolinas,"I have compared environmental education (EE) programs at USC, the greater Columbia area, and at tourist sites in St. Lucia in order to determine what methods of EE most effectively teach the public. I used surveys and attended some lessons in order to best understand each program and evaluate their success. Camp GLEA is a camp hosted by Sustainable Carolina at USC to teach Gardening and Literacy Education through the Arts. Kids learn the importance of gardening and environmental stewardship by helping in our garden, cooking what they harvest, and using their own artistic representation to depict nature. Additionally, I attended and helped lead several EE programs at Harbison State Forest. Thirdly, I explored how individuals are educated about the environment in various tourist sites around St. Lucia. These different programs will reach a wide variety of individuals. Kids of Camp GLEA come from underprivileged households while the other two South Carolina camps have more privileged individuals. St. Lucia will provide yet more diversity in age, culture, language, and social status. My presentation will provide conference attendees with a better understanding of successful methodologies to engage a variety of audiences in environmental education. They will also understand the importance of using an assessment to truly understand the success of a program and will be aware of programs, both educational and political, in St. Lucia and the rest of the Caribbean.",University of South Carolina,4756,,,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Curriculum,,,,"tourism,recreation",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Max Ciarlone,LEAD Intern at Sustainable Carolina,University of South Carolina,4756,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beyond the Triple Bottom Line; An Alternative Framework for Sustainability,"At nearly 25 years old, Elkington's triple bottom line is nearing obsolesce. While laudable in its intent to promote full cost accounting, the TBL's inherent focus on the economic sphere relegates the social and environmental spheres to externalities, in practice if not in word. To unwary organizations and individuals, the TBL's lack of applicability leads it to become little more than an organizational tool for greenwashing. In its place, new approaches, such as the Circles of Sustainability framework, show remarkable promise in not only promoting, but also operationalizing and assessing sustainability. Endorsed by the UN Global Compact Cities Programme, and tested in six major metropolises, the Circles of Sustainability framework is divided into four categories: economics, politics, ecology, and culture. These four categories, in turn, form an interconnected social domain, which is itself grounded within the natural world. By demoting economics to a sphere within the social domain, the Circles of Sustainability approach is better able illuminate each sphere and how they relate, in Paul James's words, 'to a systematic understanding of the social whole.' In this presentation, we apply the Circles of Sustainability framework, to a seventh city Charleston, South Carolina. As a rapidly developing (and gentrifying) coastal city with a history of civil rights challenges, Charleston is an ideal case study of the applicability and usefulness of this new approach.",College of Charleston,5047,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Coordination & Planning,,,,triple bottom line,10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Craig Bennett,,College of Charleston,5047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Bennett_2645.pptx,,,
How Learning Interdependently in Outdoor Settings can Induce a Paradigm Shift & Foster a Yearn to Protect the Natural World,"As a vice president of the College of Charleston's Outdoors Club and long-time outdoor enthusiast, I have found that exposing people to the natural world has been one of the most prominent catalysts in creating an appreciation and love for it. Segments of society have evolved a profound disconnection with nature, which allows people to live out their lives 'business as usual' without seeing the implications of their actions. Problem solving and taking on new experiences in the outdoors with groups of people caters to self-discovery, a sense of spirituality, and allows the stripping down of material comforts, which most come to realize they are happier without. One holistically learns about themselves as along with the beauty and processes of what sustains life and modestly surrounds us every day. Team-building and experiential learning out of the classroom have proven to be most of the most effective and progressive ways to absorb new information and provide a route to apply knowledge to help better the world. This is apropos to sustainability and education because it engages people in rigorous learning while committing to living intentionally and prioritizing community while being aware and mindful of our actions towards each other and the planet rooted in a sense of empathy and personal experience.",College of Charleston,5047,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,"nature,recreation,outdoor learning",10/15/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Ashley Lavender,"Intern and Student Coordinator, Office of Sustainability",College of Charleston,5047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1130_Lavender_2751.pptx,,,
Bicycle Parking Assessment at the College of Charleston,"The College of Charleston's Sustainable Transportation Program, managed by the College's Office of Sustainability, is dedicated to providing accessible transportation options for students as well as advocating for a bike and pedestrian friendly community. In addition to maintaining a small bike share program, the STP promotes bike safety, hosts bike maintenance workshops, and works with other campus and community organizations. Although the program started with only 8 bikes, it has grown beyond its bike share origins to include collaborative projects with other offices across campus, such as Facilities Planning. One of the most recent projects, beginning in the fall of 2015, is a tri-color bike rack scheme meant to reduce bike parking congestion in the high-traffic areas of campus as identified in the College's 2013 Transportation Report. This project involves reserving certain colors of racks for certain users; black being for general use, maroon for residential use, and gold for commuter use. During the summer and fall of 2016 a trial run of the project was implemented on a single block of campus. Preliminary assessments show that this project has been highly effective in reducing bike parking congestion and has a generally-high favorability rating among users. Because of these positive results, the STP will likely be expanding this project into other problem areas on campus.",College of Charleston,5047,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation,Coordination & Planning,,,,"bikes,parking,assessment",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Logan Johnson,Bike Share Senior Intern,College of Charleston,5047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Street Harassment Assessment at the College of Charleston,"Colleges and universities in urban areas are made up of many different types of environments. The nonprofit organization Stop Street Harassment, defines street harassment as 'unwanted whistling, leering, sexist, homophobic or transphobic slurs, persistent requests for someone's name, number or destination after they've said no, sexual names, comments and demands, following, flashing, public masturbation, groping, sexual assault, and rape'. Students attending school in a midsize urban area such as Charleston, South Carolina are likely to be exposed to street harassment. Street harassment can affect the way students learn, communicate, and interact on campus with their peers. The aim of this research is to display street harassment that the students at the College of Charleston face. This research will be used to create a safer college experience for all students.

"An Introduction to the Role of Race, Class and Gender Issues On Campus Sustainability Work","This introductory session explores the powerfully important ways that dynamics of race, class and gender (RCG) impact the efficacy of our campus sustainability work, and then suggests how a racial justice, economic justice, and gender justice framework can substantially deepen that very same work. The session begins with a brief framing of the connection between RCG issues and sustainability, followed by the outlining of a social justice lens that can be used address them. The session utilizes reflective writing, paired discussion and small group conversation to foster participant engagement and is best suited for those with very little understanding of social justice issues.",Hackman Consulting Group,5108,,,,,,,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,"gender,race & ethnicity,social justice",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Heather Hackman,Founder and President,Hackman Consulting Group,5108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To Come Together, We Must Transform What's Divided Us: Utilizing a Social Justice Lens for Collective Campus Sustainability Work","As evidenced over the last 24 months, a lack of critical understanding of social justice issues makes collaborative work across multiple lines of identity near impossible, while thoughtful attention to social justice issues can build unexpected and highly effective coalitions. The former, of course, works in opposition to the urgent need for solidarity with respect to climate, environmental and sustainability issues, thus highlighting the importance of utilizing a social justice lens in our sustainability work. As such, this cross-disciplinary workshop is designed to take campus sustainability work to a deeper level, via the use of a critical 'social justice lens' (SJL), so as to improve its efficacy, deepen its reach and power, and ultimately align it more closely with 21st century climate realities. Based on workshops Dr. Hackman has presented across the country, this interactive session begins by setting forth the core components of a critical SJL, then makes explicit connections for its use and transformative import in this current climate change / sustainability moment, and concludes with the presentation of concrete steps regarding the application of a SJL to sustainability work on our campuses via case studies and participant examples. The session is grounded in theory (for a shared framework), but spends the bulk of its time in dialogue, application and integration of the content into participants' specific settings.

"In Serving Solidarity, Let's Talk about Privilege: Critical Conversations About 'Unsustainable' Race, Class & Gender Privilege","While attention to the ways dynamics of racism, classism and gender oppression target people of color and native people, poor and working class people, and cisgender women and trans* folks is critically important to our sustainability work, too often the 'other side' of these dynamics are left invisible and thus unchallenged and unchanged. More specifically, while some campuses are willing to consider the impacts of racism on their sustainability work, less frequent is the willingness to look at the ways white privilege has impacted that work. This half-day workshop is designed to help participants dive more deeply into the complicated and often fraught conversation about race, class and gender privilege in the service of developing more collaborative campus sustainability efforts. To be sure this is not a session mired in guilt, shame and blame, and instead: 1) explores these dynamics of privilege through a social justice lens, 2) identifies the unconscious and unintentional ways race, class and gender privilege thwart collective sustainability work on our campuses, 3) suggests ways to interrupt and dismantle these privileged dynamics, and then 4) connects this social justice work to the creation of effective and forward-thinking campus sustainability efforts.

Consumer Recycling Attitudes and Behaviors,"Keep America Beautiful conducted a nationwide survey in October 2016 to study people's recycling attitudes and behaviors. The goal of the project was to better understand how to overcome barriers and motivate greater recycling participation. A key theme from survey responses is that most people want to recycle but are sometimes prevented because of confusion, lack of convenience or skepticism that making the effort will actually benefit the environment.

Creating a culture of operational visibility: the data-driven future of campus operations,"Vladi will explain how, by implementing cost-effective energy-efficiency measures, many colleges and universities have the potential to cut their energy bills by 30 percent or more. Yet campus sustainability practitioners are often faced with small teams, and little access to financial resources. This challenge makes it hard to develop the necessary programs and initiatives necessary to achieve their efficiency and sustainability goals. Vladi has spent decades addressing this very issue - first as a university practitioner himself, and then later as the head of a company that provides a data and analytics platform to help organizations optimize the performance of their buildings. Vladi will share time-tested strategies and methods to strengthen alignment on energy and sustainability initiatives across multiple, disparate stakeholders, from students to faculty to finance. He will also share stories from across his customer base to illustrate how sustainability and facility managers and their counterparts can elevate their roles and provide new types of hard-hitting information to help secure more budget. Attendees will walk away from this session with a firm understanding of: How to implement building intelligence technology to centralize campus building data and facilitate a dialogue between students, administration, facilities, and beyond Strategies that can be put into place immediately to foster",Lucid,5709,,,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Energy,,,,"energy reduction,metrics,energy management",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Kadri Jugandi,,Lucid,5709,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lean Green Financing at MSIs,"In the rapidly evolving field of sustainability, both new technology and financing mechanisms are opening possibilities for green projects on campuses previously perceived as unattainable. Over the past three years, Huston-Tillotson University has undertaken a number of campus sustainability projects to improve efficiency and reduce our footprint, e.g., rooftop solar, occupancy sensors, and efficient appliances. As an under-resourced historically black university, we have investigated and leveraged a wide variety of financial mechanisms including leases, grant writing, fundraising, sponsorships, and more. Additionally, we continue to explore non-traditional solutions and innovative ways to finance projects, including such mechanisms as a non-fee based green revolving fund. In this session, we will share a few case studies of successful financing mechanisms, the on-going challenges, and critical partnerships that continue to enable sustainability projects under lean circumstances.",Huston-Tillotson University,6112,,,,,,,,,,,,,Investment & Finance,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,,,"green funds,revolving funds,msi institutions",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Karen Magid,Director of Sustainability,Huston-Tillotson University,6112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Magid_2529.pdf,,,

Emphasizing Diversity and Equity in Your Sustainability Narrative,"As practitioners of sustainability, too often we take an approach that applies the dominant cultural sustainability paradigm (personal sustainability efforts and outdoor activities) and excludes social inequity (human and environmental health and systemic environmental racism). We work to create equitable solutions and to tailor our projects to our stakeholders; however, the siloed nature of the institution can pose a barrier to this approach, particularly when your institution is underfunded. In this presentation we'll tell the story of creating Chemeketa Community College's sustainability narrative, incorporating our existing history, connecting to our diversity and equity programs, and our ongoing challenge to build social justice into our sustainability programs. Our approach includes using mapping your institution's diversity and equity programs, employing active listening skills, and checking stakeholder involvement for diversity to work towards long-term collaborations that both build a strong body of support for environmental programs and contribute to social justice.

"Innovatively Adding The Skills That Tomorrow's Workers Need, Into Today's Curriculum","Sustainability is a topic that is constantly changing. Regulations are changing constantly and the market is moving so fast that the skills that entry level employees need is shifting so fast that institutions are struggling to keep up. Skills such as calculating a GHG Inventory, answering the Wal-Mart Scorecard, Running a Green Team or helping an organization set its Vision and Goals on Sustainability, which used to be cutting edge are now table stakes skills for most new hires in this space. Meanwhile, instructors are typically overburdened and don't have the time to attend trainings, and develop their own skills based materials, unless they are given time and stipends to go off and do so. That is where 'Sustainability Skill Modules' come into play. Instead of offering new courses, Institutions need to find ways to easily, efficiently, and cheaply integrate this instruction into existing courses, in a way that faculty can excel at delivering. This presentation will discuss how to overcome common obstacles and keys to success from the presenter's work with 12 colleges and universities in this area. Moreover, the presenter will also highlight the results from his firm's research with 100+ organizations as to the type of skills they are seeking in tomorrow's workforce - the hard, soft & sustainability specific skills.

Sustainable Food Systems: Increasing Local Food Procurement on Campus,"Increasing local food procurement represents an opportunity for post-secondary institutions to enhance campus sustainability, improve the student experience, and have a greater positive impact on the regional economy. Mohawk College has partnered with the Ontario Greenbelt Fund to develop a local food procurement framework that can be adopted at Ontario's 24 colleges and other broader public sector institutions. The project is comprised of three phases: industry research (1), pilot projects (2), and the development of a scalable, transferable local food procurement framework (3). This local food procurement model responds directly to barriers to local food procurement at college foodservices operations and proposes the evolution of the relationship between client institutions and their third-party foodservices operators. The presentation will share key strategies and lessons learned in the project's research and pilot implementation phases, and will engage the audience in a discussion about innovative local food procurement solutions in colleges and universities.",Mohawk College,6363,,,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,,"local foods,food systems",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Emily Baynes,"Interim Manager, Sustainability",Mohawk College,6363,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By Impacting Hearts and Minds, Emergent Leadership Transforms Brick and Mortar Projects Into Much More","If conventional leadership was all that was needed to create a truly sustainable built environment - one that generates choices equitably -- we would be there already. This presentation offers the opportunity to explore a strategic leadership approach intended to impact hearts and minds as well as brick and mortar, thus ensuring long lasting and equitable adoption of sustainable principles and practice. Every green building project is an opportunity to conserve resources, protect human health, provide access to nature, and educate building users. Some projects stand out, however, as they have also inspired new business models, created jobs, instigated technological innovation, offered equity to the marginalized, served as a source of civic pride, fostered collaboration among diverse parties, and more. This presentation will begin with case studies revealing the potential of sustainability projects to transform not just physical environments, but everyone involved in planning, developing, operating, maintaining, and utilizing them. With these examples as inspiration, the presentation will describe the concept of emergent leadership and show how it can be applied in collaborative projects to foster positive and enduring change.

"Multi Modal Sustainability FREE My Open Road App - A Great Tool to Reduce Carbon Footprint, Get Fit & Get Rewarded","My Open Road is a multimodal sustainability FREE mobile app that can help universities, MPOs to: Reduce traffic congestion; Encourage healthy lifestyles; Measure and record reductions in carbon emissions; Raise awareness about climate change. We can do this by encouraging users via the My Open Road FREE mobile app to make sustainable/active transportation fun (by walking, running, biking, skateboarding, taking public transit, driving hybrid or electric cars, etc.). By using the app, users can reduce their carbon footprint, get fit and get rewarded for their efforts in saving the planet. My Open Road recently partnered with Wilmington Master Planning Organization (WMPO) in North Carolina to conduct a two-week commute challenge in October 2016. They used the My Open Road App for the challenge to encourage their people to take sustainable/active transportation when going to work, to school, and out for errands. Those that saved the most CO2 emissions won great prizes for each sustainable transportation modes (walking/running, biking, skateboarding, taking the bus, driving hybrid or electric cars). 29,718 ecomiles were traveled, 1,878 trips were recorded, and by taking sustainable transportation, the participants prevented 16,038 pounds of CO2 from being emitted into the air during the two-week challenge.

Activities on campus sustainability for solidarity in Japan - A Case Study: The Green Program in Fukushima -,"Involvement of many people is a key to establish sustainable campus as well as taking advantage of advanced technology. However, it is very difficult for us today to unite for campus sustainability because each of students and staff members has different interest and lifestyle. Japanese universities which belong to CAS-Net JAPAN are discussing what to do to promote solidarity for campus sustainability. CAS-Net JAPAN is an organization aiming for establishment of sustainable campus and society in Japan and mainly consists of Japanese universities. At this presentation, we would like to focus a case study named 'The Green Program in Fukushima'. National Institute of Technology, Fukushima College implemented this program this August for the first time under the cooperation with a public institution named 'The Green Program' in the U.S. We invited 20 graduate and under graduae students from the U.S. and other countries to show the rehabilitation process in Fukushima Prefecture after the Great East-Japan Earthquake & Tsunami and the explosion of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant dameged our area heavily six and half years ago.

Reducing our Carbon Footprint: A Simple Solution to Cutting Car Reliance on University Campuses,"After the US pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement, over 180 universities signed the 'We Are Still In' pledge to uphold the terms of the Paris Climate Agreement to lessen their carbon footprints. DoubleMap saw the need to create an affordable shuttle service from university campuses to regional cities and airports during times of high demand (Spring Break, Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc). By working with university SGA's to subsidize student ticket prices, they are able to create a cost-effect and competitive model that uses GPS data to track busses in real-time through web-based and phone applications. By creating a service that specifically targets universities, they are able to help campuses create a lasting impact by reducing car reliance, lessening parking and traffic congestion, and decreasing fuel emissions.","DoubleMap, Inc.",6899,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation,,,,,"alternative transportation,Paris Climate Agreement,public transit",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Peter SerVaas,President,"DoubleMap, Inc.",6899,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_SerVaas.pptx,,,

Techniques to Foster Interpersonal Competences,"Interpersonal Competences (ICs) are vital for sustainability change agents. Evidence shows that ICs are also highly-prized career skills. A student with strong ICs can productively interact and empathize with collaborators and stakeholders from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. ICs allow students to effectively learn from and teach others across different values and cultures, negotiate conflicts, and facilitate effective community decision-making. Organizational Development consultants and others have designed and used facilitation techniques for interpersonal work in industry, governance and NGOs. However, these techniques are not yet widely implemented in formal education settings, and ICs are rarely explicitly addressed in pedagogy. It is therefore imperative to improve ICs development in higher education. This session reviews some widely-used strategies and promising innovations to foster ICs. It demonstrates teachable tools for: improving communication framing and story-telling; promoting constructive dialogue and small-group conversations; and facilitating information-sharing, collaboration and decision-making in large groups. Such tools for group process and information sharing can enhance every student's ICs, promoting student success across all disciplines and career paths. We will consider and practice a selection of strategies synthesized from Organizational Development, to help educators from all disciplines foster ICs in sustainability education.",Nanyang Technological University,7025,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Wellbeing & Work,,,,"professional development,sustainability officers,communications",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Michelle Merrill,Advisory Board; independent researcher and consultant,Nanyang Technological University,7025,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Merrill.pdf,1445_Merrill.pptx,,
"Materials Health and Transparency: The Social, Physical, and Environmental Impacts","Material health and transparency are not only issues of sustainable building, but also social justice and public health. Building construction has both upstream and downstream consequences to people and communities. From raw material extraction to end-of-life, construction materials and building products have human health & environmental impacts. These impacts include toxic chemical exposure, depletion of natural resources, habitat reduction, and pollution. Today's students are familiar with related issues of chemical health hazards in their personal care items and food. We seek to close the loop in demanding transparency in not only what we put on our bodies and into our bodies, but also in the built environments our bodies inhabit. This session will highlight the importance of raising awareness about chemicals of concern as a form of sustainable practice for campus communities and as a way to redress the systemic inequities that adversely affect the communities outside of campus where these chemicals and products are extracted, processed, or made.

Beyond Offsetting: Onsetting Scope 3 Emissions and Supporting Innovative Local Projects,"Universities struggle to find meaningful ways to address their Scope 3 emissions, especially with regard to staff travel and study abroad. This session will explain carbon onsetting as a positive alternative to carbon offsetting and how schools can use this system to support local, innovative projects within Second Nature's Climate and Resilience Commitments. While carbon offsetting can help students understand their emissions, it is an inefficient and non-transparent system with the implicit message that it is possible to 'buy a clean conscience while delaying meaningful action.' Carbon onsetting resolves these challenges by 1) pricing emissions based on the best scientific evidence of the Social Cost of Carbon; 2) dropping the controversial concept of carbon neutrality in order to broaden how we perceive and respond to climate change; and 3) moving beyond individual actions and focusing on systemic and collective change. Onsetting helps schools address their unavoidable emissions while focusing on what they do best -- educating the next generation of leaders for a better world.",Earth Deeds,7214,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation,Air & Climate,Campus Engagement,,,"air travel,carbon offsets",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Daniel Greenberg,Director,Earth Deeds,7214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How to achieve Silver in STARS and not die trying?,"Sustainability is something quite new in universities in Latin America, specifically in Mexico. Since the launch of STARS as a pilot in 2011 our university decided we wanted to be part of it. In 2015 when the pilot was officially a program we did the assessment and finally achieve Bronze. People at our university were really excited about this achievement but knew a little about what sustainability is. The goal for UDEM is to be Gold by 2020, and the challenge is to engage everyone whom contributes to the STARS report to do a little more without an extra pay. How can you engage people from Faculty, Maintenance and Construction, Purchases, Finance and many others when the Sustainability Centre is part of the Students Affairs? The journey has not been easy and I have faced many obstacles. When dealing with faculty is hard to explain and engage them to include in their syllabus sustainability, many times faculty do not consider this as a priority. What I faced when dealing with operations is a lack of information and most of the time they do not have a plan, they just live from hand to mouth, and last but not least Administration, not everything works the same outside the US and Canada, and not everyone is willing to make all information public.

"16 Billion Trees Fell Last Year, Is Anyone Listening?","Poster will detail impacts and risks of deforestation; opportunities for reducing paper use and example of easy solution to add to your sustainability efforts to reduce impact on deforestation, climate change and promote the circular economy. Forest provide trillions in free environmental services from clean air and water filtration to CO2 sequestration. There are about 3 trillion trees on the earth - as many as 16 billion trees are harvested annually. Deforestation and forest degradation account for anywhere between 10% - 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In 2016, institutional investors with $22 trillion in assets requested that companies report data about forest risks through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). According to the report, Revenue at Risk: Why Addressing Deforestation Is Critical to Business Success, the total annual turnover at risk for publicly listed companies is estimated to be up to $906 billion. In 2010 the Board of Directors of the Consumer Goods Forum approved a resolution to achieve zero net deforestation by 2020. The aim is to achieve this through the responsible sourcing of the following key commodities: soy, palm oil, paper and pulp and beef. Dozens of governments, scores of international corporations and more than 50 Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) signed the New York Declaration on Forests in 2014. The goal of this non-binding agreement is to reduce forest loss by halve, end it by 2030 and restore forest lands by an area larger than India. Meeting these goals would cut between 4.5 and 8.8 billion tons of carbon annually.

"Corrugated Pallets: How Campus Procurement Policies Can Drive National Change to Reduce Emissions, Advance Zero Waste, and Protect Employees","Change the Pallet is a national non-profit dedicated to reducing carbon emissions massively through education and advocacy with respect to the tremendous environmental benefits of corrugated paper pallets vs. traditional wood pallets. Our presentation will describe how a national shift from wood to lightweight, recyclable corrugated pallets can reduce emissions, save billions of dollars, protect workers, and take trucks off the road. More importantly, we will explain the crucial role that our nation's campuses can play in driving scalable and durable systemic change to achieve these goals. In the process, we will demonstrate how colleges, U.S. municipalities, states, and private companies can meet their sustainability goals, reduce their carbon footprint, and save money by simply changing the pallet they receive from vendors. We will show how our research is grounded not just in theory, but in practice. Specifically, we will present how one leading company has saved billions of dollars, reduced its truck requirements by more than 20% globally, and reduced emissions by a reported 500,000+ metric tons since instituting a company-wide shift from wood to paper pallets in 2012. We will make the case that anyone who receives pallets from vendors and suppliers can likewise reduce costs and emissions, advance zero waste goals and improve workplace safety by making basic procurement policy changes that are well within their reach and prerogative. Indeed, General Motors required vendors to ship to their facilities on corrugated pallets for 17 years! Our position and propositions are straightforward: if GM could tell its suppliers to ship to their 'campuses' on lightweight, recyclable corrugated pallets, universities and colleges can and should follow suit.",Change the Pallet,7553,,,,,,,,,,,,,Purchasing,Air & Climate,Waste,,,supply chains,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Adam Pener,Executive Director,Change the Pallet,7553,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Literally Breaking Down Walls (Roofs and Floors too).

In a highly specialized industry, finding common ground and an effective communication protocol among owners, designers, consultants, builders, and tradesman can prove to be difficult which can decrease the intended service life of a building or increase the operational and maintenance cost. This session will combine insight and experience from the perspective of owners and consultants on how best to achieve possibly the most critical component of any sustainable building: the enclosure. The presenters will speak from real-world experience to take the audience on a journey through the design and construction of high performance and effective building enclosures from schematic design through operation. Establishing solidarity among the many members of the design and construction team is a critical step to ensuring smooth communication and conflict resolution. In an effort to translate owner-established goals into a physical built product, the consultants will discuss the well-established quality-based processes utilized to ensure project goals are met.

The Internet of Things (IoT) and the Student Experience: Sustainability by Design,"Every day we hear of a new technology that is Internet-connected, enabled, enhanced! If they can afford it, college students are eager first adopters of these gadgets and their applications. However, College and University planners are challenged by the exploding demand for network bandwidth, as more and more devices are added to campuses. Is this trend sustainable, and how can we embrace it responsibly? Besides the obvious expansion of bandwidth demand from social media, streaming video, and Wi-Fi phone calls, there are many new devices and applications being added to the mix. Wearable technologies such as smart watches and biometric-enabled clothing and footwear, wireless group collaboration technologies, and GPS-enabled social media run silently in the background of the fabric of the campus. How can higher education professionals form a framework for these ideas, and adopt responsible plans that are not 'greenwash?' To this end, the ICT Industry (Information Communications Technology), through professional associations, have been developing national standards in the area of technology sustainability for several years now. New and emerging standards build on existing guidelines such as LEED, and include standards for data centers, networks, and smart buildings. This session will introduce how Higher Education planners can specify these standards when developing new and renovated building plans. Continuing operations and occupant engagement standards will also be explored.",The Sextant Group,7854,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,"technology,information technology,occupant engagement",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,"Joseph Bocchiaro III, PhD",Principal Consultant,The Sextant Group,7854,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_BocchiaroIIIPhD_2582.pdf,,,
In Their Own Words and by the Numbers: A Mixed -Methods Study of the Advancement of Sustainability in American Higher Education,"A call for the urgent implication due to the increasingly hostile environment is pressing. All social sectors should respond to the change with active participation. Notably, 'higher education institutions are being asked to become leaders and role models in the adoption and communication of sustainable practices' (McNamara, 2010, p. 1). In January of 2003, the National Council for Science and the Environment released its Recommendations for Education for a Sustainable and Secure Future, a document written to 'shape the upcoming United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (McNamara, 2010, p. 1).' It Believed that educational institutions are 'uniquely positioned to help solve the challenges of environmental, social, and economic sustainability through innovations in teaching' (p. 5, as cited in McNamara, 2010, p. 1). Today, fourteen years after the release of this report and two years after the completion of Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, to what extent has the higher education institutions respond to the call? The intent of this research study is to learn about ways of fostering sustainability in colleges and universities who participate in the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS) program host by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE). Also, it aims to provide a guiding tool to the universities who have not joined the program due to lack of institutional support.",Florida Atlantic University,7952,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Campus Engagement,,,,"Education for Sustainable Development,Decade of Education for Sustainable Development",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Qingqing Chui,,Florida Atlantic University,7952,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of smoke exposure on the germination of native plant species of North America,"Smoke exposure is known to influence germination of a wide variety of species. However, the influence of smoke on germination of grasses is poorly studied. In order to investigate the influence of smoke on grasses native to North America, we tested five species for germination response to smoke exposure. Species tested were: sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), buffalo grass (Bouteloua dactyloides), American basket flower (Centaurea americana), and different varieties of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentate). Seeds were treated with one of four dilutions of smoke-water and distilled water: 0:1 (no smoke), 1:10 (high smoke), 1:100 (medium smoke), and 1:1000 (low smoke). Seeds were soaked in the smoke treatment for 20 hours, then placed in a germination chamber. Multiple germination chamber will be needed because some of the seeds required different growing conditions to mimic their time of germination. We monitored the seeds daily for germination. We hope to find that germination is inhibited in some species and promoted in others at different levels of smoke exposure. We perceive this happening because of past test performed on similar species to the ones that we are studying. It is our hope that wee exhibit that different levels of smoke exposure could have a significant effect on germination of many grass species in North America.",Texas Tech University,8002,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Grounds,,,,native plants,10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,ian smith,student,Texas Tech University,8002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Operations Research Applications in Sustainability Coursework Design,"Four major topics are listed for coursework design across academic departments (1) prairie restoration (2) plant-based industry (3) clean energy (4)population growth rate. Climate change adaptation may include: increased O2 output, decreased GHGs output and carbon expenditure reduction. Operations Research typically is the subject matter of industrial engineering departments of major universities. Computational techniques outlining complex systems, decision-making simulation, information theory, queuing, multi-criteria optimization, design and approximation may be employed to design optimal coursework in particular university settings. Utilizing a mathematical backbone affords coursework design as well as an embedded trainer for students and professionals entering the workforce. Cross-discipline methodologies allow various academic entities a potent tool to create classroom and laboratory tasks to achieve sustainability goals. Examples include simple matrix calculations to more complex heuristic models incorporating combinatorial determinations. For instance, coursework detailing Prairie restoration might involve eigenvalue computations, plant-based industrial planning may best be served by techniques in statistical quality control, clean energy coursework can employ OR methods like approximation algorithms. Global human population growth rate reduction may involve medical OR.

Disruptive Tech: Beyond Net Zero Energy Onsite Water Reuse,"In addition to water scarcity, drivers to consider water reuse now include aging or inadequate infrastructure, resiliency, resource recovery and increasing costs for conventional water and sewer. Many communities are responding by incorporating onsite water treatment and reuse systems for both existing and new-build projects. As water reuse initiatives increase, more focus is being directed to the water-energy nexus; which is the relationship between how much water is used to generate and transmit energy, and how much energy it takes to collect, clean, transport and store water. Onsite or distributed systems are located closer to the source and point of use, which facilitates local recovery of both water and thermal energy embedded in the water. Natural Systems Utilities is currently recovering thermal energy from treated wastewater at its onsite treatment and reuse systems. Three case studies will be reviewed in detail, including The New School University in NYC, a 40,000 Gallon Per Day (GPD) in building water reuse system that will reduce the new academic buildings water footprint by approximately 75%.",Natural Systems Utilities,8228,,,,,,,,,,,,,Water,Energy,Water,,,"water treatment,water use,water reclamation",10/16/2017,AASHE,Presentation,"Zach Gallagher, PE, LEED AP",Executive Vice President,Natural Systems Utilities,8228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Bee Campus USA: Making the World Safer for Pollinators, One Campus at a a Time","Pollinators are responsible for 1 in 3 bites of food we consume-actually, the most nutritious and, some say, delicious bites! Equally important, pollinators are responsible for the reproduction of 90% of the world's wild plant species, plants that are critical to sustaining broader biodiversity generally. However, a 2016 U.N. report estimated that about 40% of invertebrate pollinator species are facing extinction, particularly bees and butterflies. The Bee Campus USA program launched in spring 2015 to engage academic institutions in pollinator advocacy and conservation. Founder and Director of Bee City USA and Bee Campus USA, Phyllis Stiles, will provide an overview of the Bee Campus USA program, including how it was started with the help of Southern Oregon University, the application process and commitments required for certification, and the accomplishments of certified Bee Campus USA institutions. Of the more than twenty institutions certified thus far, the initiative to become a leader in pollinator conservation has come variously from students, faculty, grounds staff, administrators, sustainability staff or college presidents. The presentation will offer time for participants to brainstorm on what their campuses might do to educate their student bodies and staff and the broader community about the ecosystem services pollinators provide and how each of us can take action to sustain them.",Bee City USA,8282,,,,,,,,,,,,,Grounds,Food & Dining,Coordination & Planning,,,"bees,pollinators",10/15/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Phyllis Stiles,Founder & Executive Director,Bee City USA,8282,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000_Stiles_2884.pdf,,,
Occupant Engagement Leads to Substantial Energy Savings for Plug Loads,"Plug loads, defined as devices plugged into the wall outlet, comprise about 33% of a commercial building's total energy expenditure. Existing management technologies have overlooked the effects of building occupants on plug load usage. This study presents the results of a deployment of a new plug load management technology by Keewi Inc. with active occupant engagement and automation technologies. 71 Electronic devices of 12 different equipment types belonging to 20 occupants working at offices of 3 recreation buildings at Stanford University were evaluated. For each device, a smart plug was used to 1) measure energy consumption (kWh) over time, and 2) turn off devices when not in use, leading to energy savings. The Keewi mobile application was used to enable participants to view their consumption, remotely control devices, set schedules, and engage in gamification strategies with points, rewards and competitions. The study included 27 days of baseline monitoring followed by 54 days of interventions, which resulted in savings of 21% in average daily consumption. The highest savings were observed for speakers, shared printers and TVs. High occupant satisfaction was recorded with an average score of 7.1 (scale of 0-10) for increased knowledge of and engagement in energy saving activities due to the use of the technology. Occupant engagement is an effective strategy for plug load management that results in significant energy savings and the development of good energy stewards.",Keewi Inc.,8283,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Energy,,,,"energy reduction,occupant engagement,plug load,energy management",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Hedi Razavi,,Keewi Inc.,8283,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Razavi_3008.pdf,,,
"New App Leverages Power of Rewards Currency, Smart Tech and Games to Drive Purposeful Engagement Among Students","Calls by the new U.S. President to roll back environmental, health and justice protections has left many students feeling insecure and concerned for their futures. Interestingly, a campus' overall commitment to sustainability correlates to students' heightened sense of community and purpose, and by turn confidence in their future employability. 3P Partners, a Certified B Corp. (d.b.a. PIPs or PIPs Rewards), is designing a student sustainability engagement app that will help students not only learn about sustainability, but reward them for engaging in sustainable activities. The platform leverages the power of a rewards currency (called 'Positive Impact Points' or PIPs), smart tools and games to track and reward daily life choices that deliver personal and planetary benefit. By using data intelligence (gathered via simple backend integrations with tracking apps and devices), and applying principals of behavioral psychology (from loss aversion and competition to teams and social norming), the PIPs app is able to turn positive impact behaviors into a fun, social game-like experience that rewards and reinforces engagement. The campus community helps decide what actions to reward - from carpooling, bike sharing and riding the bus, to volunteering, recycling or turning off cell phones during class - and how the reward points can be used - maybe for discounts at local shops or at select online stores or maybe for discounts on tickets to cultural events.",PIPs Rewards,8284,,,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,"behavior change,gamification,games,information technology",10/16/2017,AASHE,Poster,Eric Sanders,Chief Revenue Officer,PIPs Rewards,8284,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500_Sanders_2063.pdf,,,
Evalutation of TETFUND contributions for the management of universities for sustainable development in southeast Nigeria,"Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) was established as an Intervention Agency under the Education Tax Act No. 7 in 1993 as Education Trust Fund.

Sustainability Through the Eyes of Nature,"Important institutions and systems-including our governments, capitalist economies, food production systems, and urban designs-often seem to produce problematic political, economic, environmental, and social outcomes. In addition, many of these human-designed systems are showing signs of instability or imminent collapse, which can manifest as overwhelming debt, loss of public trust, erosion of vital resources, and social strife. In response to these problems, many people are attempting to reform these systems. But how can we know that our efforts to reform these very complex systems will produce the outcomes we desire, and how can we know if our reformed systems will be both functional and sustainable? One way to develop functional and sustainable human systems is to model them after non-human systems, such as those in nature. Ecosystems, natural communities, and the biosphere have demonstrated superior levels of dynamic functionality and sustainability. Studying natural systems provides us with an opportunity to reflect upon what more sustainable human systems might look like. Join as we view issues of interdependence, resource distribution, wealth accumulation, waste streaming, and group decision-making through the eyes of nature.","Atwell, LLC",8287,,,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Grounds,,,,"nature,natural environment",10/17/2017,AASHE,Presentation,Steve Thomas,"Ecologist, The Nature of Sustainability author","Atwell, LLC",8287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Thomas_2152.pdf,,,
Building Energy Performance in LEED 2009 vs. LEED v4,"As of November 2016, newly registered LEED projects must use LEED v4. One of the key changes between LEED v4 and LEED 2009 is that option 1 under the Optimize Energy Performance credit is based on ASHRAE 90.1-2010 (as compared to ASHRAE 90.1-2007 in LEED 2009). This change will impact the energy model process and resulting point achievement for projects pursing LEED certification. In this session, the energy model of a 27,000 square foot southeastern university classroom and office building will be used to demonstrate the impact of this change. The model is a whole building energy simulation comparing the design building to a code compliant baseline. A summary of the energy model will be provided for both ASHRAE versions to illustrate the difference between the Optimize Energy Performance credit in LEED 2009 and LEED v4. A simulation of the baseline model for both versions of ASHRAE was found to vary by over 18% in annual electricity use.
