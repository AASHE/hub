1.2 MW Solar Field,"The University became home to one of the largest solar power systems on a campus anywhere in the nation thanks to a partnership with BP Solar and Black Hills Energy (formerly Aquila). Dedicated on Jan. 13 in a ceremony with Governor Bill Ritter and newly appointed Senator Michael Bennet, the system sits on the east side of campus between the physical plant complex and the softball fields on a strip of land that could not easily serve any other purpose. Installation of the ground-based solar system began in the summer and became operational Dec. 19. This project will help control the University’s utility costs as prices and usage increase, promote the use of sustainable resources, help satisfy Black Hills Energy’s state mandates, and allow BP Solar to bring a major solar project to Southern Colorado. The three-acre, 1+ megawatt solar project will contribute more than 10 percent of the University’s electricity needs, equivalent to the amount needed to power 225 homes.

15 kW Rooftop Array: Ralph Rapson Hall,"On the roof of Ralph Rapson Hall, three 24-panel arrays of photovoltaic solar panels provide electricity to the building. The 15 kW system was formerly on the Science Museum in St. Paul and was moved and reinstalled at the University by Xcel Energy. A project is underway in which the energy from the PV collectors will be used to power an electrolyzer that separates water into hydrogen and oxygen.

OSU was the first to install and have operational solar arrays. The five arrays cover more than twelve acres combined. Three are in Corvallis two are at OSU properties elsewhere in the state. The five arrays produce around 3,286,780 kilowatt hours annually, combined. This provides between 3% and 4% of OSU's total combined electrical needs (for all facilities across the state).

25 kW WF-1 Wind Turbine,"In the mid 1970s a 25 kW wind turbine was designed, built and installed at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Known as the WF-1, it is historically one of the most significant wind turbines from that era. Although small by modern standards, at the time of its completion it was the largest operating wind turbine in the US and perhaps the largest operating turbine in the world.
In many ways, the WF-1 has heavily influenced the entire modern global wind industry: the first generation of American wind engineers were trained by working on its design and operation, and many of the WF-1’s innovations appear in modern turbines. Today’s “mature” wind turbine design bears what was once new on the WF-1: three blades, near-optimal blade-shape, fiberglass blades, pitch regulation, variable speed operation, and computer control.",University of Massachusetts Amherst,18951,,,,,,,,"renewable energy,wind",1/1/1975,25,,,Wind - Horizontal Axis,,,Unknown,,Unknown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.umass.edu/windenergy/about/history/windturbinewf1,,,,,Monika Urbanski,monika.urbanski@aashe.org,1/1/2012

600 kW Wind Turbine,"UMass Dartmouth broke ground on its wind turbine project, marking the latest milestone in its campus-wide effort to reduce annual energy costs by $3 million, shrink annual carbon emissions by 22 million pounds of carbon dioxide, and engage its students, faculty, and staff in sustainable practices. The wind turbine groundbreaking comes as the campus is completing the first phase of an energy systems modernization project and a major solar panel installation. The 600-kilowatt wind turbine will annually produce the same amount of energy as burning approximately 39 tons of coal. The turbine will eliminate the emission of 1,161 pounds of sulfur dioxide and 489 pounds of nitrous oxide; and reduce emission of 600,000 pounds (295 tons) of carbon dioxide annually.
