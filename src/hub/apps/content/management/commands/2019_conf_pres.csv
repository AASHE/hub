2099,Carbon Pricing on Campus IV: Networking Session for Institutions Advancing Carbon Pricing Solutions,"There are now nine higher education institutions in the U.S. that have implemented some form of an internal price on carbon, and many more exploring this strategy. Following up on last year's successful networking session, come learn the latest on how students, sustainability staff, faculty, and administrators are collaborating to advance carbon pricing at their schools and local communities, and how you can bring carbon pricing home to your school. Carbon pricing is a fair, effective, and powerful policy solution to accelerate the transition away from a fossil fuel-based economy. With a growing number of pricing policies around the world and increasing momentum in the US at the national level and in several states, higher education has an important role to play in educating our communities about, and building political will for, carbon pricing solutions. We will share how schools have instituted internal carbon pricing programs, directly endorsed federal and state pricing policies, and worked to educate our campuses and local communities. We will help connect attendees with key tools in the Toolkit for Carbon Pricing in Higher Education. This networking session is for administrators, faculty, staff, and students from institutions at any level of background or progress--for those who have implemented internal prices to those who are just learning about the topic.",Arizona State University,4531,Yale University,3678,Smith College,4705,Second Nature,0123,,,,,Air & Climate,Public Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,"carbon pricing,community engagement",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Mick Dalrymple,"Director, University Sustainability Practices",Arizona State University,4531,Casey Pickett,Director of the Carbon Charge,Yale University,3678,Alex Barron,Assistant Professor - ES&P,Smith College,4705,Ruby Woodside,Innovative Services Manager,Second Nature,0123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1645_Dalrymple_1564.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16797/1645_Dalrymple_1564.pdf,,,,,,
2296,"Carbon and Nitrogen 'Footprinting' 101: Tools for Sustainability Education, Advocacy, and Planning","It's well-established that calculating the campus carbon and nitrogen footprint provides important quantitative information to assess, track, and improve campus sustainability, yet the majority of colleges and universities across the US (and globe) haven't yet conducted either. Even for those campuses that have done so, there are many untapped opportunities for faculty members and students to be involved in this assessment exercise. For faculty in disciplines as diverse as math and statistics to policy to planning, from environmental science and sustainability to food systems and agriculture, from energy and economics to business and management, exploration of the campus carbon and/or nitrogen footprints can be a powerful pedagogical tool for applying theoretical concepts to real-world problems and tasks. For students, contributing to a campus footprint assessment can provide a credible platform from which to advocate for institutional change, and enhance knowledge of how complex organizations-like one's own campus-work. Knowing where to start and how to calculate a meaningful footprint can be challenging, but doing so can also encourage new lines of communication, insight and creativity on campus. In this session, we will introduce some basic GHG and Nitrogen accounting concepts, outline best practices for collecting relevant 'activity' data (i.e. data about campus activities that have greenhouse gas and nitrogen impacts), and introduce the web-based SIMAP (Sustainability Indicator Management and Analysis Platform) which is designed to support completion of carbon and nitrogen inventories and used by over more than 90% of the campuses that currently track their footprints. This session will feature a panel presentation of roughly 30 minutes, and then we will break into small groups for discussion, planning and problem-solving.",University of New Hampshire,0724,,,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,"carbon footprint,nitrogen footprint,nitrogen,SIMAP",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Jennifer Andrews,Project Director,University of New Hampshire,0724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2003,University of Californiac's RFI for Campus-initiated Offsets & the Offset Network Peer Verification,"The Offset Network is an online platform for colleges and universities considering the development of their own emission-reducing projects to fulfill carbon neutrality commitments. Self-generated offsets offer greater flexibility than market-based purchases to focus offset investments on projects that directly fulfill academic mission. Campus-initiated projects can expand and apply campus research, directly benefit nearby communities, and offer students applied educational opportunities such as through project co-design, involvement in project implementation and monitoring, and cross-campus peer verification. Self-generated offsets are impactful projects that have appealed to administrators, fulfilling climate goals while promoting community engagement and doing what colleges/universities do best - education, research, public service, and developing and testing climate solutions. The University of California system of ten campuses has embraced this approach to offsets with its system-wide release of a Request for Ideas (RFI) for University-initiated projects earlier this year. The RFI engages faculty, staff, students, and researchers in the conception and eventual design and implementation of carbon offset projects towards the system's 2025 Carbon Neutrality Initiative goal. This panel presentation will discuss UC's process of developing and releasing the RFI, reviewing submissions, and the RFI's outcomes. The panel will also give an overview of the OffsetNetwork.org's innovative and peer verification pathways that enable UC's self-generation approach. This panel will present perspectives from a UC campus, a researcher leading the RFI process, Offsets Network, and Second Nature.",Second Nature,0123,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,"University of California, Davis",4501,Duke University,1336,,,,,Air & Climate,Public Engagement,,,,,"carbon offsets,request for ideas (RFI)",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Ruby Woodside,Innovative Services Manager,Second Nature,0123,Barbara Haya,Research Fellow,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,Camille Kirk,Director of Sustainability and Campus Sustainability Planner,"University of California, Davis",4501,Matthew Arsenault,"Program Manager, Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative",Duke University,1336,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Kirk_1407.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16441/0915_Kirk_1407.pdf,,,,,,
2382,"Going Carbon Neutral - Giving Everyone a Voice, With Students Leading the Charge","Dr. Simon Pek and Dr. Rick Cotton will take you on Gustavson School of Business' journey to carbon neutrality. In sharing the story of this success their aim is to help others achieve the same goals: reduce our impact on the environment and teach students both by example and with opportunities for experiential learning. The session will cover the multi-step process the school employed to achieve carbon neutrality, from data collection to determine Gustavson's carbon emissions to implementing behaviour changes initiatives amongst faculty, staff and students. They will also walk participants through the crown jewel of the school's carbon neutrality strategy: our Carbon Offset Pitch Competition. Gustavson was eager to establish broad-based carbon neutrality because there has always been a strong desire by people at the School to be socially responsible and to operate sustainably. As educators for the next generation of business leaders Gustavson wanted to teach by example. The Carbon Offset Pitch Competition invites students to analyze carbon offset projects and make a portfolio recommendation to the School. Gustavson faculty, students and staff vote on the student portfolio entries, collectively determining how to achieve carbon neutrality. Dr. Pek and Dr. Cotton are excited to share Gustavson's experiences in the hopes that other institutions will take our carbon neutrality strategy and make it their own, ramping up the effects on the environment. They'd also like to collaborate with other Schools, helping them create their own competition or establishing other initiatives like behavioural change challenges. Filled with stories of successes and learnings along the way, Dr. Pek and Dr. Cotton will share suggestions for how to begin the journey to carbon neutrality at your institution.",University of Victoria,7860,,,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Campus Engagement,,"Business, Management, & Finance",,,"carbon neutrality,competitions,carbon offsets,students",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Simon Pek,"Assistant Professor, Gustavson School of Business",University of Victoria,7860,Rick Cotton,Associate Professor,University of Victoria,7860,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Cotton_1695.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17549/1100_Cotton_1695.pdf,1100_Cotton_1695_1119_124157.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17549/1100_Cotton_1695_1119_124157.pdf,,,,
2059,Proxy Carbon Pricing for Identifying Climate-Smart Investments: Lessons From Practice,"Given the slow policy response by governments, climate action in higher education has become an essential part of maintaining policy momentum, driving innovation, and fostering social dialog. Carbon pricing has been identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and others as a powerful tool to change behavior, shift investments, and fund climate action. Despite the growth in carbon pricing in government and rapid growth in internal carbon pricing in the private sector, internal carbon prices (ICPs) at colleges and universities have only recently started to take root. We will summarize the kinds of ICP policies in use in higher education and describe several reasons why proxy carbon prices may be especially well suited to many schools - sometimes in concert with other kinds of ICPs. Using a unique dataset covering 10 years of real-world analysis with a proxy price from 3 schools, we analyze the interaction of ICPs with life-cycle cost analysis and identify when and how internal carbon pricing will be most likely to shift decisions and use it to highlight advice for experimentation and implementation. We will also highlight proxy carbon pricing tools available on the Internal Carbon Pricing in Higher Education Toolkit website that can help your school take the next step.",Smith College,4705,Princeton University,2597,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,Investment & Finance,,,,"carbon pricing,digital tools",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Alex Barron,Assistant Professor - ES&P,Smith College,4705,Shana Weber,"Director, Office of Sustainability",Princeton University,2597,Dano Weisbord,Director of Sustainability and Campus Planning,Smith College,4705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Barron_1607.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16667/1445_Barron_1607.pdf,,,,,,
1949,What is Carbon Neutrality for? A Framework for Sustainability Leadership Beyond Offsets,"The most important number in climate policy is zero - we need to achieve carbon neutrality as quickly as possible to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Academic institutions have both the mission and the technical capacity to be leaders in the transition to a decarbonized society. Over 600 U.S. institutions have signed the American Association of University and College Presidents pledge to achieve carbon neutrality and a handful have already announced carbon neutrality. However, for most institutions, a lot of hard work remains. This presentation will discuss institutional commitments to carbon neutrality in the context of the broader climate policy ecosystem. Leveraging 8 years of Federal-level climate policy experience, we will discuss how a purely institutional focus on neutrality may limit the potential impact of higher education climate efforts. After a policy analysis of trajectories that existing schools have taken to carbon neutrality, we will present a draft framework for the highest leverage components of carbon neutrality, such as demonstrating and deploying technology, driving engagement, and conducting research. We will also discuss what the academic literature has to say about risks around offsets (and biomass) and how schools might take these risks into account when thinking about strategies.",Smith College,4705,Amherst College,2649,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Public Engagement,,,,,"carbon neutrality,climate policy,leadership,climate commitments",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Alex Barron,Assistant Professor - ES&P,Smith College,4705,Laura Draucker,Director of Sustainability,Amherst College,2649,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Barron_1642.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16256/1445_Barron_1642.pdf,,,,,,
2191,Why Colleges Should Consider Nitrogen: Lessons from the NFT Network,"The NFT (Nitrogen Footprint Tool) Network was formed in 2014 to develop a tool for institutions to evaluate the impact of their activities and consumption on reactive nitrogen released to the environment, which contributes to a cascade of local and global impacts. This session will review the benefits and motivations for calculating a campus nitrogen footprint and familiarize new users with the process of performing simultaneous campus carbon and nitrogen footprint assessments in SIMAP. There are several motivations for campuses to use the N footprint component of SIMAP: 1. The nitrogen footprint is a robust indicator of food sustainability that can be used to justify and track initiatives in that area; 2. The nitrogen footprint can be used to support resiliency efforts, such as those in Second Nature's Resilience Commitment; and 3. The nitrogen footprint can frame understandings of an institution's relation to both local and global environmental pollution, which means it can contribute to initiatives that improve local environmental quality. Drawing on the work of the NFT Network over the past five years, this session will provide examples of what can be learned from a campus nitrogen footprint as well as what actions can be taken to achieve a more sustainable footprint. The NFT requires collaborations across campus to gather data and develop strategies to move towards a more sustainable footprint, particularly with food and dining operations and campus greenhouse gas assessment projects. Several campuses in the NFT Network have made strides towards setting nitrogen reduction goals, and there are many opportunities for further research and collaboration within and between campuses to improve these efforts. This session will highlight the achievements of the NFT Network and discuss areas of opportunity for the nitrogen footprint to contribute to campus and local efforts around sustainability and resilience.","University of California, Davis",4501,University of New Hampshire,0724,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"nitrogen footprint,SIMAP",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Elizabeth Castner,"Graduate Student or Above, Graduate Student","University of California, Davis",4501,Jennifer Andrews,Project Director,University of New Hampshire,0724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1895,Not Your Grandma's CAP: An Interactive Climate Action Plan for Storytelling and Spurring Change,"Shouldn't a campus's climate action plan lead to actual 'actions'? One might say, of course! In reality, traditional climate actions plans become static reports that once done are least socialized/researched amongst campus community because static reports can only offer so much learning. The case study presented in this session walks the audience through the steps and tools used in development of University at Buffalo (UB)'s Integrated Collaborative Energy and Climate Action Plan (ICECAP). ICECAP was developed to update UB's existing climate action plan (CAP) from 2009. The project's inception was inspired by the need to have a tool to capture, visualize and present the story of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) on all three UB campuses. The project goals were; updating the campus GHG baseline, making the information accessible to campus community at large, increase data granularity, create a clear reduction pathway and establish accountability with verification. The final product became an online tool that users can interact with to understand where the largest sources of emission are, what the impact of each reduction strategy is and where the biggest bang for the buck on capital projects is. The online platform also allows students to directly access the data for research projects and engagement on sustainability-related courses.",CannonDesign,5761,,,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"climate action plans,digital tools,emissions reporting",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Amir Rezaei,Business Representative,CannonDesign,5761,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Rezaei_1272.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16122/0830_Rezaei_1272.pptx,,,,,,
2228,"Understanding Climate Motivators, Barriers, and Required Resources for Action","Post-secondary institutions are viewed as leaders in their communities; this includes action on climate change to ensure a prosperous future for their graduates filled with opportunities for success. Though high motivation for climate action is prevalent throughout higher education certain barriers exist that may prevent implementation of large-scale greenhouse gas reduction initiatives. The Campus Carbon Management Initiative (CCMI) is an Ontario initiative that works to support post-secondary climate action by providing resources that address described barriers. In its first year, the CCMI interviewed 21 colleges to understand the motivators, barriers, and resources required for emissions reduction progress. Resources are located in a free online toolkit that was released in March 2019. This session will cover the outreach process, identified motivators and barriers, as well as the supports described by colleges.",Mohawk College,6363,,,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Public Engagement,,,,,"motivation,barriers,climate action,inter-campus collaboration,digital tools",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Emily Vis,Project Lead,Mohawk College,6363,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1926,Welcome and Unwelcome Surprises on the Path to Carbon-Neutrality,"For many colleges and universities, the commitment to carbon-neutrality was initially a pledge based upon a leap of faith that was judged too important to delay until a clear path was understood. Now we have more than a decade of effort behind us which includes some pleasant surprises and some setbacks, and many lessons learned along the way. This presentation will take a candid look at what we have learned that will enable us to make course corrections and attain our commitment to carbon-neutrality. I will discuss the cost to reach carbon-neutrality; pathways that are more and less feasible than anticipated; strategies that may become viable if public policy, technology, and markets respond within our timeframe; and strategies that looked more promising at the outset then they do today. I will discuss some tough questions as well, such as whether emissions offsets are efficacious as an interim measure, a long term measure, or a stop-gap measure that will delay the kind of curve-bending progress needed by 2030; whether RECs are categorically more effective than emissions offsets; whether 'electrification' can be counted upon as the 'gold standard' pathway; whether purchasing renewables without equivalent storage is really a carbon-neutral action; and whether load-shifting, in itself, can be a carbon-neutral strategy in a grid with a deep 'duck curve.' As 2020 approaches, this is an appropriate time to pause and evaluate some tough questions, reflect on what we have learned, and possibly make some nuanced adjustments based on both lessons learned that will only be valuable if shared, and on emerging tools that may be fostered if we can support them with collective advocacy. This presentation will definitely not be a 'more of the same' message.","University of California, Irvine",4502,,,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"carbon neutrality,emissions reporting,climate commitments",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Wendell Brase,Associate Chancellor - Sustainability,"University of California, Irvine",4502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Brase_1477.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16204/1400_Brase_1477.pptx,,,,,,
2024,Strategic Electrification: Scenarios for How and Why Carbon Neutrality Depends on It,"More than 300 schools have pledged to achieve carbon neutrality at some point in the future through Second Nature's reporting platform. For nearly every school, carbon neutrality through means other than buying carbon offsets will require substantial investments and major changes to campus infrastructure. Meaningful solutions to climate change will require strategic management, interdisciplinary problem solving, and innovative technologies and policies. Given that, schools are tasked with creating and implementing long-term strategies to reimagine campus infrastructure to be carbon neutral. This relies on a four-prong strategy that every reasonable climate action plan is built on: reducing consumption, electrification, sourcing cleaner electricity, and buying or creating carbon offsets. These strategies are not unique, nor are they glamorous. Efforts toward demand reduction, electrification, and shifting electricity supply to renewable sources can be a complex game of chess, with each move affecting future moves, and many variables changing the stakes at each juncture. Financial and infrastructure constraints must be carefully managed, and a strategy for institutionalizing this work is critical for success. GreenerU has a recommended strategy for decarbonization is a four-step process: (1) invest in building energy efficiency; (2) transition to a carbon-neutral heating source; (3) transition to a carbon-neutral electricity source; and (4) purchase carbon offsets. Panelists will discuss the benefits, hurdles, and technologies associated with what steps campuses can take to begin the process of strategic electrification to achieve carbon neutrality. Investments in strategic electrification now can lead to substantial cost savings, as cheaper renewable technologies and advancements in battery technologies are improving our ability to switch to cleaner electricity on a larger scale, with substantial improvements in reliability.",GreenerU,5968,Amherst College,2649,Integral Group,7744,Carleton College,2821,Thompson Rivers University,1431,,,Air & Climate,Energy,,,,,"carbon neutrality,electrification",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,David Adamian,President and CEO,GreenerU,5968,Laura Draucker,Director of Sustainability,Amherst College,2649,David Kaneda,Principal,Integral Group,7744,Martha Larson,Manager of Campus Energy and Sustainability,Carleton College,2821,Jim Gudjonson,"Director, Sustainability Office",Thompson Rivers University,1431,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1947,Carbon Neutrality in a Cold Climate - A Portfolio Approach to GHG Emissions Reduction,"We will be highlighting our multi-faceted approach to hitting carbon neutrality reduction goals - Fuels, Efficiency, and Culture. Bates College has begun burning a new, wood-based liquid fuel in its central steam plant - the first college in the country to do so. This new fuel, called Renewable Fuel Oil, has an extremely low carbon lifecycle emissions profile. The fuel is cheaper than natural gas, and because it is a liquid fuel, is much easier to retrofit compared to other biomass-based solutions. It has been an integral part of the College's ability to make large strides towards our Carbon Neutrality pledge of 2020. The fuel, if popularized, has the additional potential to revitalize the US' struggling low-grade wood industry. We will share our process and lessons learned with the fuel, highlighting steps needed for schools interested in using this fuel.

2069,"Put A Price On It: Winning Strong Climate Policy on Campus, State and Federal Level","We are already experiencing the impacts of climate change, including increased temperatures, changes in rain and snowfall patterns, unprecedented droughts and heatwaves, stronger hurricanes, ocean acidification, sea level rise, and the spread of infectious diseases. Although these changes affect us all, the costs are disproportionately borne by future generations, communities of color, and low-income households that are ill-equipped to face the devastation of extreme weather, housing displacement, and financial distress. Putting a price on carbon pollution is a powerful and proven solution to climate change. By accounting for the true costs of carbon-based energy, there is an economic incentive to reduce emissions and invest in clean and renewable energy. A well-designed carbon price will help us reach ambitious climate goals while supporting a just transition from fossil fuels. As the generation with the most to lose when it comes to climate change, young people are the most effective spokespeople for climate action. Decision-makers respond to young people in a way they don't to other groups; so we are the perfect demographic to call for solutions that are fair, grounded in science, and proven to work. Our Climate trains and supports student leaders to effectively advocate for the policy by holding outreach events, securing influential endorsements, meeting with lawmakers, and engaging the media. Through our partnerships with national organizations, we amplify growing youth support for bold climate action through the media, celebrity endorsements, and creative actions.

2451,A Switch to Zero-Emission Buses for Campus Transportation Helps More Than the Riders!,"Many Universities are committed to 'Greening' their campuses. By simply replacing one diesel bus the CO2 emissions are reduced by approximately 230,000 lbs. annually. This means that one bus replacement can represent the GHG reduction of multiple LEED certified buildings. By committing to both efforts, your campus' sustainability goals can be realized, faster, more efficiently, and more visible. These ZERO EMISSION buses are rolling billboards to proudly display your campus 'Greening' efforts. A switch to zero-emission buses presents a critical opportunity to cut pollution, reduce oil dependence and create healthier campus communities. As just one example, the University of Montana's electric bus experience will be told by the transportation Director, Jordan Hess. ENVIRONMENTAL & COMMUNITY BENEFITS Particulate matter from traditional transit buses contains numerous harmful gases and upwards of 40 cancer-causing substances. We will help you take action for your universities and colleges to save on operating costs and meet environmental goals with zero-emission battery-electric buses that are clean, quiet and efficient. Replacing fossil fuel burning buses for any campus will not only benefit the air quality for everyone, inside and outside of the buses, but also save money from savings on fuel and maintenance. ECONOMIC BENEFITS 1) Over the lifetime of a bus, Proterra operational savings can reach $462,000 vs diesel - $242,000 in fuel savings vs. CNG - $275,000 in maintenance savings vs. diesel-hybrid 2) 30% fewer parts with no liquid fuel and no oil changes. Significantly reducing maintenance labor. Even with coal generated electricity - an electric bus is a 60% more efficient use of the energy produced, that a fossil fuel. Everyday we are moving towards more renewable energy, which means it will only improve with time.

The IPCC has identified carbon capture as an essential component to keeping the planet on track for meeting Paris Climate Agreement goals. Sustainability officers and a researcher from four large universities (U Maryland, U Minnesota, Michigan State U, and UCLA) will discuss four carbon capture technologies created by or being utilized by their universities to mitigate CO2 emissions from stationary sources. Projects that will be discussed include: U Maryland/HY-TEK Bio - Developing a profitable large scale carbon capture project using microalgae to consume CO2 and NOx emissions from the university's natural gas combined heat and power plant. U Minnesota/Clean O2 - In partnership with the natural gas utility, developing a carbon capture system for smaller facilities that uses a thermal chemical process to capture CO2 and create a feedstock for commercial and industrial use. Michigan State U/PHYCO2 - This research project is growing and testing strains of microalgae on the flue gases of MSU's power plant to determine which strain is most efficient at mitigating CO2 emissions. UCLA/CO2Concrete - This project is developing and field-testing a process that directly captures CO2 from power plant flue gases to produce a low-carbon replacement for concrete.","University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",0032,Michigan State University,0439,"University of California, Los Angeles",4167,,,,,,,Air & Climate,,,,,,"carbon sequestration,carbon capture,emissions reduction",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Shane Stennes,Director of Sustainability,"University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",0032,Ann Erhardt,Chief Sustainability Officer,Michigan State University,0439,Nurit Katz,Chief Sustainability Officer,"University of California, Los Angeles",4167,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Stennes_1314.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17864/1100_Stennes_1314.pdf,,,,,,

2438,Carbon Offsets 101: Campus Sustainability Initiatives,"Universities across the globe are committed to mitigating climate change impacts from campus activities. Solutions such as on-site solar, energy efficiency, recycling programs, or student-led environmental initiatives serve as a means to reducing campus emissions. However, with the onset of carbon neutral goals, universities are increasingly utilizing off-site greenhouse gas mitigation in the form of carbon offsets. The following poster session will provide insight into the rigorous process for generating a carbon offsets as well as its applications within the framework of university sustainability plans. Element Markets is a leading renewable natural gas marketing and environmental commodities company that applies its expertise in sustainability & carbon markets to provide structured services to prominent corporate and institutional clients.

2436,University Sustainability Initiatives: Utilizing Carbon Offsets to Achieve Sustainability Goals,"New initiatives by campus sustainability teams are increasingly focused on reducing their carbon footprint. Through initiatives like on-campus solar, energy efficiency projects, and recycling programs, universities are implementing new measures to bolster campus sustainability plans--oftentimes as part of a 2020 or 2025 goal. However, in large part due to vehicle and flight travel by administrators and faculty (scope 3 emissions), campuses are seeking off-site GHG mitigation measures to reach their sustainability goals. Carbon offsets provide a solution to mitigating emissions generated both on and off-campus and represent opportunities for universities to combat climate change.

2564,Defining the Finish Line: What a Circular Economy for Universities Should Look Like,"Over the last few decades, we recognized the dire threat of climate change and created an agreed upon understanding of the risks buildings pose to student learning, health and performance. We have green rating systems for the building, for the interiors, for the wellness of the occupants, and for the materials themselves. We even have a list of 17 Sustainable Development Goals establish by the United Nations for all countries to follow, and yet, the majority of buildings are still harmful to the environment and human health, and most campuses have no pathway to carbon neutrality, all while carbon levels keep increasing, now over 410 parts per million. In the next decade, more than 5,000 universities and colleges around the country will have to do something that has eluded humanity for 150 years: reduce their carbon emissions. But at our rate of urbanization, we're building the equivalent of a city the size of New York every five weeks, and student enrollment will hit an all-time high by 2030.

Architects not only have a responsibility to address issues of resource use and efficiencies, but we also have a responsibility to confront the culture of everyday life. This presentation will highlight a behavioral design approach to sustainability in which residence hall built landscapes are looked at as social constructs. This presentation examines three different design approaches to residence hall kitchens and connects specific types of student experiences with aspects of these different designs. Research has shown that much of human knowledge is gleaned through social participation in everyday activities and sustainable learning is no different. This study links various elements of residence hall kitchen design to the students' learning of sustainable behavior patterns and the growth of the residents' ecological awareness and identification.",University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,4059,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,Housing & Residence Life,,"building design,residence halls",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Sarah Keogh,PhD,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,4059,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1882,"How 'Green' Can Green Cleaning Get? Strategies for Policy, Procurement, and Practice","Waxie Sanitary Supply, the University of California, Irvine, and the University of California, Merced, are collaborating to build a more sustainable economy through green cleaning policies, procurement, and education. Implementing a green cleaning program can reduce exposure of building occupants and maintenance personnel to chemicals that may adversely impact human health and the environment, without increasing workload. That said, the path to green cleaning takes some skill in designing procurement, tracking, and training plans that work for stakeholders. We will share lessons learned, challenges, and successes. Waxie Sanitary Supply assists campuses in charting this path. They provide quality and innovative products, value-added services, and systems that contribute toward a better community through effective communication, education, and training. As one example of policy implementation, UC Merced's green cleaning policy has been in place since 2009. The campus has taken actions to reduce the environmental impact of maintaining the property while still providing a safe and healthy working environment for its occupants. These actions include all cleaning products, purchases and equipment which meet 100% sustainability criteria along with implemented sustainable cleaning strategies. As another case study, UCI Housing implemented a policy in 2018 and boasts over 82% of department spending for custodial products, specifically chemical and paper products, that are third-party certified to be safer, environmentally friendly, and/or include recycled content. UCI Housing staff will share about challenges in cleaning needs for residence halls and apartments. In each case, presenters can share how growing a campus culture around green cleaning requires technical knowledge and stakeholder engagement savvy. By decreasing pollution and exposure, these changes in procurement are an investment in the health of the planet and our workforce.","University of California, Irvine",4502,"University of California, Merced",2244,WAXIE Sanitary Supply,3415,,,,,,,Buildings,Purchasing,,,,,"green cleaning,policies",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Rachel Harvey,"Sustainability Program Manager, Student Housing","University of California, Irvine",4502,Mark Maxwell,Director of Sustainability,"University of California, Merced",2244,Keith Schneringer,Business Representative,WAXIE Sanitary Supply,3415,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Harvey_1217.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16081/0915_Harvey_1217.pdf,,,,,,
2547,How will FDD change the way we think about maintenance?,"It's easy to be tempted by new and shiny solutions - from cutting edge equipment to upgraded assets. But what if we're missing something - a solution that's humbler but ultimately more groundbreaking? What if we invested in maintaining the assets we already have? Fault Detection & Diagnostics (FDD) is our key to changing the narrative around maintenance, transforming it from a neglected task that evokes feelings of drudgery to a top-priority value-add for every organization. Facility teams across the globe are grappling with the demands of increasing responsibility and deteriorating assets, which are only exacerbated by decreasing access to resources and skilled labor. FDD is a solution capable of measuring, tracking, and improving performance across building portfolios, ultimately maintaining our current assets and saving thousands on energy and maintenance dollars without discarding old equipment for new alternatives. Join Sunny Sandhu, a building technology expert from CopperTree Analytics, to learn how to apply proactive practices to your daily workflow and change the way your organization thinks about maintenance, including: - how to apply FDD in your day-to-day - how to prioritize faults and take down low hanging fruit - how to communicate performance and needs internally",CopperTree Analytics,9037,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Coordination & Planning,,,Facilities Management,,fault detection & diagnostics,10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Sunny Sandhu,Business Development Manager,CopperTree Analytics,9037,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2076,Bentley University's LEED Platinum Ice Arena: A Business School's Teaching Tool,"Bentley University's new, state-of-the-art ice arena hosts the university's NCAA Division I hockey team. The Bentley Arena has been dubbed the most sustainable standalone ice arena in the nation, earning top honors from the USGBC with a LEED Platinum Certification, previously thought of as nearly impossible given the energy necessary to maintain an ice sheet. Critical to this designation is a unique heat reclamation loop powered by the building's ice plant, a 504K rooftop solar array and a high-efficiency smart lighting system. The building is now setting a new standard in sustainable design for ice arenas. This session will address two subject areas: 1. Explore the governance and design team processes necessary for sustainability officers to achieve success in sustainable design of capital projects. Amanda King, Executive Director of Bentley's Office of Sustainability will share best practices and engage the audience in discussing successful governance structures for navigating the sensitive politics often associated with bringing sustainable design to major campus capital projects. Amanda Lehman Garvey (Thornton Tomasetti) and Maria McMorran (Architectural Resources Cambridge) will provide insight into the design team's perspective. 2. Address the question of how higher education can best prepare students for success in a sustainable economy through teaching and research. As a business school that is committed to sustainability, Bentley University is in a unique position to use its LEED Platinum arena as a business case for sustainability. Since its completion in February 2018, the Bentley Arena has hosted 20 classes for five academic departments.

2068,Equity Drafting Table & Living Community Challenge: Tools for Engaging the Campus Community,"Higher Education Campuses have been leaders in the creation of Living Buildings. Now they are becoming leaders in the creation of Living Campuses. By optimizing lessons learned from the Living Building Challenge (LBC) and seeking holistic solutions beyond the building's footprint using the Living Community Challenge (LCC), colleges and universities are taking a holistic approach to regenerative design and planning and to achieving their organization's climate, resilience, and health commitments. A year ago, Williams College became a registered LCC project, and they are now using lessons learned as an early adopter of LBC to engage campus-wide. Now Williams is figuring out how to make LCC happen on the path to certification. One of the initial steps that Williams sustainability staff has focused on is equity, and they have sought to broaden the discussion of equity and access from individual buildings to the campus scale with their campus community. The tool that they started with is the International Living Future Institute's Equity Drafting Table (EDT). The EDT is part interactive pop-up and part art installation, an activity that fosters community conversations about equity in the built environment. Originally developed for community events, Williams customized the activity to the particular campus needs, and this past year ran the event on both campuses. The guiding questions included 'What will it take to make my community inclusive and robust for all?' and 'How do the planning, design, construction, and inhabiting of our built environment create more equitable spaces?' In this session, participants will learn about LCC, how to leverage lessons learned from the LBC building-scale, and get an in-depth look at how Williams College adapted ILFI's Equity Drafting Table (EDT) for higher education.

2534,"The Beneficial Intersections of Energy, Resilience, & Health","How can three important elements of sustainable buildings - energy efficiency, resiliency, and health and wellness - be integrated for better overall outcomes? How can the returns of sustainable building strategies with less quantifiable benefits - i.e. resiliency and health & wellness - be paired with more predictable returns of energy efficiency to calculate an overall return on investment? Where are we in the market in terms of sustainable building codes, and how much do we need to improve beyond code to get to high-performance, resilient, and wellness-oriented designs? We will tackle all these questions and more as we look at specific case studies where the elements of energy efficiency, resiliency, and health and wellness were integrated successfully. Three leading green building frameworks - LEED, WELL, and RELi which each have a role to play in this discussion - will be evaluated for overlaps and complementary strategies that lead to the high-performance, resilient, and wellness-oriented designs we are after. Topics like passive survivability, natural ventilation, zero net energy design, flood protection, occupant comfort thresholds, and more will help guide the technical underpinnings to this high-performance design discussion when energy, resilience, and health are incorporated holistically.","Stantec Consulting, Ltd.",0392,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Energy,Wellbeing & Work,,,,"energy efficiency,resilience,wellness,LEED,WELL Building Standard,human health,green buildings",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Blake Jackson,Sustainability Design Leader - US Northeast,"Stantec Consulting, Ltd.",0392,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Jackson_1431.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18404/1530_Jackson_1431.pdf,,,,,,
2001,Are Electric Buildings a Feasible Carbon Neutrality Strategy?,"The path to campus carbon neutrality is becoming clearer: electrify everything and procure renewable electricity. Electrifying campus energy infrastructure is a complex undertaking that requires a significant financial investment. While working toward that long-term goal, new buildings can be designed and built to run exclusively on electricity. For example, the University of California system's sustainability policy now prohibits using fossil fuels for space heating or hot water except in special circumstances. This session will present three electric building case studies from different campuses and different building types: labs, housing, and office. It will also share the perspective of an architect who has worked on multiple electric building projects and his interviews with mechanical engineers to assess any cost and technical challenges to designing and operating electric buildings. Finally, Stanford University has already made the investment to electrify energy infrastructure and will share its work to electrify the most challenging building equipment such as commercial kitchens and lab equipment.","University of California, Office of the President",4144,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,3324,"University of California, Irvine",4502,EHDD,9507,Stanford University,4127,,,Buildings,Energy,,,,,"energy efficiency,building design,electrification",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Matthew St.Clair,Director of Sustainability,"University of California, Office of the President",4144,John Elliott,Chief Sustainability Officer,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,3324,Richard Demerjian,Sustainability Staff,"University of California, Irvine",4502,scott shell,Principal,EHDD,9507,Fahmida Bangert,"Director, Sustainability and Business Services (former AASHE chair)",Stanford University,4127,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Bangert_1398.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17851/0915_Bangert_1398.pdf,0915_Elliott_1398.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16428/0915_Elliott_1398.pptx,0915_shell_1398.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16430/0915_shell_1398.pptx,0915_shell_1398_1120_102828.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16430/0915_shell_1398_1120_102828.pptx

2300,Design and Operational Consideration for Sustainable Maker Environments,"With the recent surge of interest surrounding the Maker Movement, many universities have allocated resources to developing their own maker spaces. The benefits of a maker education are vast, providing opportunities that stimulate creativity and develop problem-solving abilities for students. However, there is an inherent dichotomy between the maker and sustainability movements; the focus on production versus reduction. This session challenges how building design and operations need to shift to create lasting sustainable maker environments. Energy use in maker spaces is driven by equipment loads and operational timeframe. Most Universities allow for maker activity beyond standard class hours. This is a positive trend as it allows maximum use of the built environment. However, with this comes more energy use from equipment and the building infrastructure used to power and condition these spaces. To maximize the potential of the space and reduce the energy consumed while maintaining a safe environment, the maker space equipment, layout, adjacencies, and systems serving the equipment needs to be organized efficiently. Key design decisions include optimizing program and adjacencies; minimizing requirements for ventilation through shared programming; separating ventilation strategies from heating/cooling; and managing ventilation through demand control Maker ecosystems can include varying functions, from woodworking to rapid prototyping and electronics fabrication. The greatest asset to the student is to learn the process. However, the process creates waste. For instance, with rapid prototyping equipment becoming ubiquitous, there can be a significant addition to the waste stream. Practices like deconstruction can help. Deconstruction involves the elemental breakdown of a product to determine which parts can be recovered and/or reused. Maker Institutions need to understand the impact of each process and generate awareness of the products end-of-life impact.",Bohlin Cywinski Jackson,0960,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Energy,,,,,"building design,building systems,maker movement",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Patricia Culley,Senior Associate,Bohlin Cywinski Jackson,0960,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2305,Reducing Energy Costs and Improving Sustainability while Improving Indoor Air Quality,"The lowest hanging fruit for energy-saving initiatives has been lighting. Today, designers are looking for other places to find savings. Air filtration and IAQ offer huge opportunities for energy efficiency. Building occupants expect their indoor air to be free of contaminants which has led to higher efficiency filters, and in some instances, more ventilation air. Until recently, both approaches would normally increase costs. The biggest cost is not in the cost of the filter itself, but rather in the cost of the energy to push air through it. Energy represents over 90% of the cost of air filtration. Today there are air cleaning technologies with a much lower static pressure resistance that remove odors and VOCs in addition to ultrafine particles. Often, additional savings can be achieved using the IAQ Procedure of ASHRAE Standard 62 to reduce outdoor ventilation air requirements. Commercial buildings consume 40% of all energy in the U.S. Over half of that is used to condition and clean the air. And over half of that is fan energy. Clearly, that's some low hanging fruit. As a case in point we will examine the impact of air filtration systems on energy savings at the ASHRAE Headquarters.",Dynamic Air Quality Solutions,8695,,,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Energy,,,,,"indoor air quality,ventilation,energy reduction,energy efficiency",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Michael Farnsworth,Regional Manager,Dynamic Air Quality Solutions,8695,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Farnsworth_1798.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17339/1530_Farnsworth_1798.pdf,,,,,,
2011,How Sustainable & Integrated Design Supports the Vital Mission of the Knight Cancer Institute,"Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) is one of the only universities in the U.S. devoted exclusively to educating medical and public health professionals. The ambitious mission of their new Knight Cancer Research Building is to end cancer as we know it, but how can a building support such a challenging goal? Using an Integrated Project Delivery process and beginning with a clear set of OHSU's guiding principles for the project, the Research Building team delivered a facility with tailored strategies that provide real meaning for the building, which is anticipating LEED Platinum certification. OHSU's new Research Building is a key element in recruiting approximately 250 of the world's leading cancer researchers and physicians to lead the charge in curing cancer. To encourage innovative work, the building was designed to break down silos and promote the collaboration necessary to achieve medical breakthroughs. OHSU Ph.D. researcher Tiffani Howard acted as a liaison to the building team throughout the project to ensure an informed, collaborative and functional design. OHSU's guiding project principles helped clarify meaningful sustainability strategies for the facility: healthy materials and energy impacts. Many common building materials contain known carcinogens, but avoiding them is advanced and challenging work. For this cancer-fighting facility, the team prioritized a healthy indoor environment without finish materials that contain cancer-causing agents. Research institutions have notoriously high energy needs, but no leading building today can ignore its contributions to climate change. The completed design is estimated to use 35% less energy than a comparable facility, and a Whole Building Life Cycle Assessment reduced the carbon and environmental impacts of the building's materials as well.

2065,Introducing Fitwel: Practical Applications & Learning Opportunities to Advance Campus Wellness,"This session introduces Fitwel, a third-party health-focused rating system which utilizes evidence-based design approaches to promote positive health impacts across the built environment. Fitwel emerged at the same time as the WELL Building Standard, and rather than competing for market share with WELL, it seeks to provide an alternative at the other end of the market so as to provide a way in for projects of limited budget, scope and expertise to be able to reap the benefits of evidence-based approaches, suitable for new and existing buildings and interiors. Part 1 of this session explores the following about the standard: 1) what makes it similar to WELL and unique 2) how it interfaces with LEED 3) who is using it and why 4) how much it costs 5) what impacts has it accomplished in 3 years of being publicly available 6) how it is a useful tool for promoting health and wellness. Part 2 explores a case study where Fitwel was adapted for student learning that would eventually become a policy affecting all new buildings and retrofits at the University of Alberta, a community of over 45,000 in Edmonton. Fitwel started as the focus for a student-led graduate-level course whereby students performed gap analyses on various typical buildings types on campus. This learning turned into an adapted plan specific to UofA focused outcomes for promoting socialization and mental wellness. The main graduate student who ran the course will explain how lessons from the standard were adapted over multiple semesters, on multiple buildings, and was measured to prove the positive outcomes of implementing the evidence-based approaches. This informed everything from capital projects to furniture design - all informing a campus-wide wellness masterplan (UWell), clarifying how Fitwel can provide an opportunity for educational facilities to promote measurable outcomes through the utilization of evidence-based academic medical research in practice.","Stantec Consulting, Ltd.",0392,University of Alberta,2224,,,,,,,,,Buildings,Wellbeing & Work,Curriculum,,,,"wellness,Fitwel,WELL Building Standard,project based learning",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Blake Jackson,Sustainability Design Leader - US Northeast,"Stantec Consulting, Ltd.",0392,Erin Van Horn,Graduate Student,University of Alberta,2224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Jackson_1298.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16685/0830_Jackson_1298.pptx,,,,,,

What are the challenges and are there alternatives to better suit campus strategies around green building. As a networking session, the facilitators will create a sharing space to solicit feedback/discussion around what sustainability leaders within higher education are experiencing with green building platforms such as LEED v4, WELL, BREEAM, etc. Discussions will focus on the importance of sustainability, issues of climate change, reducing carbon emissions, the legacy of green buildings, and why sustainability is important to students. Attendees will walk away with learning ideas, successes, and failures from others and connections to keep the discussion going long after the session is over.",Michigan State University,0439,Catalyst Partners,9517,,,,,,,,,Buildings,,,,,,"building certifications,challenges,green buildings",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Ann Erhardt,Chief Sustainability Officer,Michigan State University,0439,Eric Doyle,Director of Business Development,Catalyst Partners,9517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1245_Erhardt_1871.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18199/1245_Erhardt_1871.pdf,,,,,,
2535,"Wildlife and the Built Environment - JCCC Bird Collision Study Data, Mitigation, and Results","Why do birds collide with windows? During the 2018 JCCC Bird Collision study we learned many of our buildings and elevated walkways have various issues that create hazards for birds. We will share how we set up a bird collision study, partnered with another institution to support their research, collected data by crowd sourcing from citizen scientists and student volunteers, collaborated with grounds, security and other departments to spot birds, and what the surprising results were in the data we collected but also in the diverse group of people on campus that participated in various aspects of the study. See how current research on the issue informed our decisions for mitigation, and what experimental test sites we set up to try and reduce costs. Learn how we got buy-in from administration, and secured funding to treat over 2000 sq. ft. of windows on campus in spring 2019.

2487,Convincing Our Colleagues to Fly Less: Engaging Academics on E-Conferencing,"Academic conferences provide invaluable scholarly interaction, yet a reliance on air travel means conferencing has a big carbon footprint. Estimates suggest air travel can make up 15-30 per cent of a post-secondary institution's emissions. For individuals, a couple flights a year can easily dwarf any other steps taken to reduce one's carbon footprint. For colleges and universities to take their climate pledges seriously, we need to develop carbon-neutral alternatives to traditional conferencing. From 2013-18, the University of Alberta hosted the Around the World Conference (ATW), a transcontinental research exchange without the air travel. This conference tests the feasibility of using online and video technologies to generate genuine scholarly exchanges. Each year, organizers experimented with formats and technologies, pushing the boundaries and building capacity on the university's IT team. In this poster presentation, I will share how my team is building off of ATW to promote e-conferencing to the university community. I will share our first steps at finding receptive faculty members-those who are willing to fly less and also take on the challenge of organizing a new type of conference. Surveys and focus groups have revealed differences between junior and senior scholars, differences in motivations, etc. while the Alberta Narratives Project provided valuable understanding of how messages on climate action can succeed or fail in our local context. While our goal is air travel reduction, this market research has revealed benefits, motivations and frames that might be more persuasive when it comes to convincing our colleagues to try e-conferencing.",University of Alberta,2224,,,,,,,,,,,Air & Climate,Public Engagement,Transportation,,,,"air travel,conferences,digital tools,emissions reduction",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Trevor Chow-Fraser,Program Lead (Marketing & Communications),University of Alberta,2224,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2549,Maximizing Campus Sustainability through Student/Staff-Driven Energy Efficiency and Engagement,"Learn about driving behavioral/engagement strategies to increase campus sustainability from two universities leveraging energy-saving programs to accomplish this. These campuses are utilizing social science-based behavioral principles to break down barriers and implement strategies and targeted activities that produce measurable results. Components of effective Engagement Campaigns will be reviewed including developing/deploying a Communications Plan and leveraging a Steering Committee/Green Team to create meaningful connections for students/staff that inspire action to improve campus facilities and culture. With just over 6,000 students, Colorado School of Mines (Mines) is an innovative, modern campus, fostering an entrepreneurial mindset, maintaining a sense of responsibility to promote positive change in the world through academic programs in engineering and applied science. Mines has sought energy benchmarking and efficiency across campus for over a decade now, recently on-boarding their first sustainability coordinator to lead all initiatives including STARS reporting. Tucked between Colorado's mountains and high plains, University of Northern Colorado (UNC) is a public doctoral research university committed to the success of its 13,000 students. UNC's student-led/funded grant program, Student Leadership for Environmental Action Fund oversees an annual budget of ~$190k and has funded sustainability projects including onsite solar. Both have partnered with McKinstry to implement powerED, a comprehensive efficiency program that enables institutions to achieve their goals in leadership, education, and optimization while saving energy and cutting waste. These individualized powerED programs will save each institution over $200k/yr in utility costs through low/no-cost behavioral strategies, significantly increasing campus-wide awareness/engagement.

2375,Sustainable Architecture and Initiatives: Lessons from Integrating Sustainability on Campus,"University campuses are living laboratories -- testing grounds for sustainability strategies that can translate to the larger communities within which the campuses reside. For communities of all sizes, integrated sustainability requires the involvement of multiple stakeholders and a flexible, multi-nodal plan that is part of both the physical and cultural environment. In this session, an architect and green building specialist experienced in higher education projects teams with sustainability staff from the University of Houston central campus and the University of Houston-Downtown to discuss the challenges and opportunities of integrating sustainability in campus environments. The presentation will explore the roles of green architecture, university processes, and academic curriculum as a means to integrate sustainable practices into both the physical environment and culture of universities. Among the examples discussed will be the value of showcase green buildings on campuses; student engagement efforts of UHD's Center for Urban Agriculture and Sustainability; and the data tracking, research, and policies supported by the University of Houston's Office of Sustainability. Through the sharing of lessons learned and brainstorming with the audience, this presentation will use campuses as case studies to help identify a diverse toolbox of both top-down and bottom-up strategies to integrate sustainability across university campuses and potentially within broader communities.",Kirksey,6376,University of Houston,2287,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Buildings,,Architecture,,,"green buildings,living labs",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Colley Hodges,Director of Sustainability,Kirksey,6376,Michael Mendoza,Sustainability Manager,University of Houston,2287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Mendoza_1652.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17525/1100_Mendoza_1652.pdf,,,,,,

2503,Creating and Maintaining Public Archives: Green Fund Website Redesign,"With help from our Student Union Marketing Team, The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) at UC Berkeley has entirely rebuilt its website on a new platform, creating a public archive of its projects and resources in a transition from using Joomla as a host site to WordPress. Our new website features 5 simple tabs including 'About Us,' 'Committee,' 'Funded Projects,' 'Resources,' and 'Apply for Funding,' each with a drop-down box of additional options. This is a much more streamlined version of our old website, as the old site had multiple drop down menus that made it challenging to navigate and keep current. In this collaborative session, come learn about some of the key aspects of TGIF's new website that make it user-friendly, informative, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. Attend also if you're curious what the process of website redesign requires, particularly for a program as robust as a 200+ project, $3 million program with 10 years of content and history. How can you use Google Drive as a tool to create a public archive that appropriately reflects your program, keeping in mind document security? How can you remain transparent while running a student fee funded program, while also balancing intellectual property rights and personal information? How can you balance design standards with functionality? What is a site map? How do you convert a site map to an actual site? How do you cut down content so that it's not too wordy? What are some useful WordPress tips and tricks? What is Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and how can you employ it in your program website? How is treating website visitors similar to serving customers, and how can we use Google Analytics to improve traction on the site? Join UC Berkeley's Student Union Digital Communications Manager and TGIF's Coordinator in exploring what makes a good program website, the challenges we faced on this 1.5-year long project, and the next steps we might take to assess the effectiveness of our site.","University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,Investment & Finance,,,,"communications,green funds,websites,Communications Track",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Teresa Yu,Staff,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,Kalelia Wilson,Digital Communications Manager,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Wilson_1158.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18256/0915_Wilson_1158.pptx,,,,,,
2131,Building From the Ground Up: Developing a Sustainable Campus From Scratch,"This session focuses on providing tips and tools for students and faculty who wish to develop a sustainability group or initiative, or grow one that is already initiated, at an institution that has not yet made sustainability a priority. The University of Central Oklahoma's Students For Sustainability organization was founded just 3 years ago with the goal of transforming the campus from one where people didn't know the word sustainability, to one where everyone was practicing sustainable habits. Although there was no sustainability precedent set on campus, or in the state, when the effort started, the organization has grown exponentially and has been able to impact many areas across campus; from helping student organizations host zero waste events, to hosting a Student Sustainability Summit. This session provides examples from the experience and offers new innovative ideas that can impact all campuses. A set of round table discussions is included that each focus on a specific topic that was found to be essential to growth, 'Developing Interpersonal Relationships in Your Organization', 'Seeking Administrative Support', 'Building Interorganizational Coalitions', and 'Involving Greek Life'. The goal of this session is to assist everyone and provide innovative ideas for overcoming local and global challenges, so that we may build a better and sustainable future for all.",University of Central Oklahoma,2052,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"student organizations,getting started,priorities",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Carlie Jennings,Department of Biology,University of Central Oklahoma,2052,Brooke Savoy,Undergraduate Student,University of Central Oklahoma,2052,Ryan Lykins,Students For Sustainability,University of Central Oklahoma,2052,Allie Williams,Student,University of Central Oklahoma,2052,Cody Yelton,Director of Student Outreach,University of Central Oklahoma,2052,Mary Bixler,Student,University of Central Oklahoma,2052,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2516,Mobilizing higher education to respond to the climate crisis - Part 1,"This special, experiential session is for faculty, staff, and students who are ready to call on higher education to face the realities of climate disruption and to prepare our communities for the massive ecosocial transitions that are already underway. We are tired of the old conversation about incremental change to marginally reduce negative impacts. This session invites participants to consider potential climate future scenarios and reflect on their roles & responsibilities to themselves, each other and our places in light of accelerating ecological breakdown and social unrest so that we might generate a vision of our futures that is hopeful, yet grounded by the latest scientific predictions about the climate crisis and its associated human suffering. We would like to lift up and strategically support the young people who are increasingly courageous in speaking up about the climate crisis, look to and learn from indigenous wisdom and elders, and build a network of those who are asking our institutions to take to heart what Greta Thunberg's call to: 1) Tell the truth about the climate emergency, and 2) Act accordingly (as Greta says, '...act as if the house is on fire - because it is.') We want more than one more signature on a piece of paper. We are ready for paradigm-shifting, systems transformation. We envision a leaderless movement that builds on successes, rapidly scales up ideas that work, and connects people at institutions to inspire the great transition away from fossil fuels and towards a new way of life. Attendance is limited by room size so we ask interested participants to pre-register (if space allows, there may be onsite registration, as well). Part 2 follows in the afternoon.

2358,Available for Download: Leveraging Generation Z's Impact on the Wellbeing Economy,"The goal of this presentation is to discuss the application of generational theory, specifically Generation Z, to principles of a wellbeing economy within a higher education setting. Generation Z students, born between 1995-2015, are becoming higher education's primary consumers, and data suggests that this group could provide sustainability professionals with a unique opportunity to merge awareness with meaningful activism. Drawing upon a review of relevant scholarly literature, as well as almost a decade of first-hand experiences coordinating co-curricular involvement activities for students, this presentation will provide attendees with the opportunity to learn how to facilitate meaningful educational moments for students to recognize, discuss, and act upon principles of a wellbeing economy; valuing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) strategy to move beyond Gross Domestic Product (GDP) indicators to create wellbeing indicators to guide decision making for economic policy. The presentation aims to leave attendees with practical action points for learning how to engage students in the process of creating and implementing programs that highlight the importance of a wellbeing economy.

1917,"Creating A Sustainability Magazine: A Diverse, Digital Experience","Everyone wants to find creative ways to tell their campus sustainability story. With so many different options, it can be challenging to identify the best route to take. Further complicating the matter for us as environmental organizations and sustainability champions, we also do not want to waste paper, even if that comes at the expense of getting the word out about our efforts. Since 2012, the Office of Sustainability at University of Maryland (UMD) has worked with the UMD Office of Strategic Communications to develop a biennial sustainability magazine, a print and digital publication. The project started out as a wishful mechanism for fundraising and to help further ingrain the sustainability culture at the university. A partnership with central communications began as a much-needed aid to help put together content and guide sustainability staff through the production process. Now after completing the fourth edition of the magazine in 2018, Andrew Muir shares his experience navigating and leading the project since joining the office in 2013. Andrew has successfully handled project manager responsibilities for three editions of the magazine (2014, 2016 & 2018) and will share lessons learned, tips and ideas for putting together your own sustainability magazine while also challenging the audience to think 'outside of the box' about whether it's worthwhile or not to publish a print publication that can also be shared digitally. The presentation will include an introduction that lays out how the project was conceived and its initial goals, how it has evolved over the last six years, and why other sustainability organizations should consider doing a similar project. An overarching theme of the presentation will include the benefits of working directly with your central communications staff on a similar project, how the publication can lead to additional outreach efforts, and the power of being able to physically give someone a piece of literature.","University of Maryland, College Park",1712,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,Communications & Marketing,,"communications,Communications Track",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Andrew Muir,Communications Manager,"University of Maryland, College Park",1712,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Muir_1408.ppt,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16180/0830_Muir_1408.ppt,,,,,,
2153,Building a Culture of Sustainability Through New Student Orientation,"This presentation will describe the process that we went through here at SUNY Oswego for First-Year Students. This process allowed us to educate new students on Sustainability and how it is important to bring sustainable practices into not only their lives, but also into the campus community. We did this by eliminating the use of plastic water bottles and replacing them with reusable bottles that are currently registered with the TapIn program. We then educated students on how to use the TapIn program by tabling during Orientation. We will also dive into the integration of sustainability at Lehigh University's first-year student orientation. Through a week of events, Lehigh's Office of Sustainability was present at 6 different orientation events, held 1 undergraduate info-session, and hosted a pre-orientation program called SustainabLEHIGH. Through participation in these events, Lehigh Sustainability attempted to help reach one of our Campus Sustainability Plan 2020 goals of giving all undergraduate, graduate, and transfer students an opportunity to participate in orientation activities and programming that includes sustainability and help foster a more sustainable community from the beginning of the academic year.

1941,Cultivating Student Leaders,"Using Bruce Tuckman's theory of team development, sustainability professionals from UC Berkeley will share their successes and challenges in creating a robust student centered program. This session will dive into the 4 key stages in team development: forming, storming, norming, and performing, facilitating a conversation around best practices in campus- wide student engagement. We use Tucker's framework to reflect and explore what it means to cultivate student leaders to empower them as critical changemakers on college campuses. UC Berkeley's Housing & Dining Sustainability Manager, The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) & Sustainability Initiatives Coordinator, and Student Environmental Resource Center (SERC) Director come together in this session to share their journey of team development and key insights into supporting students personally and professionally, including what it means to create a space of belonging, and navigating the role as a liaison between students and administration. How can you as an adviser and/or supervisor encourage progress without micromanaging? How can you employ effective delegation techniques while also being mindful of student leaders' busy schedules? How can you retain student staff through developing an inclusive and welcoming organizational culture and brand? What are some strategies for building trust and navigating 'hot topics?' How can you listen authentically to build up student voices on your campus and consequently emphasize student perspectives and experiences? Why is investing in team-building important for a group's success? How as an adviser/supervisor do you inspire self confidence, debunk imposter syndrome, and genuinely promote balance and self care? What role do students play in the co-creation of programs and services? How can you break down an 'us vs. them' mentality when it comes to career staff and student staff? We hope you will join us in exploring these important topics as a group.","University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,student leadership,10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Sharon Daraphonhdeth,"Director, Student Environmental Resource Center","University of California, Berkeley",4473,Samantha Lubow,Sustainability Coordinator,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Daraphonhdeth_1603.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16239/0830_Daraphonhdeth_1603.pdf,,,,,,
2151,Cutting Through the Noise: Developing a Comprehensive Communications Structure,"Many sustainability offices or green funds at large educational institutions are 'buried' within the organizations. One quick look at where sustainability lies on an institutional website gives a glimpse into the issue: sustainability is several clicks away from home pages. Because of this, intentional communication of sustainability events, goals and initiatives are key to gaining real estate within a university (whether on a website, in the news cycle, or for advertising initiatives or events). This panel discussion with presenters from the University of California at Berkeley, the Medical University of South Carolina, the University of Texas at Austin, and SUNY Geneseo will cover how each of their institutions have worked to increase visibility. Kristin Phillips (UT) will discuss strategic creation of interdisciplinary/inter-field stories/photos/video on social media and in newsletters to increase the visibility of sustainability on campus as well as media relations to increase story volume in campus publications. John Brooker (MUSC) will discuss how to use collaboration as a strategy to gain a larger audience for sustainability events and initiatives, how visual elements like report cards have increased composting/recycling, and how to drive event engagement to help build a sense of community. Teresa Yu and Elizabeth Reyes (UCB) will discuss soliciting grants; marketing around sensitive topics like environmental justice and diversity communications; programmatic branding through projects, social media, and annual reporting; building campus partners through collaboration, and diversity reporting. Dan DeZarn and Kris Dreessen will provide an overview of SUNY Geneseo's most important communications initiatives, how they share projects across media platforms to create an inter-supportive voice for their goals, and align with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. Previously, student, faculty, alumni and other Geneseo-affiliated groups worked independently, and communication was scattered and easily overlooked. Geneseo's communications structure includes an online news center dedicated to sustainability efforts, social media content, feature stories, videos and 'how to' content. Their unified approach to communicate sustainability initiatives and goals focuses on a unique storytelling map created using ArcGIS that demonstrates how Geneseo makes an impact, all over the world.",Medical University of South Carolina,3315,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,University of Texas at Austin,3049,State University of New York at Geneseo,1442,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"communications,marketing,goal setting,Communications Track",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,John Brooker,Sustainability Communications Specialist,Medical University of South Carolina,3315,Teresa Yu,Staff,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,Kristin Phillips,Communications and Events Coordinator,University of Texas at Austin,3049,Kris Dreessen,"Manager of Editorial Services, member of Geneseo's President's Commission on Sustainability",State University of New York at Geneseo,1442,Dan DeZarn,Director of Sustainability,State University of New York at Geneseo,1442,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Phillips.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17689/1400_Phillips.pptx,,,,,,
1984,Power of Partnerships: Sharing Successes and Lessons Learned,"In order to effectively reach the campus community, sustainability offices often strive to partner with other offices/departments to engage a broader audience in sustainability efforts. This typically leads to not only a larger audience, but a diverse audience that includes individuals who may not be interested in or motivated by typical sustainability office efforts. While collaborations can be fruitful, they can also be difficult to create and navigate. Five universities from North Carolina have come together to highlight some of their most beneficial and successful collaborations as well as discuss challenges. Partnerships include: Duke University In line with the University-wide Healthy Duke initiative to make Duke the healthiest campus in America, Sustainable Duke launched gratitude lunches with the Duke Wellness Office. Elon University The Office of Sustainability has collaborated with the Center for Race, Ethnicity, and Diversity Education to offer a mini-seminar focused on the health of communities of color in North Carolina. UNC Chapel Hill UNC's Three Zeros Environmental Initiative works with Carolina Dining Services (CDS) on an Eat.Sort.Win! campaign. This campaign had two parts: 1) a digital campaign designed to encourage engagement with CDS's social media channels; and 2) an outreach campaign in which student volunteers served as sortation concierges think twice about their waste. UNC Charlotte UNC Charlotte's Sustainability Office has partnered with various student organizations, Dining Services, and Leadership & Community Development to create Niner Hunger Relief.

2019,Getting to Yes on a Comprehensive Institutional Response to the Climate Crisis: Energy 2028,"Middlebury College trustees recently adopted a resolution committing the college to achieve the following goals: - Divestment from all fossil fuel and related investments in its endowment - 100% renewable energy sources for the main campus - 25% reduction in energy consumption - integration of these goals into the educational mission, curriculum, research and programs of the college Implementing these goals over the next ten years will bring significant opportunities and challenges along the way. A set of principles regarding how to do so responsibly is also part of the commitment, including how this can be done equitably and with positive net benefits at multiple levels (local, regional, global) economically, socially, and environmentally. Presenters will share the process by which this new focus on addressing the climate crisis came to be and the role of various stakeholders (students, staff, faculty, senior leadership and trustees) in bringing it together over the course of a year. It will also address the role of prior climate commitments, like carbon neutrality, in shaping the four-part package that was adopted, and how they are informing the implementation strategy going forward.

2340,Reinvigorating Your University's Sustainability Commitment,"While some universities have established sustainability offices, others may have a structure in place, but greater support is needed from faculty, students, and administrators. This presentation will describe the efforts at Southern New Hampshire University to relaunch a sustainability office. 13 years ago, SNHU signed the Second Nature climate agreement and was active in the renewable energy market. However, these efforts waned after the program director left. The purpose of this presentation is to describe key steps taken that can reinvigorate your college's efforts towards sustainability. After a two-year process, SNHU has recently recommitted to reducing our increasing our sustainability investment. Our story covers the co-creation of relaunched sustainability program by faculty, students, and administrators. Our case study will highlight the following points: 1) Students are vital co-creators of sustainability programs. Students are the most persuasive voice and are most directly impacted by the university's collective actions. 2) Faculty from across multiple disciplines can share resources and increase chance of approval. Similarly, combining requests or co-teaching courses across departments can help demonstrate broader interests and opportunities for research collaboration. 3) While formal funding is unlikely, identifying grants or spreading costs around multiple departments can provide small wins that get the attention of decision makers. Tying funding to specific goals and achievements can help focus fledgling sustainability actions. 4) Demonstrating the need for investment by comparing to other schools can create a virtuous cycle of improvements. Publicly available tools and programs add credibility to University decision makers. 5) There's strength in numbers when seeking to (re)launch new initiatives. Inviting each person who has provided input to join the team can increase chances of success by including a larger number of campus areas.

2215,Advancing Sustainability in Conservative Climates: Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches,"This panel will examine the approach to sustainability in higher education at two campuses, one public and one private, situated within challenging political and socio-economic contexts: Sul Ross State University, Alpine Texas and Wingate University, Wingate North Carolina. Discussion will center around two models of how sustainability is being 'done' within these challenging contexts. Dr. Gutierrez will showcase efforts at Sul Ross State University, part of the largest college system in Texas, to implement the Process of Change model to their grassroots Sustainability Council in 2018. This resulted in a strategic shift in their work patterns, more involvement by students, and more sustainability work taking place at different levels of the University, including strategic planning. Also in 2018, Wingate University, the fastest growing independent university in North Carolina, undertook the planning for an institute grounded in the principles of sustainability and innovation, and the outcome was the Collaborative for the Common Good (CCG). Dr. Wright is leading the CCG following her groundbreaking work with key university personnel to foster collaborative efforts between programs and departments that resulted in the procurement of a substantial planning grant and Green Revolving Loan Fund. Highlights from the work will include successful strategies for data collection and analysis and capacity building on and off campus.

2072,"""Greening with Lean"": Institutionalizing Sustainability Across Campus Through Lean Principles","Lean principles and techniques were designed to eliminate waste, discover avenues of improvement, and foster innovation. At Miami University, we have historically used Lean methods to increase revenue, improve productivity, reduce costs, increase cost avoidance, improve quality, improve customer satisfaction, and support and increase sustainability initiatives. The integration of sustainability as a breakthrough objective of our Lean program sought to institutionalize sustainability, as well as facilitate positive environmental impacts while also maintaining a sustainable economic structure for Miami University. Incorporating sustainability into our Lean program has encouraged faculty and staff across campus to appreciate the value of sustainability, engaged campus stakeholders in activities promoting sustainable practices, empowered individuals to advocate for the importance of sustainable practices, and given them the agency to find and apply sustainability components and practices in their work, between departments, and across campus. This session will walk through the design and structure of Miami University's Lean program by stressing how sustainability is integrated as a core goal. The presentation will cover how Miami University has empowered campus faculty and staff to submit Lean project ideas focused on sustainability, join Lean teams working on sustainability-related projects, and engage in Lean-related sustainability training. The presentation will also cover success stories of integrating sustainability within Lean through a discussion of the total number of sustainability Lean projects, monies saved through these projects, and case examples of said projects. Through this session, attendees will be exposed to one avenue for the institutionalization of sustainability across campus that stresses and values economic, environmental, and social sustainability.",Miami University,0357,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,lean thinking,10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Adam Sizemore,Director of Sustainability,Miami University,0357,Olivia Herron,Sustainability Coordinator,Miami University,0357,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Sizemore_1511.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16705/0830_Sizemore_1511.pdf,,,,,,
2381,Students and Staff: The Mutual Benefits of Connecting Student Groups and Sustainability Offices,"Student groups often are the driving force behind changes for sustainability on campus. Energized and empowered students can gain the attention of administrators and advocate for change which can be difficult to create from within the institution, as well as create programs that directly respond to student needs. However, there is often a steep learning curve for students as they determine how to create changes for sustainability or implement programs within an institutional framework. In addition, student groups are often dependent on a small group of passionate students, and when those students graduate or leave the university, it can be difficult for the group to maintain the same level of operation. At the University of Washington, the UW Sustainability Office provides administrative support and staff advisers to two independent student groups: the Campus Sustainability Fund (CSF) and UW EcoReps. These two groups are very different in size and scope, but both benefit from the institutional support by having access to institutional knowledge and consistency, along with staff who can help coordinate connections and meetings with administrators in order to advance student-driven sustainability efforts. UW Sustainability also benefits by having access to student ideas, determination and energy. CSF and EcoReps students provide ideas for projects and programs to advance sustainability across the university. In both cases, the student groups operate independently with student leadership, but UW Sustainability offers resources to the groups including the ability to use office space, help with IT and communication resources, and help with financial management; but the groups have an autonomous governance structure. This hybrid model allows the groups to access staff resources while maintaining student leadership. This session will outline how these connections have evolved over time, and present the perspectives of staff and students on the benefits of this model.","University of Washington, Seattle",4030,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,Sustainability Office,,"eco-reps,green funds,student organizations",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Daimon Eklund,Sustainability Communications Coordinator,"University of Washington, Seattle",4030,Kyle McDermott,Sustainability Staff,"University of Washington, Seattle",4030,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Eklund_1693.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17544/1100_Eklund_1693.pdf,,,,,,
2452,Sustainable Institutions and Campus Success Metrics: Useful Narratives for Appealing to Stakeholders,"The relationships between investment in campus sustainability and success metrics that are not typically associated with sustainability is poorly understood. We are interested in exploring the relationship between institutions with high Sustainability, Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS) ratings and other campus success metrics (e.g. endowment size, academic ranking). Higher Education Institution's rely on narrow economic and performance objective measures, measures that are important, but often overlooked, when justifying why campus resources should be allocated for the growth of sustainability action. Further, understanding these relationships is key in ensuring that all institutions, not just those with high success metrics, have the potential to attain a high STARS rating. We will present the results of our statistical analyses on the relationships between STARS-rated institutions and campus success metrics. We highlight the evidence based benefits of sustainability and provide narrative examples that demonstrate these relationships. These narratives are useful to those interested in increasing their institutional STARS rating, or growing their sustainability programs on campuses.",University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"metrics,performance indicators,STARS,ratings",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Benjamin Zacher,student,University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,Jake McCulloch,Sustainability Project Specialist,University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_McCulloch_1711.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18008/1400_McCulloch_1711.pptx,,,,,,

This presentation will focus on helping attendees understand and access these types of leaders and leadership structures within in their own organizations. Through strategic partnerships that were developed utilizing these theories, the presenter has accomplished a wide variety of sustainability initiatives, including but not limited to the development of a campus sustainability policy, energy efficiency projects, campus environmental audits, and a range of sustainability focused professional development programs for faculty and staff.",Chapman University,6041,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"leadership,staff engagement",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Mackenzie Crigger,Energy and Sustainability Manager,Chapman University,6041,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1937,Addressing the Challenge of Faculty/Staff Participation in Living Lab Campus Projects,"Living lab projects rightly focus on student participation. However, campuses are places where everyone - from members of the cleaning staff to the most seasoned faculty member - can learn and participate in new developments and innovative approaches to solving complex sustainability problems. To achieve this, it is critical to open multiple pathways for living lab project development and deployment so that faculty and staff can also participate. This presentation will focus on some of the challenges and opportunities in getting more faculty and staff ideas out of the labs and installed on campus. This includes developing the right mix of incentives and policies for faculty and research staff, as well as removing the obstacles to non-faculty staff participation. It will address some of the most burdensome barriers to overcome, such as changing the roles of facilities teams, approval processes, the uncertainty of standard processes, the acceptance of risks, questions regarding IP ownership, and dealing with privacy / regulatory ambiguity. This conversation will start with a brief description of the Sustainable Smart Campus as a Living Lab initiative at HKUST, supported by $50 million HKD in seed funding, to encourage faculty, operations and research staff, Entrepreneurship Center, and alumni to utilize the broader campus infrastructure as their living lab, and will continue with a deeper examination of the ongoing challenges that slow the development process. The presentation will benefit from an interactive discussion with panel members and audience sharing and exploring new ways of addressing faculty buy-in and participation. https://ssc.ust.hk/",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,7853,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,,,,"living labs,Campus as a Living Lab Track",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Davis Bookhart,Head of Sustainability,Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,7853,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2094,Medical Centers and Campus Sustainability: Best Practices and Developing a National Network,"Many institutions of higher education are associated with medical centers and schools. However, engaging hospitals on sustainability has several challenges. Hospitals face different regulatory environments, have different financial circumstances and budgets, and serve different stakeholders. This session aims to lay the groundwork for developing a community of sustainability professionals that interface with both universities and their associated medical centers. The majority of the session will be spent on introductions and getting to know each other. The remainder of the session will be dedicated to brainstorming a list of topics about shared challenges and opportunities that the group could collaborate on together. Potential topics include: How best to foster engagement on sustainability with medical centers, establishing sustainability goals, Practice Greenhealth versus AASHE STARS for reporting and data collection, and coordinating facilities around energy efficiency. Two additional outcomes from this networking session are to schedule quarterly calls and to collect contact information to create a mailing list to begin discussing the brainstormed list and best practices.","University of California, Office of the President",4144,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,Health Sciences & Medicine,,,"Practice Greenhealth,healthcare,medical centers,best practices",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Sapna Thottathil,Associate Director of Sustainability,"University of California, Office of the President",4144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2327,Moving Beyond 'You're the sustainability person' To A Culture of Sustainability Mindedness,"Sustainability professionals often hear the phrase 'you're the sustainability person'. This usually implies that the person making the statement does not care about sustainability as much. This particular mindset of 'it's not my problem' or 'I do not care about the effects of this decision on sustainability' can be damaging for an organization. This presentation will focus on ways of finding sustainability allies on campus and within the community. Included are methods that I have used to find like-minded people and how we are collectively working to create a culture of sustainability mindedness where everyone is a stakeholder. This session will be particularly beneficial for smaller campuses or campuses that have extremely limited resources for sustainability. Examples of how UW-River Falls, a campus with only .5 FTE dedicated to sustainability, has made connections and helped advance our sustainability efforts despite a lack of time and resources. Even with reductions in staffing and funding, UW-River Falls has progressed from a STARS Silver institution (for 6 consecutive years) to a STARS Gold institution. The session will focus on creating collaborations, using courses to help advance sustainability initiatives, and utilizing the STARS framework to make connections and benchmark progress. Session attendees will leave with ideas on how to get stakeholder engagement as well as how to form collaborations across campus and within the community. The goal of this session is to give attendees some tools for how they can help create cultures of sustainability mindedness within their organizations as opposed to being the only person who has an interest in being more sustainable.",University of Wisconsin-River Falls,0508,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,Sustainability Office,,"culture of sustainability,stakeholder engagement,on-campus collaboration,resource management",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Mark Klapatch-Mathias,Sustainability & Custodial Supervisor,University of Wisconsin-River Falls,0508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_KlapatchMathias_1317.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17397/1100_KlapatchMathias_1317.pdf,,,,,,
1907,Building Sustainability Student Leaders with Campus Collaborations,"Through a collaborative model, the University of Oregon nurtures environmental leadership in students. With scaffolded opportunities, students learn how to impact the culture, economy, and functioning of the 'mini city' that is a major research institution. The collaborations at UO occur across departments and units, bringing together facilities, student life, and academics. First, Dr. Sarah Stoeckl, program manager at the Office of Sustainability, will discuss the Environmental Leaders Academic Residential Community, focused on supporting first-year students with a shared passion for sustainability with opportunities to develop and enhance their skills. She will briefly overview the program's history, and discuss how it has changed to support burgeoning environmental leaders as well as best practices and lessons learned along the way. Then, Dr. Taylor McHolm, director of the Student Sustainability Center, will describe how the programs and opportunities on offer at the SSC deepen and enhance students' passions and abilities around sustainability. The SSC has placed a considered focus on social justice initiatives, including partnering with campus and community partners to lower the economic burden of college. 'Free Stores,' free farmer's markets, and access to resources like toilet paper and reusable containers serve a wide variety of students struggling with the cost of college. These programs not only serve students, they are staffed by them, giving students hands-on experience with environmental and social justice leadership. Last, both will discuss how their offices collaborate to support these students, enabling them to do more and support more students than each could do alone. The result is more engaged and better supported students who are gaining a holistic education preparing them to be leaders, contributors, and innovators in a complex world.",University of Oregon,3746,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,"student leadership,social justice,affordability",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Sarah Stoeckl,Program Manager,University of Oregon,3746,Taylor McHolm,"Program Director, Student Sustainability Center",University of Oregon,3746,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Stoeckl_1368.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16152/1400_Stoeckl_1368.pptx,,,,,,
2444,Role of Higher Education in the Transition to a Circular Economy,"The transition to a circular economy requires us to transform the way we create products, services and systems and this is necessarily dependent on how individuals, teams and organisations learn to innovate and apply those learnings in the real world. The higher education system therefore presents a natural opportunity to develop the insights, skills and mindsets needed to transition to a circular economy. This session will introduce the work of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, provide an overview of the topic, the schools of thought that have informed it, provide examples of the role Universities are playing and importantly share thinking on ways of working together going forward. The Foundation's work with higher education is now focusing on four areas of teaching, research, estate management and student-led initiatives. This session will explore these areas and engage participants to share their experience and challenges. Since establishing the Foundation's Higher Education Programme in 2012, the concept of a circular economy in universities has grown into a nascent field with rapidly increasing momentum. This can be observed in the higher education space in numerous ways: - Our recent landscape research shows that 138 institutions globally are now actively and explicitly teaching for a circular economy through their courses - The first ever international academic symposium dedicated to the Circular Economy (Exeter University) brought together 110 researchers from 17 different countries - Circa EUR 1.65 billion (2016- 2020) has been invested in research and innovation for a circular economy under the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme, meaning universities throughout Europe and in associated countries now have access to funds to research and innovate in this space - There is growing momentum in certain national circular economy research agendas with countries such as the UK, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands dedicating higher education research fund",Ellen MacArthur Foundation,9519,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,Research,,,,"research funding,circular economy",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Colin Webster,Learning Content Manager,Ellen MacArthur Foundation,9519,Reniera O'Donnell,Higher Education Lead,Ellen MacArthur Foundation,9519,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_ODonnell_1868.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17954/1445_ODonnell_1868.pdf,,,,,,
2145,Innovations in Peer to Peer Educator Programs,"Peer-to-peer educational programs have become one of the most effective means of increasing sustainability awareness on college campuses. While the names of these programs may vary, they all seek to utilize student social networks, which have traditionally been challenging for administrative offices to tap into. At Appalachian State, peer-to-peer educational programs have taken on many forms throughout the years. They have learned that proper organization, leadership opportunities, accountability, and ensuring valuable learning outcomes have proven to create the most efficient and wide-reaching peer-to peer-educational program the office has ever seen. At Colgate University, peer-to-peer educational programs have recently adopted a professional development component that distinguishes them from other leadership opportunities on campus. Specifically, the Sustainability Representatives (S-Reps) program allows first-year students to serve as liaisons between the Office of Sustainability and Residential Life to improve green living within their residential communities. Mentored by interns in the office, S-Reps are encouraged to leverage their training in sustainability as a platform for leadership and professional development both on- and off-campus, ultimately promoting a professional environment in which to learn, work, and grow.

2318,Interpretive Signage: Inspiring Students and Visitors with Your Living Lab Campus,"Colleges and universities are hotbeds of innovation in sustainability and wellness. Interpretive signage makes it possible for students and the community to engage with the Living Lab of the college campus. Visiting campus becomes an interactive process, providing opportunities to pursue sustainable solutions, wellness experiences and various career opportunities. Presenters will explore how the College of Lake County and Loyola University in Chicago developed interpretive signage to guide students and visitors along a path toward sustainability and a greater sense of well-being. The College of Lake County will share its collaborative process of developing its Living Lab Trail, with the Sustainability and Health and Wellness Promotion programs and the assistance of Quercus Consulting. Loyola University will share its experiences with conducting a sustainable landscape signage and outreach program. Both campuses use interpretive signage to feature geothermal heating and cooling, rain gardens, local food production, recycling and composting, and more.

1993,Educational Terroir: The Power of Place in Program Development,"The Dartmouth Sustainability Office has continually worked to pursue sustainability solutions that build upon the unique strengths and opportunities of our setting. Our programs increasingly draw upon the unique cultural & natural history of New Hampshire-- Our regional tradition of maple sugaring, our forested landscape, our rural agrarian foodshed, and the appreciation for self-sufficiency that springs from a cold rural landscape. The idea that our approach to education is influenced by the very landscape we teach in is what our office has started to refer to as 'educational terroir,' inspired by the term used by winemakers to describe the flavor qualities in wine that reflect the soil, farming practices, and environmental conditions in which the grapes are grown. Educational terroir is a concept that we are now starting to intentionally bring into our program development. By rooting our programs deeply in a sense of place, our students learn the importance of place-based solutions in creating lasting change. Localized solutions that grow from the context and needs of a specific community, informed by culture, landscape, and natural history-- These are the solutions that will be the drivers of change in creating a sustainable economy. In this session, we will explore the concept of educational terroir and how it can be used to amplify the impact of experiential learning programs and to generate tangible sustainability progress in your local communities. Participants will engage in active discussion to identify your educational terroir and apply these ideas at your school in ways that advance your institution's sustainability goals and core educational mission.",Dartmouth College,0788,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,,Sustainability Office,,"sense of place,experiential learning",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Laura Braasch,Program Manager,Dartmouth College,0788,Rosi Kerr,Sustainability Director,Dartmouth College,0788,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2091,Sustainable Living Student Communities,"Does your institution have a dedicated sustainable living student community in which students live together and strive to live more sustainable lifestyles? What curricular and co-curricular programming is offered as part of your program? Who oversees, manages, and supports the community? How is the program funded? For this session, we invite institutions that have a sustainable living student community to join us to share collective experiences, successes, challenges, and failures in the evolution of sustainable living campus communities. We hope to use the session to assemble and develop a shared support network for institutions with and organizers of such communities. We will start the session by sharing our experience with our community, the Greenbelt, now in its tenth year, and then facilitate an interactive discussion and information gathering with attendees regarding their programs. The Greenbelt community at Furman University is an intentional living-learning community intended to foster sustainable living and lifestyle choices among twenty-two upper-class student residents who live among four cabins along Furman's campus lake. The cabins are equipped with a variety of sustainable design features like solar thermal panels, solar tubes, clotheslines, composting buckets, locally sourced building materials, and smart home technology with real-time energy monitoring. Students in the community enroll in a one credit class each semester that meets on Friday afternoons. The fall class 'Sustainability Living and Leadership' focuses on having students take an in depth and reflective look at their own lifestyles and its impacts and encourages students to experiment with more sustainable lifestyle choices. In the spring course 'Making Change Happen' students use their training and experience from the fall course to identify and tackle a campus sustainability issue of their choosing and work in teams to find and implement solutions.",Furman University,3836,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,,,,"residence halls,sustainable living,student ambassadors",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Weston Dripps,Executive Director,Furman University,3836,Hannah Dailey,Program Coordinator,Furman University,3836,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1245_Dripps_1444.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16771/1245_Dripps_1444.pdf,,,,,,
1913,The Collaboratory: Engaging Students to Solve Authentic Problems and Create Tangible Solutions,"The Collaboratory at Los Angeles Pierce College is an interdisciplinary hub where faculty, students and community stakeholders work together to develop tangible solutions to authentic problems. Environmental sustainability is the core driver of these multi-discipline projects which engage students through both curriculum and extracurricular opportunities. The result is greater student exposure to environmental concepts such as sustainability, climate change and resiliency, strong curricular understanding, development of soft skills such as teamwork and collaboration and the completion of important and meaningful work. Collaboratory students have worked on projects including: Composting system designs, working with Burbank Recycle Center and LA Compost. Developing residential rainwater capture systems, landscape designs and drawings with TreePeople, a non-profit tree advocacy organization in Los Angeles. Creating visualizations of capital improvements for fundraising for OneGeneration a senior and infant care non-profit in Los Angeles. Designing systems to assist our student-run campus food pantry with mobile collection and distribution. Creating a campus food garden to provide fresh produce to our food insecure students with the Pierce Brahma Food Pantry. The educational benefits of this model include impact on student engagement and student retention, particularly for women and underserved communities. Simultaneously these projects increase human and social capital for local communities and for the college. The resulting projects improve the lives of stakeholders. We will share the Collaboratory model, how-to guide and highlight the benefits to students, faculty, and the community.

The implementation of sustainability in UCF SG and campus administration is achieved through two collaborative partnerships between UCF SI and the campus community: A member of the Executive Cabinet of UCF SG is appointed to serve as the Campus Innovation Coordinator to advance initiatives that improve the sustainability, health and wellness, and research scholarship of the UCF community. Concurrently, UCF SI is developing a program to integrate sustainability across UCF's curriculum through faculty-led committees from each academic college. This initiative is integrated with UCF's overhaul of its general education curriculum. As one of the largest universities by enrollment in the country, a study of sustainability in campus student government and administration is relevant and informative to a wide array of institutions, as projects at UCF are very sensitive to issues of scale and cross-institutional collaboration. An emphasis is placed on outcomes of innovative, transdisciplinary curriculum, community projects, and programming that engages stakeholders and emphasizes the ties between the environmental, psycho-social, and physical health of the campus community.

2234,"How Residential Curriculum Can Help You Reach More Students, Faster","First implemented in early 2000 as a curricular approach to the residential experience on college campuses, Residential Curriculum has swept across the US and changed the way many branches of Housing and Residence Life manage their first-year student experience. Residential Curriculum utilizes year by year outcomes and rubrics to create a focused, holistic curriculum that promotes community and global identity development while providing a consistent structure for the creation of campus-wide engagement strategies. This structure, as well as the focus on campus partners inherent in the model, affords sustainability professionals with a fantastic opportunity to reach more of their campus population by creating strategies that utilize residence life student and professional staff in the implementation. Has your campus shifted toward Residential Curriculum, or is your Residence Life team discussing the potential of a curricular model? Learn the basics of Residential Curriculum, and how your office can utilize this new model to improve your relationship with Residence Life while enhancing the effectiveness of the program's you offer on campus. Not moving toward Residential Curriculum? Learn how the language and process it offers can help you streamline your outreach efforts, assist with student staff development, and connect with Residence Life through shared vocabulary and values. Since the implementation of Residential Curriculum at CU Boulder, all 7,100 students living in the halls are exposed to sustainability-related programming throughout the year specifically designed to encourage dialogue around sustainability as a campus value. These programs have increased buy-in from residence life around sustainability as a value, help promote efforts from our other sustainability staff, provide additional education about waste on campus, and encourage the development of sustainable practices that students will carry with them throughout their lives.

1890,Avoiding Attitude Polarization in Conversations on Campus,"One of the largest opportunities in the sustainability movement is the access to growing minds in our student populations. Therefore, sustainability offices and partners constantly create opportunities on campuses and in communities to discuss issues surrounding sustainability. If our goal is to move students toward sustainability, we must be cognizant of how the adverse effect can occur. Utilizing psychological principles, this presentation will address how biased assimilation and attitude polarization can be an underlying influence in student discourse. We will all discuss ways in which our campus and community outreach and discussions have or have not accounted for these concepts, and what that ultimately resulted in for the students' attitude toward sustainability and/or climate change. At Indiana State University we have created opportunities to educate and engage the campus community in sustainability conversations. Through intentional tabling and dialogue-centered events, we have opened the possibility of confronting opinions or thoughts shared. Therefore, it has been important to keep biased assimilation and attitude polarization in mind while engaging these students.",Indiana State University,6353,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,"communications,student attitudes,Communications Track",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Garrett Hurley,Sustainability Graduate Assistant,Indiana State University,6353,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2483,A Novel Approach to Green Office Certification: Prioritizing Accessibility as Key Component,"The Office of Sustainability (OoS) at the College of Charleston (CofC) in South Carolina is launching the Green Office Certification Program in Fall 2019 after a one-year collaborative development period. CofC's Green Office (GO) is a multifaceted and incentivized program designed to promote sustainable practices beyond conventional GO zero waste and energy conservation constructs by elevating accessibility and thereby social inclusion as equally important criteria. Key stakeholders were consulted to launch the Program, including the Center for Disability Services, Office of Equal Opportunity Program, Facilities Management, and Sustainability Literacy Institute. While this Program functions like others to reduce CofC's environmental impact, it differs with its emphasis on social inclusion through physical and technological accessibility. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards have yet to be fully implemented at most college campuses, including CofC. This unprecedented approach to GO links accessibility and sustainability with direct action. Such a novel solution framework supports inclusive designs necessary for institutions to contribute to a sustainable economy. The need for prioritizing social cohesion at this 250-year old college is punctuated by the City of Charleston's exclusive history. Offices are certified through a point-based system with six areas of assessment. The assessment criteria align with the UN SDGs, specifically those that aim for innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequalities, strong institutions, and partnerships. The assessment tools will be completed through OoS's newly developed Sustainability App to manage data. Preliminary data will be collected and evaluated for the full rollout in Spring 2020. This novel approach to designing and implementing GO Programs has the potential to inspire Faculty, Staff and Students to implement feasible and more holistic standards for environmental performance and social inclusion.",College of Charleston,5047,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,,,Sustainability Office,,"green office,disability access,inclusion,office certifications",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Darien Parker,Student,College of Charleston,5047,Ashley Lynn Lavender,"Associate Director, Internship Coordinator, & Faculty",College of Charleston,5047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Parker_1890.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18179/1530_Parker_1890.pdf,,,,,,
2541,Award Winner Session: Cultivating Environmental Education for Students of Color,"The Students of Color Environmental Conference is the first ever conference for students of color that was also created and run by students of color. When traditional environmental spaces are dominated by a white centered narrative, it is often challenging for students of color to find belonging in such spaces. This is compounded by the fact that people of color are more likely to experience the impacts of climate change yet are not represented in the discussions and classrooms attempting to solve these issues. Giving students of color the resources to create inclusive spaces for them to gather and learn about environmental issues is critical to creating a more equitable environmental movement. There were multiple support systems in place that helped us create the conference, including funding from The Green Initiative Fund and staff support from the Student Environmental Resource Center. Some roadblocks included the costs of event space rentals, campus bureaucracy, and ensuring we did not over or underestimate the amount of attendees when determining resource allocation. The conference was very successful in providing nearly 200 students free access to a conference of 6 speakers, 21 workshops, 3 meals and free travel and housing accommodations. Attendees included college students from across California and even as far as New York. This conference demonstrated the power of organizing when students of color are given the resources and institutional support to create spaces that shift traditional narratives and empower one another to take up space in the modern environmental movement.","University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,Public Engagement,,,,"inclusion,environmental justice,racial & ethnic diversity,conferences",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Neena Mohan,Undergraduate Student,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,Zahira Chaudhry,Students of Color Environmental Collective,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1130_Mohan_1925.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18432/1130_Mohan_1925.pdf,,,,,,

These important components are combined into one document called the Gonzaga Renewable Energy Road Map which will be presented to our university to encourage commitment to renewable energy. To illustrate our process of initiating renewable energy on our campus, we will provide a template that students, faculty, and staff could use to create their own roadmap. This could also aid groups who are already involved with installing and investing in renewable energy resources at their university. Gonzaga Renewable Investment Group (GRIG), a committee of Gonzaga Environmental Organization, is a student group aspiring to install renewable energy sources on Gonzaga University's campus. We also focus on finding community partnerships to increase Gonzaga's use of renewable energy options.

2336,Empowering Energy and Resource Conservation in University Faculty and Staff,"This presentation is an informative and engaging seminar on two of Northern Arizona University's (NAU) Conservation Programs, The Green Office Certification Program (GOC), and Energy Mentor Program (EM). These conservation programs engage faculty and staff in the universities culture of sustainability through strategic education, relationship building, empowerment, and recognition. Our unique community, inclusivity, and connection based approach provide a platform for organic involvement and social change. We are excited to have the opportunity to share our stories with and brainstorm ways to improve the programs with other sustainability leaders in higher education. Our Green Office Certification Program plays a crucial role in the campus' culture of sustainability by means of education and recognition. The program's goal is to inform offices from all departments on campus on ways that they can conserve energy and resources in their everyday operations. The certification process looks at sustainable behaviors in several categories including energy conservation, recycling, waste reduction, events/meetings, purchasing, and campus engagement. We recognize achievement through completion of up to four levels which outline specific behaviors that increasingly lower the office's impact and are therefore require more effort and consciousness to carry out. In order to move beyond the second level of GOC, at least one member of the office must come certified as an Energy Mentor. The Energy Mentor program aims to educate campus faculty in staff on basic conservation behaviors so that they are comfortable acting as sustainability liaisons and mentors for their colleagues. Many of NAUs faculty and staff go above and beyond in the office setting every day by starting and spreading their own sustainability initiatives in order to be recognized at the platinum level.

The new structure of the energy challenge involved increased individual student participation. The energy challenge involves 5 events: ) Plant your own garden. 2) Water your own seeds. 3) Candlelit full moon yoga. 4) Make your own tea. 5) Open mic nights. At glance, all events seem conventional, but they are designed to focus on behavioral change by committing students to sustainable practices. The events run concurrently with a social media campaign that promotes the events, sustainability and participation. The events create an outreach targeted at creating sustainability awareness for students in a relaxed environment. Students are required to fill pre and post surveys which create opportunity for accountability, encourage commitment and provide data to measure the impact of the events. This has impacted on the students and led to increased awareness on sustainable practices beyond the dorm and college life.",University of Denver,2186,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Energy,,,Sustainability Office,,"competitions,outreach campaigns,energy reduction,behavior change",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Grace Houser,"Undergraduate Energy Lead, Center for Sustainability",University of Denver,2186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This poster will focus on Students for Sustainability's (S4S) aquaponics system and how it is being integrated into the surrounding community to help combat food insecurity. A PSU organization, Students for Sustainability, began developing an aquaponics system on the rooftop greenhouse located on campus in fall of 2018. Upon successful production of fish and produce yields, the students in the organization--in collaboration with another student group, Enactus--have begun expanding into the community through a collaborative project with one of the surrounding Unified School Districts (USD 246) most-impacted by low income levels and food insecurity. This extended project is intended to create access to fresh, local food primarily for the youth population within the school district, as well as educate the local youth base in sustainable food production and food systems through curriculum development surrounding the aquaponics operation installed on their campus.",Pittsburg State University,1234,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Food & Dining,Wellbeing & Work,,,,"aquaponics,greenhouses,food security,student organizations",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Erin Kruse,Student Sustainability Assistant,Pittsburg State University,1234,Charlie Beetch,Student,Pittsburg State University,1234,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2432,A Model for Higher Education Involvement in Land Conservation: The ALPINE Network,"With their academic roots, the authors of the Wildlands and Woodlands vision recognized that an untapped source of energy, skill, and commitment for land protection lies with the constituents of academic institutions in New England: students, faculty and staff, administration, and alumni. The network's common belief is that academic communities have both the potential and the moral obligation to be a powerful force for positive environmental change locally and globally. The ALPINE network seeks to explore and expand the role that academic institutions can play in conserving the New England landscape by bringing together representatives from colleges and universities to share their experiences and resources. Land conservation benefits academic communities in a variety of ways including water quality, health, carbon offsets etc. The network has currently 50 institutions including all of the main campuses of the six state universities, many small private colleges, community colleges, rural institutions with great land holdings, and urban institutions in densely populated areas. ALPINE aims to share success stories and lessons learned in order to increase the protection of institutional lands and those of surrounding communities, engage more of each institution's alumni in land-protection activities, and expand the regions targeted by conservation organizations and agencies. Initial activities guided by the ALPINE steering committee include developing case studies of institutional land-protection activities; mapping the land base of New England academic institutions; forging a strong collaboration with the Regional Conservation Partnership Network on landscape-scale initiatives, including the Appalachian Trail corridor and the Connecticut River Watershed, sharing curricula on the theory and practice of land protection; providing opportunities for students to do research/work in the field, and offering a variety of resources for undergraduate and graduate students.

1897,PIPs: Turning Student Engagement in Health and Sustainability Into Grants for School,"Imagine students being able to pay school expenses with a 'currency of good' - Positive Impact Points or PIPs - that they earned for verifiable engagement in beneficial behaviors such as riding the bus, biking, recycling, taking a fitness class, completing a mindfulness module and volunteering. And what if every dollar students directed toward such school-related expenses unlocked matching funds from a charitable foundation? All of this is now possible with PIPs for School, a new program made possible through the PIPs Rewards motivation & engagement app working in tandem with the PIPs Education Fund. As little as $1,000 in debt can force a student to drop out of school. This impacts not just the student (a cohort of entering students who drop out can lose $3.8 Billion in lifetime income) but their college or university, which stand to lose an average of $13 Million annually due to attrition. Aiming to help bridge the education equity gap, PIPs Rewards, a digital impact platform owned/operated by 3P Partners, Inc., a Certified B Corp, first motivates measurable engagement in valued behaviors that contribute to personal and planetary wellness, then reinforces those behaviors with rewards that themselves deliver material social and economic benefit to both students and schools. Presenters will showcase the PIPs app, the new PIPs for School program, its initial rollout at CU Boulder, plus a case study on early adopters. A powerful new tool for paying school expenses, one that values and rewards engagement in good, PIPs for School is especially attractive to universities, colleges and community colleges looking for cost-effective ways to drive quantifiable gains in both student retention/success rates and campus-wide health and environmental KPIs. The ROI is also compelling - as more and more students commit their PIPs for School, universities stand to recoup a greater percentage of their original investment (the annual PIPs subscription fee","3P Partners, Inc.",8538,University of Colorado Boulder,2130,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"digital tools,behavior change,affordability,web applications",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Spencer Turk,PIPs Rewards Associate,"3P Partners, Inc.",8538,Ashley Grosh,Business Representative,"3P Partners, Inc.",8538,Dave Newport,"Director, Environmental Center",University of Colorado Boulder,2130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Grosh_1284.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16126/1400_Grosh_1284.pdf,,,,,,
2390,Design a permaculture garden through a co-curricular and service learning experience.,The Office of Sustainability partnered with a Group Communication Class and local permaculture guild to established a community garden at Pikes Peak Community College's Centennial Campus. Communication students interviewed five stakeholder groups to understand what they wanted to see in the garden. The students collated the information and presented it to the stakeholders and permaculture designers. The Office of Sustainability worked with two teams from the permaculture guild to design a community garden. The Sustainability Coordinator combined elements from the designs and implemented them using partially donated material from local garden shops. The Coordinator worked with Communication Professor to asses students ability to demonstrate effective group communication. The results indicate that 100% of students participated in all of the activities and achieved the learning outcome. ,Pikes Peak Community College,1985,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Grounds,Public Engagement,,Sustainability Office,,"stakeholder engagement,gardens,permaculture,service learning",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Konrad Schlarbaum,Sustainability Coordinator,Pikes Peak Community College,1985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Schlarbaum_1716.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17567/1100_Schlarbaum_1716.pdf,,,,,,
2129,The Sustainable Development Goals: Needs and Challenges for Student-Led Implementation,"The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework is meant to provide a universal roadmap to end poverty and engage nations across the globe on common global issues. Student-led activation and initiatives are essential for the future directions and implementation of SDGs. Universities are crucibles for experimentation and facilitating new ideas to develop and foster change. Recognizing the importance of institutional and national level support for the successful implementation of the goals, the Government of Canada has recently launched a consultation process to inform the creation of Canada's forthcoming National Strategy on SDG Implementation. Using the SDG National Strategy as a springboard to discuss approaches for implementation of SDGs, this workshop will facilitate discussions on the challenges and needs for actualization of the goals. Students will explore the SDG framework and how it connects to and influence their lives by making tangible connections with their own values and skill-sets, as well as by identifying policy level changes needed to engage with the goals at the personal, institutional, and national level. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) Canada's mission is to catalyze and convene Canadian universities, colleges, and knowledge institutions to foster practical solutions and joint learning opportunities towards the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. With a wide range of student engagement programs, the University of British Columbia (UBC) is encouraging interdisciplinary discourse and innovative thinking toward achieving the global goals.

2367,Advancing Campus Sustainability Success Through an Interdisciplinary and Solutions-Oriented Approach,"Questions like: Can we build better, more sustainable, and with more resilience? What is the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) doing to reach its goals for sustainability on campus? Are just a few we asked ourselves in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence. On September 14th, 2018, Florence made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in Wilmington, NC. In the days following Florence's arrival, over 30 inches of rain was dropped in areas across North Carolina causing major flooding throughout the state. UNCW sustained minor to moderate damage to multiple buildings and residence halls, except for one building-Dobo Hall. Dobo Hall was built in 1996 and renovated a few years ago. It consisted of 21 rooms, 90 fume hoods, and housed the Departments of Biology & Marine Biology, and Chemistry & Biochemistry. Unfortunately, Dobo Hall had the most damage, which resulted in the decommissioning of the space as the university works to repair and renovate the structure. Under the pretense that global climate patterns are changing, it is important to recognize weather events like Hurricane Florence are not unprecedented anymore. In doing so, we can open ourselves to solutions focused on increasing sustainability and resiliency accounting for a changing climate. The first step to create this desired future was to gather information about how UNCW was making decisions about environmental stewardship and resiliency. For the scope of our project, we chose to focus on two different groups within this organization, the decision-makers and a subset of stakeholders, the students. Interviews were conducted with staff, administrators, and top-tier individuals at UNCW to understand how perceptions played into the construction of conversations and organizational decision-making. Additionally, surveys were randomly distributed to students to gauge awareness of environmental sustainability, their stake in the matter, and prioritization of green programs to implement on campus.","University of North Carolina, Wilmington",0740,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,"disaster & emergency response,stakeholder engagement",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Alexa Ott,Undergraduate Student,"University of North Carolina, Wilmington",0740,Michelle Whiting,Undergraduate Student,"University of North Carolina, Wilmington",0740,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2013,Linking Infamous History and Sustainability - 50 Years Since the 1969 Cuyahoga River Fire,"2019 marks 50 years since the last and most well-known time the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969. Much has changed for the better in Cleveland and across the United States since then, but many opportunities and challenges remain. Several colleges and universities in the Cuyahoga River watershed collaborated with governmental and non-profit organizations to recognize this anniversary and connect it with students and their surrounding communities. Join Kent State University (KSU), Cuyahoga Community College (Tri-C), and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) to hear commonalities, differences, and results from their approaches to recognizing this history. All three institutions have been actively involved in Sustainable Cleveland 2019, the City of Cleveland's 10-year sustainability initiative built toward recognizing the fire's 50th anniversary. Events were planned in partnership with the City of Cleveland and other regional organizations. KSU, Tri-C, and CWRU engaged students with the history, present-day successes and challenges, and future possibilities through curricular ties and special events. Although the history focuses mostly on environmental issues, events that took place in 2019 encouraged students to consider this along with social and economic justice, building a sustainable economy, and other additional aspects of sustainability. 2019's events allowed students to interpret sustainability from their own perspectives based on understanding the region's past, as well as current and future opportunities.

WWF-Canada is the country's largest international conservation organization, with the active support of hundreds of thousands of Canadians. They connect the power of a strong global network to on-the-ground conservation efforts across the nation, through various programs including Living Planet @ Campus (LP@C). Every post-secondary institution in Canada can be part of Living Planet @ Campus and encourage their students, staff and faculty in the practice of sustainability and the protection of nature on campus and beyond. LP@C and campus Sustainability Offices and leads work together to deliver inclusive, skill-building and impactful programming for students, our future sustainability leaders. A panel, made up of Fleming College, Niagara College Canada, and the University of Windsor (all participants in the LP@C program) will provide case studies of how WWF is able to help partner for student success and support a sustainable community locally and globally. Through LP@C students can earn WWF's Living Planet Leader designation, giving them the knowledge, skills and experience to lead in establishing sustainable systems and practices wherever they live and work. LP@C tracks student impact nationwide and provides students a tangible record of their contribution that they can leverage upon entering the job market in their respective fields.

1967,Interfaith Engagement for Climate Action and Advocacy,"We know sustainability challenges are not just technical but deeply human, rooted in our most fundamental values and identities. Too often, however, our sustainability initiatives are disconnected from religious organizations at our schools and in our communities that engage these deepest beliefs and practices. This session explores how we can more effectively integrate interfaith engagement into our campus sustainability strategies. Students and staff from Central College in Pella, Iowa will share lessons learned from several years of interfaith sustainability efforts both on campus and beyond. Central has a long history of faith-based social activism, and we have recovered this history as an important foundation for present day sustainability initiatives. Campus religious groups now integrate sustainability commitments into their regular service trips, utilizing reclaimed building materials in home construction projects. Collaboration between student sustainability and religious organizations has expanded participation in both. We have also developed connections between the college and diverse faith communities locally and across Iowa through a common commitment to climate justice. Through a partnership with Interfaith Power & Light, a team of students researched climate actions in faith communities statewide. This informed a series of advocacy workshops across Iowa. These workshops empowered students and other citizens of faith to support climate legislation through letters, lobbying, and visits to the state capital and to Washington, D.C. Most recently, this work culminated in an interfaith conference for Iowa college students focused on faith, climate change, and political advocacy, in the months prior to the 2020 presidential caucus. At Central's campus and across the state, this interfaith engagement in sustainability has fostered unlikely relationships, challenged stereotypes, and established common ground for climate action.",Central College,4371,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,"religion & spirituality,community engagement,climate action,advocacy",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Brian Campbell,Director of Sustainability Education,Central College,4371,Megan Beuter,Undergraduate Student,Central College,4371,Savanna Henning,Undergraduate Student,Central College,4371,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Campbell_1717.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16308/0830_Campbell_1717.pptx,,,,,,

2067,From Energy to Apathy: Maintaining Positive Momentum on Student-Run Initiatives,"The greatest non-mandated catalyst for change at a college or university is the organized and educated student voice. A harmonized student voice creates the leaps in programming that are needed to continue transitioning to more sustainable campuses. These abrupt leaps forward can be accompanied by both positive and negative impacts. In 2009, the state of Iowa saw one of these leaps forward in sustainability. Due to student and public interest, the Iowa Board of Regents created a sustainability plan for the three public universities in the state. This was the catalyst for change that empowered students and created the coordinated sustainability programs seeing at Iowa State University, the University of Iowa, and the University of Northern Iowa. Creation of these offices, led to motivated student bodies, ready to make massive impacts on campus through student programs. While we routinely focus on all of the positives in telling our stories and selling these projects, the more complicated impacts routinely fall on the more negative side of the coin. A desire to declare a problem 'fixed', lack of follow through, and competing interests are just some of the common dilemmas that are faced while working with student-driven projects. This session will focus on how to address these issued during program development and focus on strategies that can be used across a wide range of program and institution types. The One Sustainability Iowa initiative was a network created by Iowa State University in association with the ten year anniversary of their coordinated campus sustainability efforts. This effort has united student efforts at all public/private educational institutions in Iowa. As a result, we now have a thriving network that helps students to share ideas, work through project planning processes across institutional boundaries, and hosts a repository of projects and case study materials.",University of Northern Iowa,3690,Iowa State University,3118,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,"students,inter-campus collaboration",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Eric O'Brien,Director of Sustainability,University of Northern Iowa,3690,Merry Rankin,Director of Sustainability,Iowa State University,3118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_OBrien_1389.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16692/1400_OBrien_1389.pdf,,,,,,
2125,Tools to Support Your Professional Development and Reach Your Campus Group Goals,"We know students are doing amazing things on campuses across the world. However, groups are often working in isolation or have to go up a steep learning curve to try to affect change. This session will introduce you to support, training and development opportunities outside of your campus that are available to you. It aims to help build collective capacity to ensure students in groups have the skills, attributes, and knowledge to be effective sustainability change makers. As such, we will provide participants with tools, advice, and resources to help widen the reach of their work and create long-term, transformational change in habits, behaviors, and processes on campus and beyond. You'll leave not just with some new ideas, but knowing how to access support and development opportunities to help you thrive. Specifically, the session will: Help forge a shared identity between student groups across the country and beyond Discuss methods to improve stakeholder engagement to be Net Gain for participants. Assessment of the opportunities being provided to sustainability students or club members. Share ways that student changemakers can access training, tools and resources to enable them to effectively engage their campus & community.

2084,Cool Campus Challenge - Engaging Campuses in Carbon Neutrality to Create a Culture of Sustainability,"The University of California's Cool Campus Challenge is a friendly 4-week competition between all ten campuses in the UC system designed to educate and motivate the campus community (students, faculty, and staff) to take simple energy-saving, waste reducing and sustainability-focused actions to lower their carbon footprint. The Challenge has been built around principles of community based social marketing. It is designed to increase education and awareness to engage the community in achieving the University's goal of being carbon neutral by 2025, generate lasting behavior shifts that create a culture of sustainability on our campuses, and provide participants with an understanding of the issues involved with creating and participating in a sustainable economy. A pilot of this program in 2015 engaged nearly 20,000 participants who took over 130,000 individual actions, making it one of the largest behavior-based climate change programs in the country. During this session, we will present the results of the 2019 Challenge, which has a stated goal of increasing participation to engage over 30,000 members of our campuses. We will discuss the campaign results and the extensive evaluation of the factors that activate, educate, motivate, and empower participants to take action for lasting change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We will highlight the replicable elements built into the Challenge's design that made it a success. We will also lead a discussion (with examples) of the outreach approaches used by individual campuses and how those campuses leverage the competition to build awareness and relationships that extend well beyond the formal end of the Challenge. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how to use gamification to improve the effectiveness of their outreach and engagement efforts - and how simple, fun, and social campaigns can harness social networks to magnify the impact of those efforts leading to tangible emissions reductions.","University of California, Office of the President",4144,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,"competitions,climate neutrality,Cool Campus Challenge,behavior change",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Ryan Bell,Associate Director of Sustainability,"University of California, Office of the President",4144,Kira Stoll,Director of Sustainability,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Bell_1746.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16743/0830_Bell_1746.pptx,,,,,,
1885,#Strategy: Creating an Intentional Approach to Social Media,"Social media is a powerful tool for amplifying sustainability messaging and connecting with audiences of all ages, demographics and interests. All too often, however, managing social media can feel overwhelming and unrewarding, or it is viewed as a low priority, an afterthought, or is dismissed as being unimportant to the success of a sustainability program. Sound familiar? You're not alone - and whether you're part of a large team, or a team of one - you can develop a well-rounded social media strategy that will streamline your efforts, add value to your communications, and enhance the visibility and impact of your programs and initiatives. This workshop will walk participants through the process of creating a strategy that can serve as a guiding resource for developing a more robust and engaging social media presence. The University of Florida's Office of Sustainability communication team will give a brief overview of their social media strategy development and how they successfully implemented tactics that built community, engaged their followers, and increased meaningful participation in behavior-change campaigns. Attendees will learn about some of the key elements of a successful social media strategy such as developing a clear and consistent voice, understanding the importance of timing, and creating tailored content to maximize audience engagement. Facilitators will also touch on topics including audience analytics, performance tracking, and tips for effectively using hashtags, multimedia content, and more. Participants will receive a content strategy workbook and will be guided through the process of completing different components throughout the session, working with their peers and facilitators to brainstorm new ideas and tactics along the way. As a result, attendees will leave with a new network of communicators and an actionable strategy framework that can be immediately applied to their organization's social media communications.",University of Florida,2088,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,Communications & Marketing,Sustainability Office,"communications,social media,Communications Track",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Allison Vitt,Outreach and Communications Coordinator,University of Florida,2088,Hannah Ulloa,Design and Marketing,University of Florida,2088,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Ulloa_1224.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16094/1100_Ulloa_1224.pdf,1100_Ulloa_1224_1104_162257.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16094/1100_Ulloa_1224_1104_162257.pdf,,,,

1893,Building a Consistent Sustainability Brand,"In order to reap the full benefits of consistently communicating the values and messages that are core to your sustainability brand, it is important to design brand guidelines that define the look of your communications and materials. Brand guidelines are a powerful tool that create a consistent look and feel so communications and design projects are easily recognized by faculty, staff, students, alumni, and visitors, and communicate the key sustainability values of the university. Through brand guidelines, your campus community will come to know and recognize the sustainability brand through the consistent presentation and expression of the brand in all communications and marketing. But how do you get started? What is the path to developing brand guidelines? Who needs to be involved? In this session, we will discuss Lehigh University's path to developing a branding guide, how you can choose branding elements that harmonize with your school's visual identity elements, and how you can apply the concepts in physical materials. The discussion will include topics such as core brand objectives, logo (simple and full versions), color palette (primary and extended), typeface standards, image usage guidelines, and identity elements - do's and don'ts. The utilization of a cohesive sustainability image and brand is very important.",Lehigh University,4140,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,"communications,Communications Track,branding",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Katharine Targett Gross,Sustainability Officer,Lehigh University,4140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_TargettGross_1261.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18465/0830_TargettGross_1261.pptx,,,,,,
1902,How to Structure Collaborations and Communicate Wins Effectively as an Office of One,"With diversity and inclusivity at the core, we envision this session serving those who are either new to the industry or have years of experience - students and staff alike. Communication and messaging continuing to grow in importance, especially at institutions and in states that are more conservative. At NAU, the Office of Sustainability has successfully completed a reorganization, restructure, and visioning effort with one staff position and 21 student workers. We have many great initiatives, but needed to reestablish our communication channels messaging to increase buy-in with administration and awareness across campus. We engaged in strategic collaborations on campus with marketing and graphic design programs as we worked to rebrand and restructure our communication outputs as an office of one staff person. We modeled a weekly bullet newsletter called the 'Green Flash' by using other industry examples that connects our Listservs to events and green highlights focused on additional sustainability efforts on campus and use the Green Flash to promoting their successes. We have built a working relationship between the university and the City of Flagstaff's Sustainability sector. In that effort, we have a Community Coordinator student worker position to cross the divide which has played a major role in strengthening community relationships with the university. We are now working to align our climate action plans with the city as we move forward with them to reach carbon neutrality. We would like to share our case study with the conference community to learn more tactics and initiatives others have utilized to gain further advice on how to move our efforts forward, as an office of one staff person with a dynamite group of student workers.",Northern Arizona University,0567,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,Sustainability Office,,"communications,vision,Communications Track",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Matthew Muchna,Sustainability Manager,Northern Arizona University,0567,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Muchna_1343.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16139/0830_Muchna_1343.pptx,,,,,,

2146,Innovations in Sustainable Office Certification,"Is your Sustainable Office Program working, but not reaching its full potential? Over the last year, Lehigh University and the University of Calgary both relaunched their Sustainable Office Programs to expand campus engagement and increase activity on campus. Both programs are voluntary and encourage staff to lead in a variety of topic areas to promote sustainable practices in the workplace. Join us to hear case studies from both Lehigh University and the University of Calgary as well as a discussion on the in depth the process of creating these programs and their accompanying resources. We will also discuss key lessons learned, best practices, and challenges. Through efforts like this, institutions can continue to increase overall campus engagement, build community, and enhance the culture of sustainability on their campus.

2314,Student Governments as Platforms for Sustainability Efforts,"Many sustainability efforts on college campuses are student-driven, however, the majority of the students leading these efforts tend to be involved in sustainability-related organizations or employees of their university's sustainability office. This presentation will focus on how to use student governments as platforms to create institutional change in terms of sustainability. In the case of The University of Denver's Undergraduate Student Government (USG), several amendments were proposed in order to include more sustainability efforts during the process of re-writing the finance manual. DU's USG proposed and passed a single-use plastic ban on purchases with student funds. Along with this amendment, the Sustainability Committee houses a compost closet where students can request compostable serve-ware at no cost in order to make their event more sustainable and to curb the costs associated with the ban and compostable products. Additionally, an amendment to include the purchasing of carbon offsets whenever USG funds student flights for conferences and competitions was proposed and passed. Not only was the carbon offset amendment passed but it determined that carbon offsets would be purchased through Cool Effect's Native American Project, which is a local Colorado methane capturing project done by the Ute Tribe. In an effort to tackle both social and environmental sustainability efforts, it is imperative to use student government bodies and their funding powers to demonstrate student support and engagement of sustainable practices and to also lead the way for institutional change.",University of Denver,2186,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Purchasing,,,,,"student government,organizational change,single-use plastic,compostable dining materials,carbon offsets",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Sophia Gonzalez-Mayagoitia,Undergraduate Student,University of Denver,2186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1954,Green Office Certification: Evaluating for Impact,"Green office certification programs can play an important role in changing organizational behavior. But how do we evaluate and measure the effectiveness of these programs? What type of data is being collected? Beyond outreach and engagement numbers, how are we evaluating the program, measuring impact, and connecting the results to larger sustainability initiatives within an institution? Using data from a case study of the University of Utah, evaluating the direct impact of Green Office Certification on eco-friendly purchasing practices, this presentation will explore what data to collect and how to measure direct impact. Furthermore, we will discuss how this framework could be used to measure impact in other areas that connect directly to sustainability initiatives, in addition to leveraging green office certification for collective impact, communications, and relationship building to achieve goals set out by the institution such as carbon neutrality.",University of Utah,3994,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"green office,office certifications",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Karren Fultz,Sustainability Officer,University of Utah,3994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Fultz_1660.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16268/0830_Fultz_1660.pdf,,,,,,
2311,Campus Sustainability: Using Planned Behavior Theory to Assess Student's Pro-Environmental Behavior,"Over the few past decades, sustainability has increased in importance both in policymaking and academic discourse. A concern that economic progress and overconsumption and accumulation of waste operate against principles of healthy, livable precincts and the planet in a way that is not sustainable frequently fuels debates and analytical studies. Sustainability, in short, refers to an approach to living or development that considers meeting present needs without compromising future needs. Core to this definition is the need and motivation to use available environmental resources in a way that does minimal or no harm to the planet's ability to replenish these resources or in a way that does not undermine the lives of generations to come. Environmental psychologists have categorized this conscious way of living and relationship to the natural environment as 'pro-environmental' behavior. Thus, one way to assess the sustainability of a system is by looking at the pro-environmental behaviors of the people who ascribe to or are part of a given system. In the current study, by examining students' pro-environmental behaviors, this study seeks to illuminate sustainability issues and trends at Missouri State University. The purpose of this research project is to understand what factors motivate or inhibit a student's pro-environmental behavior. The study acknowledges that students will care if their knowledge, values, beliefs and perceived control of behaviors match their motivation to adopt environmentally friendly behaviors. College students are an important population because they are starting to form their behaviors and habits, which will be carried throughout adulthood and taught to the next generation. The study also expects to inform campus policy on sustainability, enhance sustainability literacy and motivate positive behaviors that are friendly to the natural environment and living spaces. Findings will also be used to inform MSU's STARS reporting with AASHE.",Missouri State University,4525,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"motivation,behavioral sciences,student attitudes,behavior change",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Bernard Kitheka,Assistant Professor,Missouri State University,4525,Talita Menezes,Graduate Student,Missouri State University,4525,Kenya Reeves,Student,Missouri State University,4525,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Menezes_1168.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18169/1100_Menezes_1168.pptx,,,,,,
2493,Climate Change Attitudes and Practices of Students : A Comparison Among Mennonite Colleges,"Students at college and university campuses are often on the leading edge of social change, and thus might be expected to show increased concern and actions in response to the threat of climate change. While survey instruments (such as the widely used 6 Americas methodology) are effectively documenting the variation in climate change attitudes and practices in various segments of society, to date there is little specific information for college campuses. This project characterized students at Mennonite colleges in the United States using a survey that incorporated 6 Americas components, along with additional questions, and indicated some key similarities and differences between campuses. Although political and religious identities of campus communities varied between the campuses, all campuses showed high levels of concern about climate change. There was strong support for personal and institutional actions related to climate change, including a consistent desire among students to set carbon neutrality targets on their campus. Although students believed humans can address climate change, most were skeptical that humans would actually meet the challenge. There were clear differences in the level of student engagement on campus, with some campuses having notably more active student sustainability organizations, or institutional actions. Despite these differences, students across all campuses show low levels of engagement with public officials, a focus on small lifestyle changes, and a lack of understanding on some components of climate change. Liberal arts institutions with religious roots are especially interesting in purporting a particular strong moral underpinning for attitudes and practices. Mennonite colleges are positioned between a conservative tradition, and a more progressive religious interpretation of what it means to engage society, and thus provide unique insights into how students are responding to climate change.",Eastern Mennonite University,7923,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"faith-based institutions,student attitudes,surveys",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Doug Graber Neufeld,Faculty,Eastern Mennonite University,7923,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2203,Collecting Actionable Data Using the Sustainability/Climate Change Survey,"To better understand the campus community's perspectives on climate change, sustainability, and resilience issues, the sustainability office, and the institutional research office administered the first Earth Day Survey in spring, 2018. The IR office analyzed and processed a large amount of qualitative data and developed an innovative online data tool to disseminate both quantitative and qualitative survey data to all students and employees. Results show that 95% of the campus community are concerned about sustainability and climate change issues. The three issues people concerned the most are global warming, ocean and beach, and consumer culture. The valuable information collected from the earth day survey helps the university to develop practical strategies to achieve sustainable goals. Following are the four survey implementation areas: 1) Increase visibility about sustainability challenges and solutions; 2) Students are interested in sustainability-related courses, majors, and careers; 3) Provide options for people to make more sustainable lifestyle choices; and 4) Keep the community informed of progress on the university's sustainability goals, community's feedback to improve our campus, and opportunities to contribute. Aiming to bring awareness of sustainability issues among the campus community using the survey results, we created video presentations, conducted campus data sharing events, and collaborated with the communication office to develop news stories. We also focused on developing actional plans and campus implementations using the survey results. This presentation demonstrates how multiple offices can utilizing their different skill sets and resources to effectively collecting and using actionable data to support sustainability initiatives.

2016,The Power of Small Steps: Making Psychology Accessible to Practitioners Through Small Experiments,"Campus sustainability offices are often expected to create sustainable, durable cultural change without inconveniencing the students, faculty, or staff at the universities and colleges at which they work. This task is further complicated by the unique campus cultures found at every school. Considering these challenges, the pressure to develop effective communication campaigns and behavior change programs is daunting. This pressure may be alleviated by engaging in 'small experiments,' which allow practitioners and researchers to test their ideas on a small scale in their unique campus communities. Collectively, the information gathered allow practitioners to determine if their ideas are worth scaling up or if they should instead focus their attention to future projects. These experiments allow practitioners to test their intuition, gather preliminary data, and, most importantly of all, move forward in their work without becoming hindered by indecision or uncertainty. This talk will provide audience members with guidelines to follow when developing their own small experiments focused on communication and behavior change campaigns on university and college campuses. These guidelines will be supplemented with strategies and tools from the fields of research methodology and the psychological sciences to best support practitioners in organizing small experiments. Audience members will be introduced to principles of data collection (regarding literature reviews, surveys, interviews, and focus groups), basic data analysis and interpretation, how to incorporate findings into communications and behavior change campaigns, and how to best evaluate the results of these campaigns upon completion.",University of Michigan,1744,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Research,,,Sustainability Office,,"communications,behavior change,psychology,applied research,research methods,Communications Track",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Jess Lasoff-Santos,PhD Student,University of Michigan,1744,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_LasoffSantos_1478.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16495/1445_LasoffSantos_1478.pdf,,,,,,
2121,Reuse Economy in Action: Planning Campus Events to Cultivate a Circular Consumption Culture,"This workshop will focus on organizing campus events that foster a circular economy of consumption. At Carleton College, we hold two events each year to promote this. The Repair Fair is a matchmaking event that pairs items in need of repair with local 'repairers.' The Free & For Sale Frenzy is a pop-up consignment shop on campus, open to students selling and purchasing clothing. Both events are great opportunities to engage campuses, and broader campus communities, challenging them to consider the true impacts of their consumption. The Repair Fair was first held as a collaborative event between Carleton's Sustainability Office and PLAN (Post-Landfill Action Network). We invite a number of community repair experts, ranging from experts in bikes to sewing to instruments. The intention is to draw a large number of students and community members, helping them to realize that linear consumption (buy-use-dispose) isn't the only option! The Free & For Sale Frenzy targets the campus market for used clothing. Students bring in their unwanted used (or sometimes new) clothing and price it. The clothes are arranged into a makeshift store for a day and students are invited to shop. All unsold clothes are donated to local organizations and thrift stores. This pop-up consignment shop is a service organized by the Sustainability Office to encourage a circular clothing economy. The Repair Fair and the Free & For Sale Frenzy can be held as separate events, but they also work well as joint events. These events have now become institutionalized and part of the Sustainability Office's ongoing services to campus. At this session, attendees will learn best practices for hosting an event that promotes a circular economy.",Post-Landfill Action Network,6582,Carleton College,2821,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Waste,,,,,"consumption,circular economy,waste reduction,reuse",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Kayla Conway,Atlas Zero Waste Strategist,Post-Landfill Action Network,6582,Emma Leither,Sustainability Office Student Worker,Carleton College,2821,Alexandra Miller,Sustainability Program Coordinator,Carleton College,2821,Yu-Shien Ni,Atlas Zero Waste Strategist,Post-Landfill Action Network,6582,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1300_Leither_1447.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16861/1300_Leither_1447.pdf,1300_Leither_1447_1118_114644.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16861/1300_Leither_1447_1118_114644.pdf,1300_Leither_1447.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16864/1300_Leither_1447.pdf,,
2496,Award Winner Session: The High Costs of Sustainable Operations: Institutional Purpose and the Quadruple Bottom Line,"Increasing sustainability performance and reducing overall operating expenses are broad goals that are simultaneously present at nearly all universities. This paper presents an exploratory case study in which a major sustainability initiative at a large university was fully implemented despite leadership knowledge that the operating costs would far exceed initial projections. The study is of a comprehensive waste management program in which university employees collect, sort, and dispose of personal office waste. Labor costs of the program were calculated using an opportunity costing method. To explain why universities often pursue economically costly sustainability programs, the authors propose the existence of a quadruple bottom line framework (QBL) in which university leaders consider the impact of a sustainability initiative on their organization's mission or purpose. By applying a QBL framework, the benefits of a comprehensive waste management program are much more pronounced. HEI administrators may conclude that sustainability programs having little or no financial benefits are indeed worthwhile when those programs align with and support the educational mission of their institution. This paper is valuable to any higher education professional involved with the implementation of sustainability initiatives, particularly those related to waste management programs.",Pennsylvania State University,4190,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Waste,,,,,"waste management,waste reduction,quadruple bottom line",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Nathaniel Elser,PhD Candidate,Pennsylvania State University,4190,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Elser_1906.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18223/0830_Elser_1906.pdf,,,,,,
2149,Fostering Student Engagement and Learning Through Campus Gardens,"Leah McCord, AmeriCorps VISTA member serving at the University of Tennessee Office of Sustainability, will share her office's experience of proposing and implementing the Grow Lab. The Grow Lab is an organic campus garden that works to address food insecurity and provide a real world experiential learning environment for multiple departments on campus. The Grow Lab is working to direct the next wave of professionals - from Agriculturists, Horticulturists, Plant & Soil Scientists, Sustainable Landscape Designers, Architects, and Urban Planners to Social Workers, Journalists, Film Makers, Educators, and more- to keep access to healthy food as one of their foundational principles. Leah will share some of the challenges and successes beginning and growing a campus produce garden and changing the food culture. She will discuss the process of getting approval- including overcoming challenges from Administration-, recruiting and maintaining student workers and volunteers, developing partnerships on campus and in the community, and securing buy-in from other departments to increase educational opportunities. Elijah Freiman, a student at State University of New York Geneseo, will share information about their eGarden project. The eGarden represents a collaborative, interdisciplinary response from students to combat environmental degradation from current agricultural methods. Through a partnership with SUNY Geneseo's Office of Sustainability & Campus Auxiliary Services (CAS), the garden has acted as a tool to promote the importance of locally grown food, as well as sustainable agriculture practices. To date, the eGarden has produced over 150 pounds of fruits, vegetables, and herbs which have been incorporated into daily meals at on-campus dining facilities. The eGarden is entirely run by students who provide daily maintenance through weeding, watering, and harvesting produce. The eGarden allows for student interns to experiment with different sustainable agricultural practices, such as using compost that has been collected from our campus-wide composting program and pair gardening.

2332,Engaging Students in Sustainability,"My presentation will cover two initiatives I led on my campus at IUPUI. The first is the Yoga in the Garden event series for students, faculty, and staff. It is well known that yoga can greatly improve physical health. For both beginner and experienced yogis, practicing outside provides an environment that awakens the senses. One reason I decided to start a yoga series is because of the emotional burden that was taken away from me when I started practicing yoga. It is not uncommon to hear about the stress college students face, I wanted to create a program that would address that issue. There have been many studies done showing that environments can increase or reduce our stress levels; Exposure to nature reduces anger, fear, stress, and increases pleasant emotions. A significant part of this event was attendees having the opportunity to harvest and take home their own vegetables, bridging the gap between farm and table. I wanted to increase awareness of how infrequently we know where our food comes from. Typical produce travels over 1,500 miles to end up on our tables. Harvesting directly from the garden was the perfect way to demonstrate produce that doesn't have a carbon footprint and encourage urban gardening! The second initiative I will discuss is the Green Greek Movement. Through my experiences in college thus far, I have determined the university context is the perfect setting to integrate sustainable values into daily practices. The time students spend at their university is some of the most influential times and experiences that they will have.

2345,Intersectionality of Student-Led Projects at State University of New York at Geneseo,"The SUNY Geneseo Office of Sustainability has five major projects that help direct our campus towards the advancement of a sustainable economy. These student-led and organized projects include composting, the e-garden, biodiesel production, Greek life sustainability, and events and outreach. Our wide range of academic and extracurricular backgrounds provide a unique platform that fosters the creation of an interdisciplinary web of projects that have transformed the campus community. Because our project leaders come from many majors and are involved in various programs both on and off campus, they bring unique perspectives that enhance the diversity of our sustainability program. The diversity of projects in our sustainability program allows our campus community members with various interests to get involved in projects they specifically relate to. With this greater involvement opportunity, our department has grown significantly in the past few years. Our five-part presentation will discuss how the five main projects intersect to shape the direction of the Sustainability Office in order to grow the awareness of sustainability on campus and bring our campus community closer to our goal of participating in a sustainable economy. We will discuss how our waste disposal strategies, such as composting and conversion of waste fryer oil to biodiesel, help SUNY Geneseo reduce both monetary and environmental waste removal costs. We will also discuss how the efforts of our Greek life sustainability leaders and events coordinators involve community members to increase outreach and spread sustainability efforts on campus. Finally, we will include a review of how our e-garden committee works with Campus Auxiliary Services to serve locally grown food on campus. All our projects, which are bolstered by our project leader diversity, intersect to bring SUNY Geneseo closer toward our goal of becoming an active member in a sustainable economy.

2026,Changing Behavior and Measuring Impact Through EcoChallenge: Campus Case Studies,"We know that our unsustainability issues are urgent and vast. If we are to create a society and an economy that are sustainable and regenerative, educational institutions need to simultaneously transform mental models and frameworks while igniting behavior change on a comprehensive scale. EcoChallenge is a free social change platform that offers both faculty and staff tools to engage their students and/or other audiences in values exploration and immediate individual behavior change while contributing to larger organizational change at the same time. EcoChallenge measures impact in real time to help institutions both achieve and communicate their success in achieving their sustainability and engagement goals. This session will showcase one of many ways educational institutions, nonprofits, and businesses can collaborate to address the root causes of climate change and unsustainability. We will outline the learning theory and behavior change theory used to develop EcoChallenge and explain how the EcoChallenge platform can be used to address climate change, change behavior, and measure impact through case studies presented by two different campus users: - Clara Steyer, Sustainability Coordinator at Washington University in St. Louis, who used Campus EcoChallenge to engage 117 residential students during their 4-week Green Cup competition - Lindsey Lyons, Assistant Director of the Center for Sustainability Education at Dickinson College, who has used multiple EcoChallenge events to engage hundreds of students over the past few years",EcoChallenge.org,9515,Dickinson College,3185,Washington University in St. Louis,5993,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"behavior change,student engagement",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Lacy Cagle,Director of Learning,EcoChallenge.org,9515,Liz Zavodsky,Director of Organizational Development,EcoChallenge.org,9515,Lindsey Lyons,Assistant Director,Dickinson College,3185,Clara Steyer,Sustainability Coordinator,Washington University in St. Louis,5993,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Cagle_1545.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16531/1445_Cagle_1545.pdf,,,,,,
2006,How to Engage Students to Get More Done,"As institutions of higher education, we know that engaging students is a top priority - plus it enriches the work we do every day by bringing in fresh ideas, energy and perspectives. Sometimes it is difficult to balance these meaningful student learning opportunities with accomplishing what we need to do. This presentation will outline a few different ways that campuses have successfully worked with students to get more done and give each participant an opportunity to think about what would work best on their own campus. Examples include: 1. Student Leadership model of internships where students are mentored in a cohort to provide more value to the office and each other; 2. Summer programs where students work with 'clients' on specific projects; 3. Using upperclassmen to manage small teams of less experienced students; and 4. Empowering students to design their own solutions to problems in certain focus areas. Each campus will give a short presentation on their unique program and then the group will break up into roundtable discussions facilitated by each presenter so that we can all learn from one another.",Bentley University,0854,Ramapo College of New Jersey,1578,Tufts University,2659,Williams College,0059,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"student engagement,student leadership",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Natalie Hayes,Assistant Director of Sustainability,Bentley University,0854,Ashwani Vasishth,"Associate Professor, Director, Center for Sustainability,",Ramapo College of New Jersey,1578,Tina Woolston,Sustainability Program Director,Tufts University,2659,Caroline Bruno,"Assistant Director, Zilkha Center for Environmental Initiatives",Williams College,0059,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Bruno_1425.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16453/1100_Bruno_1425.pptx,,,,,,

2116,The Value of Student Advocacy in Galvanizing Institutional Change,"Representatives of an Amherst College student organization, Students for Climate Action (SCA), will discuss successful strategies for mobilizing students and pressuring college administrations in favor of carbon neutrality initiatives. This program will focus on how SCA leveraged student support for the 'Student Voices from the Frontlines of Climate Change' event to push Amherst College's Climate Action Plan forward. At this event, staff representatives from the Office of Sustainability outlined the proposed Climate Action Plan, and students spoke about the destruction that climate change imposes on their local communities and voiced their support for the measure. In response to the event and continued lobbying efforts by SCA, Amherst College passed the Climate Action Plan on an accelerated timeline of 2030, rather than the proposed 2035. SCA's presentation on this case study will provide insight to audience members on how to mobilize students and pressure college administrations in favor of climate action on their own campuses. The representatives will discuss strategies for collaborating with various student groups to advertise advocacy events and seek participants. Presenters will also discuss tactics for ensuring upper-level college administrators attend and are attentive to student advocacy events. Finally, the presenters will discuss the importance of ensuring advocacy events are not one-time initiatives that are forgotten. SCA followed up on the event through discussions with the College President, Board of Trustees, and Office of Environmental Sustainability. It was this combination of an impactful student event, coupled with continued conversations between students and college administrators, that led to the College's formal commitment to carbon neutrality. In addition to speaking, this presentation will include video footage from the events, images of advertising materials, and a Q&A session.",Amherst College,2649,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"students,advocacy,student organizations,climate action plans",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Julian Brubaker,Undergraduate Student,Amherst College,2649,Gabriel Echarte,Undergraduate Student,Amherst College,2649,Hunter Lampson,Student,Amherst College,2649,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1130_Lampson_1535.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16847/1130_Lampson_1535.pptx,,,,,,
2078,"Disrupting Traditional Economic Models in Support of Sustainability, Practical Examples","The Sustainability Office at Bemidji State University in northern Minnesota works to support its students and community in innovative ways that also uproot the dysfunctional economic system causing the continued rise in carbon emissions. The community has one of the highest poverty rates in the state, so finding ways to make sustainable behaviors accessible and affordable are critical. The campus FreeStore collects donations of no longer used yet still usable items, particularly through a 'Donate, Don't Dumpster' campaign at the end of each academic semester. Students are then able to take items they find in the FreeStore at no cost - which has diverted thousands of items (clothing, kitchenware, shoes, office supplies, etc.) from the landfill and prevented unnecessary expense from purchasing anew. BSU also provides students with a long-term lease opportunity through their bike-share program, allowing students to rent bikes for a semester. This extremely low-cost option provides students a form of transportation completely divorced from the petroleum industry. Traditional Skills Workshops provide instructional opportunities to build capacity for a 'DIY' mentality - recent examples include natural toothpaste and deodorant creation and basics of homebrewing kombucha. We also feel our campus garden and native landscaping initiatives move our campus and community in the direction of lower reliance upon inputs, be they of time, energy, or money. Our presentation will outline these examples and more, while also creating space to brainstorm additional ways you can disrupt the traditional economic models at your own institutions.",Bemidji State University,4554,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"reuse,free stores,affordability",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Erika Bailey-Johnson,Sustainability Director,Bemidji State University,4554,Jordan Lutz,Sustainability Project Manager,Bemidji State University,4554,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Lutz_1601.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16726/1400_Lutz_1601.pdf,,,,,,
2504,Award Winner Session: The Ladder of Staff Engagement: Programs Designed to Move From Individual Steps to Collective Action,"There is often tension between the focus on individual behavioral action and systemic change in sustainability circles. How do we encourage the small steps that engage community members on a personal level, without the goal of systemic change getting lost in the mix? Is there a way for staff and student engagement programs to achieve both goals? This session covers how sustainability practitioners can use the Ladder of Engagement model to turn small, personal steps into meaningful, collective action by designing programs that build on success to implement more impactful and ambitious change. Using examples from McGill University, participants will see how thoughtfully designed programs enable community members to move up the Ladder, such as navigating from tending to their own on-campus garden plot to committing to their own Unit-Level Climate and Sustainability Action Plan.

2082,Personal Sustainability: The Sixth 'P' of Sustainable Development,"The normative power of sustainable development is to guide the future of the species and to scale the operationalization of SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). The SDGs are designed to transform unsustainable systems so that they can perpetually endure with minimal exploitation. Within this framework, the Five Ps of sustainable development are promoted: Peace, Prosperity, People, Planet, and Partnerships. However, achieving these goals requires a shift in the 'mental models' underpinning the systems in which the SDGs would be embedded. This presentation will discuss the role of the individual in shifting 'mental models' by exploring a sixth 'P' of Personal Sustainability. At the College of Charleston, Personal Sustainability has been the foundational pillar of sustainability (for last 5 years) and it also acts as a gateway to scalable approaches and action within the SDGs. The focus of the presentation will be on explaining the essential elements of personal sustainability; that is, to discover one's 'fit and purpose' in the systems in which they are embedded and to operationalize his/her values in ways that generate social change. Simply, it is a pathway to more advanced forms of consciousness that naturally lead to recognizing the power of interconnection within the (unsustainable) systems that we operate. This pathway builds personal resilience, which facilitates investment in social change. Ironically, the process itself changes the 'mental model' that support the key tenants of the SDGs, while also providing a critical entry point into the social and political spheres of sustainability. For students, it shifts not only their mental model, but it humanizes sustainability in pragmatic and professional ways that empower and strengthen their career and life paths.",College of Charleston,5047,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"social change,values,individual action,Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,P.

WWF-Canada is the country's largest international conservation organization, connecting the power of a strong global network to on-the-ground conservation efforts across the nation through programs including Living Planet @ Campus (LP@C). Every post-secondary student in Canada can be part of LP@C and encourage their campus, faculty and staff in the practice of sustainability and the protection of nature on campus and beyond. LP@C works together with Campus Partners to deliver inclusive, skill-building and impactful programming for students, our future sustainability leaders. Through LP@C, students can earn WWF's Living Planet Leader designation, giving them the knowledge, skills and experience to lead in establishing sustainable systems and practices wherever they live and work. LP@C's certification tracks student impact nationwide and provides students a tangible record of their contribution that they can leverage upon entering the job market in their respective fields. LP@C is not exclusive to environmentally focused academic programs, so the potential exists for students to innovate and create a sustainability economy across many sectors. This session will provide an open dialogue on the benefits and challenges students experience in driving sustainability through volunteerism, academics, leadership, and teamwork - key pillars of the certificate. The session will provide students the opportunity to workshop the certificate, enhance their understanding on how to build professional experience with sustainable actions, and provide recommendations on how the program and certificate can be made more accessible and valuable to post-secondary students. While Living Planet Leader is currently available only in Canada, students and institutions from other countries are encouraged to engage in the workshop to shape and inform the certification model.",World Wildlife Fund,7672,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,"student leadership,Canada",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Kathy Nguyen,Employee,World Wildlife Fund,7672,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1015_Nguyen_1910.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18266/1015_Nguyen_1910.pdf,,,,,,
2252,Accounting for Ecochauvinism: Ideological Challenges and Anti-Environmentalism,"This poster examines 'ecochauvinism,' an ideological and practical counterpart to ecofeminism and conceptual frame that debuted before the Western States Communication Association's Environmental Communication Division in Seattle, Washington, earlier this year. The term draws on both initial definitions of chauvinism (irrational in-group pride and devotion; belief in personal superiority and the inevitable inferiority of others; open hostility toward other ways of being) and male chauvinism, in particular. The poster argues that the patriotic, partisan, and macho chauvinisms of the current day contribute to and compile with actively anti-environmental sentiments, then presents tips and techniques for addressing ecochauvinism on campus and in classrooms. Building upon Brough et al.'s (2016) findings that men are apt to avoid environmentally friendly actions, sentiments, and ideas as feminine or unmanly, it argues that in the current era some populations are not merely avoiding environmentally friendly actions as feminine but also (and moreover) valorizing and adopting aggressively anti-environmentalist actions as explicitly manly ones. These actions include, for example, trophy hunting, rolling coal, and toppling rock formations. The poster ultimately argues that ecochauvinism exists as a potent ideological counterforce to ecofeminism in ongoing environmental dialogues. Ecochauvinism positions the masculine human actor as superior to the feminist more-than-human and, moreover, aggressively asserts that superiority in action and discourse, giving a new meaning to 'toxic masculinity.' Its suggestions for addressing and accounting for ecochauvinism speak to patterns on campuses across the country.",Gonzaga University,2258,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,,,,,,"values,gender,women,men,chauvinism",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Casey Schmitt,Assistant Professor of Communication Studies,Gonzaga University,2258,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Schmitt_1378.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17198/1530_Schmitt_1378.pdf,,,,,,

2364,5 Engagement Lessons I Wish I Knew as a Campus Sustainability Officer,"Engagement is at the core of sustainability. Without proper buy-in from campus stakeholders, sustainability efforts are temporary at best, and damaging to progress at worst. Unfortunately, the work of sustainability officers to cultivate supporters, partners, and champions is often rushed or overlooked. The reality, however, is that recruiting people to our cause and keeping them focused is one of the most important things we can do. With appropriate engagement, people can provide access to decision-making authority, political capital, and financial resources. People will also ultimately validate whether behavior change initiatives--including those targeting reductions in energy, water, waste, or carbon--are successful (or not). A strong communications and engagement strategy is a fundamental tool to create lasting change. It will help identify your audience, craft thoughtful messages, and determine the right channels for delivery. It will move stakeholders along a continuum from awareness to advocacy, taking an intentional, audience-specific approach. A thoughtful, well developed communications strategy is both 'hooky' to get people interested and 'sticky' to keep them engaged over time. The presenter, a recovering sustainability officer who led the founding of sustainability initiatives at two institutions, will share 5 specific and actionable insights gained through his work since leaving roles higher education. In his work at a strategic communications and stakeholder engagement firm, he's learned a number of lessons serving clients in education, healthcare, government, non-profit, and corporate settings that can be applied in the higher education sustainability context. Attendees can expect to learn core principles of strategic communications, including key insights to identify and connect with individuals and groups.

2513,Award Winner Session: Demystifying Sustainability Behaviors on College and University Campuses,"Strategies that focus on influencing student and employee sustainability-related behaviors can play an important role in achieving campus sustainability and climate action goals. Although campus sustainability practitioners recognize the value of behavior change, the factors that influence sustainability behaviors are not always well understood. This presentation will summarize dissertation research comprised of three studies that provide insight into 1) behavior change intervention strategies included in campus climate action plans, 2) the factors that influence student and employee campus sustainability behaviors, and 3) the connection between campus sustainability engagement activities and operational sustainability performance. The presentation will focus on the practical implications of this research that help to increase our understanding of student and employee sustainability behaviors. The first study utilized content analysis methodology to examine a sample of college and university climate action plans (CAPs) to determine whether they include behavior change intervention strategies, what types of behavior change interventions are present in CAPs, and the types of sustainability behaviors that are targeted in CAPs. The second study examined the relationship between sustainability behaviors and several factors that influence those behaviors such as attitudes, social norms, and organizational climate for sustainability. This was examined by means of sustainability culture assessments conducted at six colleges and universities utilizing surveys of students and employees. The third study utilized data from the AASHE Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS) to examine the relationship between efforts to engage students and employees with sustainability and campus operational sustainability performance. The results suggest that a campus's efforts to engage the campus community with sustainability are strongly related to its performance in areas related to greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, commuting, waste minimization, sustainable food purchasing, and water use.",Onondaga Community College,3977,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"behavior change,student attitudes,climate action plans,student engagement",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,"Sean Vormwald, PhD",Director of Sustainability and EHS,Onondaga Community College,3977,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2337,Synergy with Residential Life and Sustainability,"Educating students about sustainability can be a challenge in higher education climates, whether it is due to short supply monetary resources or human labor. To overcome this challenge, the Office of Residential Life at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette has developed a committee of Resident Assistants (RA) who work with the Office of Sustainability to promote sustainability initiatives and practices to our on-campus student residents. The RA Sustainability committee was formalized in the Fall of 2018 by its designation in the University's Sustainability Strategic Plan as a strategy meant to help the University meet its objective of increasing sustainability awareness and participation across campus. The specific purpose of the committee, which meets monthly with the Office of Sustainability, is to help student residents assimilate to sustainable living on campus and in the community. The role of any RA is to create an environment that encourages social and academic development within a residence hall or on-campus apartment community. Their status as 'peers' as well as their frequent contact with students makes RAs the most efficient and impactful option for informing students and modeling behavior related to sustainable living habits. Our committee uses programming to educate on-campus residents about topics and behaviors related to sustainability. This teaches lessons and institutes habits that will benefit both the students and their communities once they leave campus. In its first formal year, the RA sustainability committee has: -Started a successful plastic bag collection and recycling program -Led community bike rides and trips to the local farmers market -Instituted the 'Cajuns Don't Waste Room Challenge' where rooms are scored on sustainable topics and given a green certification -Hosted 'Energy Week' (educating residents of sustainable living habits) -Conducted many LED light bulb exchanges",University of Louisiana at Lafayette,1617,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,Sustainability Office,Housing & Residence Life,"residence halls,on-campus collaboration",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Jonathan Brown,Area Coordinator,University of Louisiana at Lafayette,1617,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Brown_1382.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17421/1100_Brown_1382.pdf,,,,,,
2348,Balancing Effort With Productivity--Lessons Learned in Managing an Impactful Intern Program,"Whether you manage an established intern program or are faced with the daunting task of starting one from scratch, you have likely acknowledged the effort and time commitment it requires. Though these programs are intended to increase sustainability offices' capacity to impact change on campus, they also require that resources be dedicated to preparation of projects for student involvement, managing personnel and, in many cases, revising (and unfortunately even replicating) efforts. It can be discouraging to learn of programs that host large teams of students with no mention of the inherent management struggles that may derail a small staff from the achievement of its goals. In this presentation, the University of Mississippi Office of Sustainability offers insight and strategies for supporting an internship program that not only empowers student leaders but enhances your office's capacity in a meaningful way for both students and full-time staff. The University of Mississippi's Green Student Internship Program (affectionately referred to as GSIP) is now in its 10th year and has undergone several stages in its growth. Its current form utilizes an integrated approach and was developed based on a series of interviews with GSIP alumni and interns. This approach offers each intern a depth of experience in one area, with collaborative work on other projects, producing well-rounded, well-informed student sustainability leaders. Though sustainability and environmentalism are not widely embraced in campus culture, the program still attracts a large, diverse pool of talented student applicants each semester. These students contribute demonstrably to office goals, proving indispensable to the mission of the office. This presentation will provide a practical, goal-oriented approach to sustainability internship programs, complete with an honest discussion of the associated struggles, time-constraints, communication mishaps, and lessons learned from a decade of trial and error.",University of Mississippi,3578,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,,,,"internships,project based learning",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Kendall McDonald,Office of Sustainability,University of Mississippi,3578,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_McDonald_1472.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17453/1100_McDonald_1472.pdf,,,,,,
2089,Growing a Tree: Sustaining a Student Organization and Overcoming Barriers on Campus,"We are all on this mission to create more sustainable campuses, but we often overlook the importance of making sure our organizations are sustainable in themselves. This session will open with a case study on Sustain UNL, a Recognized Student Organization (RSO) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and how focusing on the structure and values of their organization reaped beautiful benefits. By integrating sustainability and the biology of trees into the creation of the 'Living Model,' Sustain UNL has created a visual that helps guide them overcome barriers and foster sustainability culture on campus. As the 'Living Model' is explored along the metaphor of a tree, we will uncover the keys to overcoming the barriers of being in a predominately conservative state, getting non-environmental majors involved, and how to avoid running into the same problems year after year. Students play a vital role in fostering sustainability culture on campuses, so we will focus on solutions to the common barriers students face and come together to find solutions to the barriers students have yet to overcome.",University of Nebraska - Lincoln,3610,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,,,,,,"challenges,student organizations,barriers",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Brittni McGuire,Student,University of Nebraska - Lincoln,3610,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1415_McGuire_1681.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16767/1415_McGuire_1681.pptx,,,,,,

In an effort to better understand the consortium's collective emissions impact; compare emissions estimation methodologies between schools; and consider how to decrease emissions on a broad scale, the Consortium's Data Working Group developed a process to answer these questions. Presenters from five different schools within the consortium will present this readily replicable process and key findings, which began by assessing each university's scope 1 and 2 emissions and then expanded into scope 3 topic areas, including air travel and waste. In addition to sharing best practices and key takeaways from the consortium's research into Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, this session will cover the consortium's approach and share best practices to enable other college and university collectives interested in assessing their impact. Following the brief presentation, the presenters will facilitate break-out groups on topics related to the presentation with the goal of attendees sharing their lessons-learned and future plans of sustainability alignment.

2476,Climate Resilience and Economic Development: Unlikely Bedfellows in a Small Community,"In 2018, Black Hills State University began a climate resiliency planning process for the campus and surrounding community of Spearfish, South Dakota (pop. 12,000). With the help of Verdis Group, they brought together a cross-sectoral task force, completed a community resilience assessment, and established goals and strategies to increase their resilience to the changing climate. The Spearfish area faces risks from warming temperatures, reduced snowpack, flooding, extreme precipitation events, wildfire and drought. Their Climate Resiliency Plan was completed in Spring 2019. One finding that surprised many was the importance of economic development as a key strategy to ensure the community's ability to thrive in a changing climate. Other factors that emerged were the multi-faceted benefits of the nearby forest; the importance of fostering a volunteer corps; the need for more child care options; and the importance of the university's nursing program. In this session, BHSU and Verdis Group will share with participants how they engaged in the climate resiliency planning process, what they learned, and how they plan to implement their strategies. They will describe their emerging model for doing climate resiliency planning, and share best practices for others who are interested in doing resiliency planning in their own communities.",Verdis Group,8491,Black Hills State University,0603,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Air & Climate,,,,,"resilience,community partnerships",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Kim Morrow,Senior Associate,Verdis Group,8491,Kathy Johnson,Vice President for Finance & Administration,Black Hills State University,0603,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Morrow_1670.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18113/0830_Morrow_1670.pdf,,,,,,
2461,What Good Looks Like: Creating a Center for Climate Resilience using the Living Community Challenge,"San Francisco State University is redefining what it means to be an environmentally and socially resilient research university. At its campus in Tiburon, CA, SF State is striving for Living Community Challenge certification as part of its master planning process. Romberg Tiburon Campus (RTC) is located on the San Francisco Bay, and much of the 55-acre campus is on a cove or on sloping, wooded hillsides. Currently, the educational focus is on estuary and ocean science. The campus is home to various aging historical and other buildings that will be negatively impacted by sea level rise, a situation that ties directly to the marine research conducted on site. The functional and financial challenges facing the Romberg Tiburon Campus necessitate an integrative and multidisciplinary strategy for redevelopment. The university community fully integrated the LCC framework, incorporating biophilic, regenerative, and resilient principles in its plan for the campus. In addition to sound physical planning and water and energy conservation measures, the LCC requires that campuses create environments that optimize equity, physical and psychological health, and wellbeing. As a result, the master planning process daylighted ways to use the site that may not have resulted from a more traditional approach, both functionally and programmatically. The planning process set the vision of creating a global, interdisciplinary center for climate science on the site, with the physical environment as a direct reflection of the necessary response to climate change. The master planning team worked with campus faculty members who specialize in biology, oceanography, anthropology, and marine research on developing meaningful solutions. The campus also engaged a community advisory group to find ways to tie the campus to the local community and find uses supportive of both groups. The panel and the presentation will cover a discussion on resilience and regenerative master planning on a campus",San Francisco State University,2757,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Buildings,,,,,"resilience,Living Community Challenge,building design",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Caitlin Steele,Administrator,San Francisco State University,2757,Nick Kordesch,Sustainability and Transportation Projects Manager,San Francisco State University,2757,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2046,Demonstrating the Return on Investment of Campus as a Living Lab: Case Studies From the Field,"Realizing the promise of campus and community as living laboratories for students can seem like the ultimate goal. Done well, these applied learning pathways offer significant returns to students, campus stakeholders, and community partners, while breaking down traditional barriers between academics and operations. While there is no single approach, this session will present four distinct yet successful approaches from a variety of California campuses: Skyline College and the San Mateo County Community College District foster opportunities for future, current, and post graduate students to practice what they learn by addressing real-world problems on campus. Peer to peer sustainability projects empower students and leverage faculty to inform classroom content and improve operational outcomes. Merced is helping to bring their LEED rated research campus to life through student internships that focus on energy efficiency, zero waste, and overall campus sustainability. At Orange Coast College, students helped to write and implement the campus' sustainability plan, coordinated out of the Ronnenberg Center for Environmental Sustainability, the first USGBC triple LEED Gold, SITES and TRUE Zero Waste certified facility. San Mateo County Community College District has realized significant returns to both district and campuses through technical energy savings projects that graduate Fellows have championed. At the core is a commitment to prepare the next generation of sustainability professionals to address the state's ambitious climate goals. Co-benefits from this approach include realizing environmental and cost savings for campuses. Presenters will discuss the positive returns on their efforts including advancing campus clean energy and sustainability, integrating cutting edge content and hands-on projects into curricula offerings; establishing industry and community connections; developing paid student work-experiences; and transforming their campus energy operation.",Strategic Energy Innovations,7850,Skyline College,4703,"University of California, Merced",2244,Orange Coast College,3979,San Mateo County Community College District Office,2881,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,,,"return on investment (ROI),Campus as a Living Lab Track,living labs",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Stephen Miller,Deputy Director,Strategic Energy Innovations,7850,Carina Anttila-Suarez,Professor,Skyline College,4703,Mark Maxwell,Director of Sustainability,"University of California, Merced",2244,Mike Carey,Sustainability Coordinator,Orange Coast College,3979,Isaac Knipfing,Utility & Sustainability Specialist,San Mateo County Community College District Office,2881,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Miller_1720.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16609/0915_Miller_1720.pdf,0915_Miller_1720.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16609/0915_Miller_1720.pptx,,,,
2027,"Blueprints for Breaking Silos: Pathways to Engage Faculty, Staff and Students in Campus Living Labs","Presenters will share pathways, frameworks, and methods for engaging diverse faculty, staff, and students in using the campus as a living laboratory through examples of impactful research collaborations from the University of British Columbia's SEEDS Sustainability Program, and University of Georgia's Office of Sustainability. The session will focus on campus-wide structures and pathways that invite faculty, staff, and students from many different departments to connect their disciplines to on-the-ground sustainability issues. These frameworks also ensure that the academic, research, operational and service missions of the university are mutually supportive and foster a culture of collaboration and hands-on learning. Examples of pathways for Campus as Living Lab projects will include: 1. Formalized academic and operational partnerships 2. Interdisciplinary multi-stakeholder hub models, and alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals 3. Alignment with official policy and plans 4. Partnerships with off-campus partners 5.

2186,"Arrive as Intern, Depart Further on the Path to Sustainabilista","What should sustainability interns know about sustainability, change agentry, and their capacities to lead change initiatives by the time they leave the internship? What can sustainability offices do to send interns on their way, enabled to apply and advocate for the ethics, principles, and practices of sustainability wherever their next steps take them? Operating under the assumption that interns should leave their experience more capable as sustainability practitioners, the Office of Sustainability at Auburn University created a curriculum for interns that identifies and cultivates their personal talents and strengths; teaches them foundational sustainability framing concepts; introduces them to an array of leadership and change agent frameworks, skills, and tools; and cultivates an understanding of the importance of strong process skills and the ability to nurture healthy group norms and culture.

2193,The State of Sustainability in Higher Ed: Managing to Make a Difference,"Managing a college or university sustainability program is a tough job under normal circumstances. But in the current era of political divisiveness and ideological extremes, sustainability issues and goals can be more contentious than ever among different stakeholders, adding a new set of occupational challenges. In view of these challenges, what are today's trends for how colleges, universities, and all of us, are managing sustainability in both operational and educational programs? How do those trends differ among institutions of different sizes and types? Or in red states vs. blue states? Given the lack of support from the federal government for sustainability issues in general, plus the usual long list of competing priorities faced by senior administrators everywhere, how can sustainability officers be resourceful in building strong programs? This panel will provide you with an overview about recent trends and developments affecting our profession, then some practical advice to help you maximize your effectiveness and make the most out of the current state of sustainability in higher ed. From our panel of experienced sustainability professionals, you'll get dos and don'ts with specific examples about how to: 1) Stay ahead of the curve; 2) how to select initiatives that demonstrate your value and strengthen your business case; 3) Set goals that are ambitious but achievable - be specific, measurable and mission-focused; 4) Make friends and influence people - strive for multi-stakeholder collaboration and engagement that expands your influence across the spectrum of sustainability issues; 5) Stay locked in and find creative solutions to trendy issues without losing your focus on strategic plans and goals; 6) Be resourceful - Identify and leverage internal and external resources and opportunities that can help you achieve results.",University of Connecticut,2131,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,4238,Stanford University,4127,Smith College,4705,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,"sustainability officers,challenges,state of sustainability",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Richard Miller,Sustainability Staff,University of Connecticut,2131,Cindy Shea,Sustainability Director,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,4238,Fahmida Bangert,"Director, Sustainability and Business Services (former AASHE chair)",Stanford University,4127,Dano Weisbord,Director of Sustainability and Campus Planning,Smith College,4705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Miller_1264_1031_151240.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17030/1100_Miller_1264_1031_151240.pdf,1100_Miller_1264.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17030/1100_Miller_1264.pdf,,,,
1985,From a Rating to Results: Strategies for Aligning Sustainability Goals with Campus Priorities,"Each institution has myriad opportunities for improving its environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Some are poised at the outset of a burgeoning discussion around sustainability while others have been long-committed to its principles. The STARS rating system provides a framework for schools to measure progress, communicate success, and identify areas for growth. With a range of possibilities and limited resources, prioritizing initiatives can be a challenge. Where do we begin? What are the next steps to take? How has STARS been leveraged to make change? Join us to understand how sustainability professionals at three diverse schools tackle these questions. Arizona State University, Clemson University, and the University of New Haven have all used STARS as one tool to identify priorities, engage the campus community, and share results with the broader public. And yet each unique institution will approach sustainability in a way that aligns with the individual campus mission. ASU is a four-time STARS Gold institution, typically rated within the top 10 schools. ASU founded the first School of Sustainability in the country and continues to drive to achieve climate positive and more. ASU will outline its team approach to STARS. Thomas Green Clemson founded Clemson University with the goal of building a sustainable economy. Today Clemson's Sustainability Commission is the coordinating body for efforts to become a model of sustainability. Having recently achieved a Silver rating on Clemson's first STARS report, next steps will focus on refining existing initiatives and implementing programmatic changes that surpass sustainability goals. The University of New Haven recently began its first STARS analysis. The new Office of Energy and Sustainability coordinates efforts to identify long and short-term solutions to reduce carbon footprint, protect the environment, and integrate sustainability into classes and co-curricular learning opportunities.",Arizona State University,4531,University of New Haven,4204,Clemson University,1682,Sightlines,2222,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,"STARS,priorities,sustainability reporting",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Corey Hawkey,Assistant Director,Arizona State University,4531,Laura Miller,Director of Energy and Sustainability,University of New Haven,4204,Jennifer Goree,Director of Healthy Campus and Sustainability Minor Instructor,Clemson University,1682,Kelly Marchione,Project Lead,Sightlines,2222,Shelly Giannini,Project Lead - Sustainability Specialist,Sightlines,2222,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Giannini_1269.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18369/1445_Giannini_1269.pptx,,,,,,

1986,Next Generation Sustainability Planning,"Like many peer institutions, Duke, Cornell, Princeton and Penn jumped on board the higher education sustainability train as early developers of ambitious campus climate and sustainability plans more than a decade ago. These plans were the foundation for many successful carbon reduction strategies and the start of integrating sustainability across the institutions. However, as the implications of global climate change grow even more perilous and incoming students push for disruptive change, how do static plans stand the test of time? This session will explore the evolution of broad campus sustainability planning at four different institutions that have all come to the conclusion that these plans must be iterative and responsive to the changing campus and world climate. As cities unto themselves, the impact of universities (positive and negative) is widespread and complex. Sustainability planning must be woven into institutional priorities to ensure success but how does a plan keep up with the times, engage diverse, evolving stakeholders and serve as a pillar for benchmarking success? How does an institution balance the desire for a clear roadmap for achieving its goals while still allowing room for flexibility or transformative opportunities? What is the most effective way to engage campus stakeholders while assuaging institutional fear of too much transparency? Join sustainability experts from four different universities to hear the lessons learned and pitfalls to avoid when navigating this complex dance. Discover the strategies they have used to adapt and advance their sustainability planning while still highlighting progress and value to the campus community. Let's brainstorm together how the next generation of sustainability planning is more about developing directional frameworks that stand the test of time, with action plans that are shorter term and expected to evolve and adapt through iterations.

2538,Green Events: A Student Intern Approach to Sustainable Campus Gatherings,"This informational session will provide attendees with an in-depth look at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Office of Sustainability Green Events Program. This program began in 2018 as a collaboration between the Office of Sustainability (OS) and the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies. Each April, the Nelson Institute hosts an Earth Day Conference with over 600 attendees; the 2018 collaboration sought to make this conference zero-waste. A small group of student interns took on this enormous challenge with great success: approximately 280 pounds of waste was composted or recycled to achieve a 96% diversion rate from the landfill. Inspired by this success, the Office of Sustainability launched the Green Events Program, an initiative in which student interns consult with event planners on campus and encourage efforts to make events more sustainable. This program incentivizes socially sustainable purchasing, low-carbon menus, waste management, and a variety of other practices. It is unique in several ways, one of which is its use of a Green Event Guide and a Green Event Checklist, both developed by the student intern team. The Guide is a comprehensive resource for event planners about best practices for sustainability in seven categories: Venue, Purchasing, Decor, Communications, Transportation, Food, and Waste. The Checklist can calculate a value for the event's sustainability, and it is uniquely formatted to avoid disadvantaging smaller events. Presenters at this session will discuss the structure of the Green Events Program, its development, and the challenges it has faced. Presenters also will suggest strategies for other green events programs and solicit feedback from attendees.",University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,Sustainability Office,,"events,internships,students,green events",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Hannah Kasun,Office of Sustainability Intern,University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,Ally Magnin,Student Intern,University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,Meg DiPoto,Green Events Intern,University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,Jason Gallup,Student Programs Director,University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_DiPoto_1685.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18422/1445_DiPoto_1685.pdf,,,,,,
2056,Sustainability 2.0: How the REFOCUS Method is Enabling AASHE Members to Lead Deeper Change,"Many institutions are entering a 'Sustainability 2.0' phase, where offices have been established for up to ten years and topics such as recycling, composting, Eco-Reps, active transportation, etc. have seen the ebbs and flows of success. Many of us are feeling like it's time to take campus sustainability to the next level by developing transformational programs that will establish sustainability as a strategic priority that is fully integrated into all facets of the institution. With this interest in mind, last year, eight members attended an AASHE workshop led by REFOCUS titled: Leading Deep Change in Higher Education. Of the group, four members decided to build on the learning experience by participating in a four month long REFOCUS Applied Peer Learning Program. The program was designed to enable the group to smartly apply the REFOCUS method through a combination of self-study, one-on-one coaching and peer learning workshops. The group that participated is now inspired to share about the experience with their peers, including how the program has impacted each individual's perspective, focus and approach to generating deeper change.

2039,Tools and Strategies for Successful Living Lab Projects,"The campus and surrounding community are rich with learning opportunities. Ideas and passion for sustainability efforts, particularly among students, abound. Yet, the tools by which to ensure projects align with organizational strategy, realize academic outcomes and adhere to operational standards are sparse. Creating and keeping sustainability initiatives on track and ensuring they feed into each other over time and through multiple changes is a challenge every institution faces. To initiate and sustain strong sustainability efforts, Macalester College, Tufts University and San Mateo County Community College District have built project platforms that help track projects, measure successes and keep sustainability efforts moving in the midst of constant institutional change. The result is powerful learning opportunities that serve the campus and the community in new and expanding ways. Representatives from these organizations will share their experience in building and maintaining tools that capture Campus as Lab opportunities. These tools include online databases, project portals and sustainability program outsourcing methods. Attendees will learn 1. How to incorporate projects into coursework, and 2. How to build institutional memory of those projects and allow students to build upon each other's work.

1918,Sustainability Reporting at Universities with Multiple Platforms,"With the addition of online students, many schools now have over 100,000 students spread across multiple platforms. While much has been said about the academics of these institutions, fewer sources document the role of sustainability at universities with dispersed student populations. In such universities, many of the typical metrics (i.e. carbon emissions, student engagement, etc.) are not easily applicable to online populations. For example, how should a university account for carbon emissions when 70% of their students are learning from home? This proposal will examine the challenges of using standard STARS and other metrics across a university's units. Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) includes the traditional college, online education, refugee education, and competency-based degree programs. Beginning with STARS reporting in 2018, SNHU began the journey of finding a solution that co-creates sustainable efforts across all 4 units. The challenge was that SNHU is made up of multiple units, people, and projects that work individually and collectively to help the university succeed. Content covered in this presentation will include a description of the unique aspects of multi-platform education and will suggest ways in which STARS credits can be earned from non-traditional sources. Challenges in Sustainability Reporting How should enrollment and curriculum be measured? How should energy usage be applied to online students? How can sustainability be incorporated into customizable programs? While universities with large non-campus students have drawbacks in the ability to provide face-to-face sustainability education, the dispersed nature of the student population creates opportunities to co-create new methods of teaching and measurement of sustainable outcomes. With several hundred thousand more enrollees in the upcoming years, determining appropriate metrics and materials will be essential to promoting sustainability worldwide.",Southern New Hampshire University,3886,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,"STARS,sustainability reporting,online learning",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Kevin Snyder,Faculty,Southern New Hampshire University,3886,Caitlin Jillson,Graduate Assistant for Sustainability,Southern New Hampshire University,3886,Sophia Koustas,Assistant Professor,Southern New Hampshire University,3886,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Snyder_1410.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16182/1400_Snyder_1410.pptx,,,,,,
2190,Utilizing STARS for Shared Language and Data-Focused Collaboration: A Replicable Model,"In order to make progress campuses must be able to benchmark themselves and utilize that data to make informed decisions. This becomes exponentially important when campuses across a university system are working together to advance sustainability efforts. STARS credits provide all campuses with a shared language on which to benchmark themselves. In addition, it provides a clear framework for encouraging change. The UMass System, consisting of 5 comprehensive campuses across Massachusetts, was able to utilize the STARS framework to standardize the data methodology collected across the campuses and within each individual one. The campuses collaborated to develop a series of benchmarks to support its university system's Sustainability Policy. These benchmarks largely consist of key credits reported to STARS. Prior to this standardization effort, data across the campuses was inconsistent and often unreliable. Since taking on this initiative, the campuses have been able to report data to the University's Board of Trustees that is consistent and accurate. Furthermore, careful effort was taken to ensure this reporting aligned closely with other required external reporting by each of the campuses, much of which does dovetail into STARS. Understanding the value STARS can provide campuses is critical for data sharing. We were able to develop a dashboard of data that can provide information at the campus level while tracking our progress for the University consistent with our policy. In this session we will introduce the replicable reporting structure developed by the UMass System and discuss potential opportunities and challenges for implementation of a similar reporting framework with the campuses or University systems present in the room.",University of Massachusetts Dartmouth,0648,University of Massachusetts Medical School,0675,University of Massachusetts Lowell,1729,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,"STARS,sustainability reporting",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Jamie Jacquart,Assistant Director of Campus Sustainability,University of Massachusetts Dartmouth,0648,Suzanne Wood,"Program Manager, Sustainability & Auxiliary Services",University of Massachusetts Medical School,0675,Ruairi O'Mahony,Director of Sustainability,University of Massachusetts Lowell,1729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Jacquart_1604.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17020/0915_Jacquart_1604.pptx,,,,,,
2096,"Sustainability ""Offices of One""","We all know that Sustainability Coordinators are amazingly talented and highly motivated. We can do anything, right? Well, the truth is that we cannot do EVERYTHING; and yet so many of us find ourselves working in Sustainability 'Offices of One.' Whether we work for a small college, a medium community college, or a huge research university, the scale of the challenges before us are so massive and the scope of sustainability concerns are so broad that it can seem laughable when our institutions hire just one person to make all the magic happen. Yet here we are and how can we make the best of it? Whether your title is 'Director,' 'Manager,' 'Facilitator,' 'Coordinator,' or something else entirely, this session is for you if your internal response is 'You mean me?!' when you hear someone on campus say 'Can't our Office of Sustainability handle that?' You may feel alone on campus, but you are not alone at AASHE and we want to pull together all of you rock-star Sustainable 'Offices of One' for some serious mutual support time. We'll take a moment to let off a little steam through humor about this ludicrous situation we find ourselves in, but then we will dive into constructive idea and resource sharing. We want to hear your tricks of the trade. What are your best practices when it comes to managing: 1) Perceptions and expectations; time; budgets (or lack thereof!); committees and meetings; students; projects; priorities; data and information; STARS and greenhouse gas emissions reporting; picking up the slack and plugging the holes we observe; personal sustainability - staying sane, work-life balance, and professional development?

2238,Advancing Campus Sustainability Through Strong Partnerships,"CSU Northridge has achieved remarkable success in advancing sustainability through strong partnerships across campus. Some projects that seem challenging to implement may simply require asking questions and framing ideas in the right way to get a 'yes' or to start the conversation to figure out how to work together toward achieving them. Building and cultivating relationships to be a supportive campus partner is an integral component to successfully institutionalize sustainability. Some of our successes include converting paper forms into electronic processes, seamlessly switching form non-recycled paper to recycled, composting 100% of campus green waste, and transitioning to compostable single-use items. This session will highlight how partnerships can be developed, how to frame ideas and questions appropriately, and how to cultivate relationships to build on successes and move forward after letdowns. This includes creating an inclusive campus culture that promotes diversity and collaboration, including potentially unlikely partners. We'll share creative solutions to 'problems' and discuss how university staff can work together to advance campus sustainability. Sometimes, it's surprising how easy it is to solve hard problems if common goals are established and communicated effectively.","California State University, Northridge",1248,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,"partnerships,on-campus collaboration",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Sarah Johnson,Sustainability Program Analyst,"California State University, Northridge",1248,Austin Eriksson,Director of Energy and Sustainability,"California State University, Northridge",1248,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Johnson_1297.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17161/1530_Johnson_1297.pdf,,,,,,
1922,"Developing Effective Collaboration Among Students, Staff and Faculty to Advance Sustainability","For sustainability efforts to truly make lasting change on our campuses, we need support from students, faculty and staff. Each of these groups holds different power and influence on the campus that can be used to advance sustainability. However, the natural silos that these groups fall into can make it difficult to bridge the gap and bring them together to work together on common goals. We will share the example of a small, liberal arts college that has tried to advance sustainability through the principle of shared governance. We will discuss three specific examples of how the model of shared governance and collaboration could be used on other campuses to effectively move sustainability efforts forward. First, the structure of the Office of Sustainability reflects the value of having involvement from all groups. The office is jointly overseen by a full-time staff member and a faculty member. Under their guidance, experienced students lead teams working on sustainability projects. This unique structure allows for flexibility in how to tackle different projects. For example, politically sensitive ideas might be best brought to the administration through faculty, while customer facing units, like Dining, might be most influenced by student-driven projects. Second, we have used the college's sustainability plan to align the work of our student teams with the college's overarching sustainability priorities while still allowing them the flexibility to design their own projects. Finally, we will share several examples of how faculty have been incorporated into sustainability projects and we will discuss how offices without a direct connection to faculty can find and cultivate faculty allies. Leveraging the strengths and positions of each group at the college in a collaborative way more effectively advances sustainability efforts and promotes greater community.",Connecticut College,2990,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,"governance,student engagement,staff engagement,on-campus collaboration",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Chad Jones,Faculty Director of Sustainability,Connecticut College,2990,Emma Brooks,Undergraduate Student,Connecticut College,2990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through Northern Michigan University's EcoReps program, six sub-components of successful diverse recruitment have been identified. These components include analyzing current demographics in the program and setting SMART goals in regard to diversity, emphasizing faculty buy-in, creating a balance between the three pillars, highlighting personal benefits, making sustainability relatable, and developing strong application materials. The second key component is a strong retention strategy to ensure prolonged engagement and participation. The sub-components of retention include empowering diverse programming, developing pillar-based committees, and setting clear expectations for participation, communication, and accountability measures. These strategies have been developed from the inception of NMU EcoReps program, two years ago.",Northern Michigan University,3209,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,"peer-to-peer,goal setting,eco-reps",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Sarah Head,Intern,Northern Michigan University,3209,Marissa Lindstrom,Selection and Recruitment Intern,Northern Michigan University,3209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1300_Head_1814.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16878/1300_Head_1814.pdf,,,,,,

The presentation will address the six key steps that are essential for creating strong student oriented projects/programs. Throughout the presentation, we will be openly sharing our successes and faults as current coordinators of a peer to peer sustainability program which actively supports student driven projects. We will discuss how to effectively establish a student group and recognize overarching objectives, longevity, commitment levels, and delegation of leadership and tasks. Following the formation of the group, we will discuss how to identify and utilize on-campus resources which will assist the group in reaching desired outcomes. We will inform the audience of potential and uncommon resources, as well as ways to create and encourage long-lasting relationships. The next few steps will describe how to actively plan and see through a project successfully while keeping students engaged and creating materials to pass on to future students. The final key step is crucial for creating a lasting impact made by the students as we discuss the importance of reflection and leaving room for improvement.

And, while SO's can have a unique and critical role in shaping the physical future of their campuses, finding the time, place, and partners to influence a sustainable direction is not straight-forward. Join two University of California Sustainability Directors with planning backgrounds in a discussion about strategies they are piloting or implementing to try to shape an environmentally sustainable campus for the future.

Medical centers produce unique waste from clinical areas and research labs that was addressed through our recycling program using green stations to allow sorting of recyclable materials. KUMC harnessed the available local market for materials and receives rebates on metal, paper, and cardboard generating a combined revenue and savings of over $35,000. Buildings on campus aging from 1924 to 2017 are receiving HVAC upgrades that reduce our energy and natural gas use to decrease utilities spending and greenhouse gas emissions. The most important and innovative part of our sustainability program has been engaging with our campus and surrounding community. KUMC is located in an urban setting where we work closely with the city and local organizations to promote sustainable transportation with buses, bikes, and rideshare. Diversity and inclusion and healthy communities are at the forefront of everything we do from free exercise courses to farmer's markets on KUMC campus to bring local fresh produce to our staff, students, and neighbors.

2317,Sustainable Campuses: Integrating Sustainability into Your Institution,"Colleges and universities can advance sustainability applications and student learning opportunities by taking an active role in sustainability initiatives that can provide on-campus benefits for improved curriculum and recruiting. This poster session will provide information about utilizing the Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Program (ACSP) framework on how to integrate sustainability throughout campuses and will be applicable to both public and private institutions. The program is focused on how campuses can achieve sustainability within their campus community. The ACSP helps institutions become great places to live, work, learn and play by using the three e's of sustainability to protect, conserve and enhance wildlife habitat, water conservation, energy use, and other resources while engaging the community and other partners. We will discuss establishing priorities and setting expectations within the broader context of sustainability, while also focusing on specific elements that are most applicable and important to the individual campus. Through award-winning environmental education, technical assistance, certification, and recognition, AI has facilitated the implementation of natural resource management practices on campuses that ensure land, water, wildlife, energy, and other natural resources are sustainably used and conserved. AI has enrolled over 3,000 properties in its certification programs including several college campuses. This approach to environmental management encourages continuous program improvement, ensures that sustainability officers engage the campus community in outreach and education activities that promote awareness about the importance of comprehensive sustainability planning.",Audubon International,7415,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Curriculum,,,,,project based learning,10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Jessica Latus,Director of Sustainable Community Programs,Audubon International,7415,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Latus_1221.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17368/1100_Latus_1221.pdf,,,,,,
2473,Sustainability Misconceptions in Higher Education: How AASHE STARS Reporting May Drive Innovation,"Institutions of Higher Education have the capacity and capability to become leaders in sustainability, and potential agents of change. Sustainability conversations have been occurring at colleges and universities over the last half century; however, the process of becoming a documented sustainable institution has not been yet been extensively researched. The purpose of this research is to identify and potentially remove obstacles for implementing sustainability initiatives on campuses. This case study examines the current incorporation and data collection of the AASHE STARS (Advancing Sustainability in Higher Education, Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System) reporting program at a medium-sized, primarily non-residential, Midwestern regional state university campus. This accreditation process has revealed bureaucratic, systemic, and communication obstacles, as well as misconceptions of faculty, staff, and students that smaller colleges are faced with while implementing and documenting sustainable programs which may improve the quality of life for the campus and local community. This poster will briefly discuss barriers that could deter sustainability implementation and reporting at these institutions, as well as providing examples as to why sustainability should be essential. Existing research suggests that a lack of involvement, such as by administration and other influential campus stakeholders, may contribute to misconceptions about sustainability within the campus community. This research will address the challenges commonly observed by (Velazquez, Munguia, and Sanchez, 2005), such as the lack of the following: awareness, interest, and involvement; funding organizational structure; support from university administrators; measurable performance indicators; clearly defined policies to promote sustainability on campus; standard definitions of concepts.",Indiana University Southeast,1351,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,"innovation,STARS,barriers",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Robin Frederick,Sustainability Assessment Intern,Indiana University Southeast,1351,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Frederick_1879.ppt,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18101/1100_Frederick_1879.ppt,,,,,,
2080,Co-Creating: More Than Just a Plan,"Instead of another long Climate Action Plan that no one typically reads (as we experienced with our 2010 and 2015 Climate Action Plans), when the time came to update our Climate Action Plan, Santa Clara University decided to innovate and create an approachable, people-oriented plan. Since a stand-alone plan does not have guaranteed engagement or implementation, we knew we needed a concise plan with clear goals and objectives, identified implementation leaders and deliverable timelines, and built-in tracking mechanisms both internally in our office and externally for the campus community. The Sustainability Strategic Plan builds upon past climate action plans and propels us forward with solutions that require the campus to innovate (while not creating vastly more work) and to feel capable to enact change. Our vision was to co-create a plan with key stakeholders across the university and to equally emphasize interactive components so that our campus community could partake in actions that directly contribute to the Plan's outlined goals and objectives. Through a year-long stakeholder-informed process, we created a Sustainability Strategic Plan suite--inspired by and drawn from AASHE's Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, and Rating System (STARS), the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and solutions identified by Project Drawdown. We will share the suite of components that make up this engaging and 'digestible' plan: 1) an engaging overview video 2) an online brief booklet with goals and objectives, 3) an implementation roadmap -- strategies have descriptors such as category, responsible party, fiscal year, and UN Goals, 4) a public dashboard with key performance indicators for tracking progress and milestones, 5) 'Playbooks' that display bite-sized actions for individuals to implement the Plan based on their role on campus and, 6) a badge-award system designed with community-based social marketing principles to incentivize and reward individual behavior change.",Santa Clara University,5444,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,"climate action plans,stakeholder engagement,sustainability plans,planning",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Cara Uy-Segal,Sustainability Manager,Santa Clara University,5444,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_UySegal_1635.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16731/0830_UySegal_1635.pdf,,,,,,

Unfortunately, larger universities can often duplicate efforts and fail to connect academic research into the best practices of facility operations. Forging this connection can be a complicated and large undertaking that requires understanding the needs of many stakeholders across many different departments. This session will explore how to integrate academic work into applied operations by discussing the components of a Living lab and the role of many stakeholders in the process; including a focus on a Campus as a Living Lab liaison, who can help to coordinate research, funding, and project opportunities. Unique local problems can create unique local case studies that can provide co-curricular opportunities that will enhance the students understanding of applied sustainability while at the same time pushing the sustainability needle at an institutional level.

National Association for College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) has encouraged investments in sustainable college campuses, and each year campuses add to a growing list of significant achievements ranging from converting energy sources to net zero energy buildings and more. Yet short term financial pressures on institutions often make it difficult to obtain funds for sustainability initiatives. Sustainability staff need to infiltrate the finance office to work to advance sustainability goals, and obtaining funding to achieve those goals. Brief examples of different campuses who improved their physical plant operations and increased investments in sustainability initiative. Note language of 'Total Cost of Ownership' (TCO), Return on Investment (ROI), Energy Savings Contracts (ESCOs) and other financing mechanisms to achieve success. Different processes and paths to achieving success will be presented. Evaluate your own campus leadership hierarchy to maneuver to the best possible solutions.

1945,Envisioning Higher Education for Sustainability AFTER the Sh*t Hits the Fan,"The purpose of this session is to engage the AASHE audience in a thought experiment aimed at identifying alternative strategic priorities for higher education sustainability programs. The starting point for the exercise is the overwhelming evidence presented in recent reports and books (IPCC Special Report, 4th National Climate Assessment, The Uninhabitable Earth, etc.). Based on this evidence, it is increasingly likely that in the near future there will be an incident or series of events that make it painfully clear to leaders of major institutions that our climate and sustainability challenges are not only real, but urgent and existential. The sh*t will have hit the fan. At that pivotal moment, higher education sustainability advocates will be called on to present their plans for rapidly transforming the purposes and practices of higher education to respond to the crisis. What will we have to offer besides STARS and climate and resilience plans? In other words, what comprehensive vision will we offer when it is no longer assumed that the purpose of higher education is to graduate young people who can compete and win in an unsustainable global economic system? What happens when sustainability shifts from being just another competing institutional priority and becomes the central mission of learning? Likewise, how do the results of this thought experiment change how we view our current programs and priorities? Ultimately, this session aims to encourage members of the AASHE community to raise our ambitions and begin seeing at least part of our work as envisioning and creating a higher education-in-waiting. After making the case for a more ambitious and strategic agenda for higher education sustainability initiatives, the balance of the session will be taken up with small groups working on the thought experiment, including consideration of how to begin moving our sustainability initiatives from margin to center BEFORE the sh*t hits the fan.",West Chester University of Pennsylvania,3773,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Curriculum,,,,,"vision,transformational,climate crisis,social change,planning",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Paul Morgan,Professor,West Chester University of Pennsylvania,3773,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Morgan_1633.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16248/1445_Morgan_1633.pptx,1445_Morgan_1633.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16249/1445_Morgan_1633.pdf,,,,
2025,STARS Reporting Assurance: Multiple Paths to Quality Data,"With the launch of STARS 2.2, the system for ensuring data quality in STARS reporting continues to evolve and mature. This session will consist of a brief traditional panel paired with a 'matchmaking' session for institutions that are interested in finding a peer reviewer. The panel will open with an introductory review of the different options available under STARS 2.2 for data quality: the PA 4 reporting assurance credit as well as the exemplary practice credit for external reviews. Incorporating the Intercampus collaboration Exemplary Practice credit will also be addressed. The requirements of each option will be explained along with how they fit into the STARS submission process. Next, the panelists will share how their individual institutions have implemented these options on their campuses.

1873,Starting from Scratch: Facilitation and Planning Tools for New Sustainability Officers,"Sustainability positions are often relatively new additions to higher education institutions, requiring immediate collaboration with internal stakeholders, and community and business partners. Deeply entrenched internal politics, shifting leadership, and changing internal champions can be confusing to navigate as an emerging sustainability officer. In this session Sustainability officers from Contra Costa Community College District and San Mateo Community College District help untangle these challenges using Backcasting; a planning tool used in the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development to quantify common desires and focus areas for creating community sustainability goals. Backcasting allowed the speakers and the stakeholders at their institutions to collectively envision and record what a sustainable version of their campus community could look like in 2030 and how it can directly link students with job opportunities with community partners. From there, the team plans backward from this desired future state. Most importantly, it empowered internal stakeholders and external partners to solicit input, communicate their desires, and ultimately catalyze a districtwide sustainability initiative while building valuable relationships. This has empowered district stakeholders to use a shared vernacular around specific sustainability initiatives on campus. This renewed sense of seriousness and strengthened collaborative spirit has increased student job placement in 'green collar jobs' and has strengthened college ties with local businesses. In this workshop, the presenters will share for 30 minutes how their position fits within their organization and what resources they had to begin and how they tapped into the expertise of sustainability officers at other Community College Districts and specialists at local organizations to inform and guide our sustainability strategy. The remainder of the time will be used as a collaborative workshop.",San Mateo County Community College District Office,2881,Contra Costa Community College District,8074,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Public Engagement,,,,,"sustainability officers,getting started",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Isaac Knipfing,Utility & Sustainability Specialist,San Mateo County Community College District Office,2881,Tracy Marcial,Energy & Sustainability Manager,Contra Costa Community College District,8074,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Knipfing_1194.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16049/0915_Knipfing_1194.pdf,0915_Knipfing_1194.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16051/0915_Knipfing_1194.pptx,0915_Marcial_1194.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16050/0915_Marcial_1194.pdf,0915_Marcial_1194_1031_172257.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16050/0915_Marcial_1194_1031_172257.pdf

2079,How to Measure Success of Sustainability Initiatives Without Traditional Data Sources,"Have you ever avoided or been turned away from a project because you cannot quantify the results? Or have you implemented initiatives but have no way of determining if they are successful? In this session, we welcome stakeholders who are struggling to track their results and those who have never used metrics to track their initiatives. Participants will learn about choosing appropriate metrics, as well as creating proxies and work-arounds for projects that do not have conventional means of data collection. We will discuss the importance of tracking performance and hear about Barnard College's experiences creating measures of success when conventional methods of data analysis were unavailable. We begin by discussing how we created simple proxies to determine the effectiveness of an organics collection program without data from the waste hauler. In addition, we then go through an in-depth approach to estimating the energy usage of a single building that is on a shared meter. Finally, we will break out into groups to think through issues participants are facing on their campuses.

1877,Easier Said Than Done: Developing a Replicable Framework for Implementing CAP's in Higher Ed,"When beginning to execute a Climate Action Plan it becomes apparent that there isn't a 'one-size-fits-all' solution or a readily available replicable framework. Having to create your own tools can be a challenge, but also an opportunity. Cal State East Bay and Cal State Northridge have accepted this challenge and will share their approach from the perspective of an institution in the first year of CAP implementation and a campus that is four years into the process, respectively. In this session, Cal State East Bay will share the processes and tools developed and utilized for implementing its CAP, as well as the challenges and barriers encountered along the way. How to leverage programs such as Google Drive, Tableau and Airtable to structure implementation processes, track progress, and organize the Climate Action Plan Implementation Task Force (CAP IT) will be shared. Replicable data tracking and reporting templates will be highlighted and participants will learn firsthand the steps taken to organize and motivate various campus stakeholders working in the first year of CAP implementation. Highlighting Cal State East Bay's Office of Procurement as a model, successes in furthering carbon neutrality initiatives through purchasing will be discussed, including data tracking; policy updates; web language; etc. Having published its Climate Action Plan in 2016, Cal State Northridge (CSUN) is now in year four of implementation. While each planning strategy involves its own unique mix of personnel, policies, procedures and infrastructure, a unified implementation framework has emerged as the most successful pathway to project actualization. Sustainability staff from CSUN will share how this implementation framework has been adapted to different types of projects to maximize chances of success, engage stakeholders and drive progress, and share insights on what institutional tools and structures are best suited for different aspects of CAP implementation.","California State University, East Bay",1221,"California State University, Northridge",1248,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Purchasing,,,,,"climate action plans,planning",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Jillian Buckholz,Director of Sustainability,"California State University, East Bay",1221,Nikhil Schneider,Energy and Sustainability Coordinator,"California State University, Northridge",1248,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Buckholz_1204.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16063/1400_Buckholz_1204.pdf,,,,,,
2187,Strategies for Engaging Students in Meeting Operational Sustainability Goals,"Many colleges and universities either have or strive to develop sustainability plans or goals that are implementable, while still allowing them to achieve their educational mission. At Dartmouth College, Middlebury College, and Harvard University, which all have sustainability plans or goals, students have played important roles in encouraging these institutions to carry out the goal-setting and execution processes; simultaneously, these institutions have worked to enable student learning as a part of these processes. At Dartmouth, students are engaged with the sustainability plan through student clubs, the Sustainability Office's internship programs, specifically the Sustainability Corps that focuses on facilitating the College's successful completion of its goals, and independent student activism and dedication. At Middlebury, the process has been highly collaborative amongst students, senior leadership and trustees. The success of their efforts and achievement of sustainability goals has been the result of a patient, constructive give and take process that often goes into the classroom and comes back to the board room and which has leveraged the education mission of the college. At Harvard, the Council of Student Sustainability Leaders serve as advisors and ambassadors for the University's sustainability vision and priorities. The Resource Efficiency Program bolsters these efforts as peer-to-peer educators that drive action through engagement events and campaigns. Harvard's Living Lab Initiative provides opportunities for students to work directly with faculty and staff to tackle global sustainability challenges by using the campus as a testbed. This session is unique because it will provide both case studies of the way in which multiple institutions have handled the educational opportunity provided by sustainability goal setting, planning, and execution with a synthesis of strategies for successes and lessons for avoiding pitfalls.",Middlebury College,0532,Dartmouth College,0788,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,"student engagement,goal setting,sustainability plans",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,John Byrne,"Director, Office of Sustainability Integration",Middlebury College,0532,Rosi Kerr,Sustainability Director,Dartmouth College,0788,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2188,Transition Campuses: Can Transition Towns Offer a Replicable Model?,"This presentation provides an overview of the recent Transition Town/Transition Movement (TM), both in the US and globally, and then reflects on the strengths and weaknesses of this model of sustainable development in regards to campuses preparing students to co-create a sustainable economy. TM emerged from the permaculture work of Rob Hopkins and seeks to move human communities from oil dependency to local resiliency, recognizing it is not a choice, but 'an inevitable direction for humanity' (Hopkins, 2008: 14). To date, very few campuses have viewed sustainability, or even sustainable economies, through a Transition lens. However, given the implications of this inevitable direction for higher education, the presentation will theoretically apply the key tenets of the TM to college campuses, looking for parallels, synergies, cross-overs, points of agreement, and points of disagreement. With this overview in place, participants will be asked to work in groups to reflect on the guiding goals of TM and if these goals can be applied to respective host campuses in the realms of curricula, procurement, and/or facilities operations. The presentation will end by evaluating if the goals, messaging, and vision of TM can be utilized in higher education settings in ways that are helpful and/or compelling for students, faculty/staff, and donors, or not. This will require an honest reflection on what motivates Transition networks: Peak Oil and climate change. Both of these will overdetermine in impactful ways the future of higher education, and thus student preparedness for a sustainable economy than is currently reflected in the daily operations of most campuses. Therefore the overall guiding goal for this presentation is to collaboratively engage in the questions: Can the vocabulary and vision of Transition help frame future aspects of higher education, given Peak Oil and climate change, and if so, in ways that help co-create a sustainable economy?",College of Charleston,5047,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Public Engagement,,,,,"transition towns,planning,goal setting",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Todd LeVasseur,"Director, Sustainability Literacy Institute",College of Charleston,5047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_LeVasseur_1423.ppt,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17012/0830_LeVasseur_1423.ppt,,,,,,

2441,Grading practices of international instructors at research universities,"This project contributes to the literature on diversity management at universities through the examination of differences in grading practices between international and domestic instructors. Like incoming international students, international instructors also face challenges integrating into the U.S. academic environment, which is governed in part by norms and tacit knowledge. Guided by theories of assimilation, this work aims to understand how cultural distance between international instructors' home countries and the United States affect a critical yet malleable aspect of their job duties: grading practices. Using a novel, uniquely constructed data set of 2,789 randomly selected instructors who taught at least one undergraduate course from 2011 to 2018 at one of three major public research universities, I show that on average, international instructors assign grades that are 0.15 points lower than domestic instructors on a 4-point scale (this is about 32 percent of a standard deviation of class-average grades). After conditioning on instructors' academic backgrounds and qualifications, classroom characteristics, and (most importantly) academic department fixed effects, the grade gap decreases to 0.07 grade points but is still educationally and statistically significant. Regarding assimilation behavior, I find no evidence that international instructors grading practices converge toward those of their domestic colleagues as their careers progress, and if anything there is some evidence of divergence. Such knowledge will help administrators at universities and academic departments to design better diversity and inclusion policies.",University of Missouri,3593,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,international,10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Trang Pham,Doctoral Candidate,University of Missouri,3593,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Pham_1863.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17934/1530_Pham_1863.pdf,,,,,,

It combines a series of steps to help program designers, faculty members, sustainability coordinators, facilities professionals, buildings staff or any other member of university community, improve designs and overall outcomes. Though used extensively in Fortune 500 companies, and increasingly at non-profits, Design Thinking is not a tool that is leveraged at many universities and colleges. Participants in this session will learn about the key elements of design thinking, hear examples of applications of design thinking and will walk away with tools that they can use in their sustainability work.

2435,Co-Creating a Sustainable Economy Through Climate Adaptation Strategies,"This session will provide the audience applicable lessons and ideas on how to integrate learning opportunities of a sustainable economy into the curriculum. While informing and inspiring attendees on cutting edge and innovative solutions that are being developed to address some of the significant challenges pertinent to sustainability, the session will exemplify how higher education can best prepare students for success in a sustainable economy and how higher education can catalyze a sustainable economy through teaching. Climate change mitigation and subsequent implications on our dysfunctional economic system remains a critically important topic. However, solutions to sustainability challenges grounded in adaptation mechanisms have created significant economic opportunities and alternative economic models such as Solinc East Africa Limited that aims to involve women in all aspects of renewable energy to ASA in Bangladesh whose vision is to establish a poverty free society. From building floating communities in Amsterdam to the world's first commercial plant for capturing Carbon Dioxide directly from the air in Switzerland that uses the gas to help grow vegetables, these strategies provide contextual based economic opportunities to reshape our economic system. Many of these projects represent world's first efforts and contributions toward a circular and sustainable economy. As these initiatives take shape, higher education has a critical role to play in educating students about these initiatives and the challenges that must be addressed. Based on climate adaptation strategies identified by the students of the SEE 250 (Introduction to Sustainability, Energy, and the Environment) class at the University of Dayton over five semesters, this session would exemplify the opportunities to reshape our economic system while addressing five challenges pertinent to sustainability: seal level rise, deforestation, using carbon, food production, and fresh water scarcity.",University of Dayton,2170,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Air & Climate,,,,,climate adaptation,10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Felix Fernando,Lecturer,University of Dayton,2170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1963,"Learn to Lead the World Climate Simulation, a Mock UN Climate Negotiation","Learn to lead a World Climate Simulation - a mock United Nations (UN) climate negotiation meeting - on your campus or community. As a facilitator for the World Climate Simulation, you will give your future participants a transformative experience of the challenge of reaching global agreement to keep temperatures below a 2 degrees Celsius increase. By stepping into the shoes of world leaders in this role-playing experience, your participants will want to get more involved in climate change science and global politics. This simulation is an increasingly popular way to demonstrate the complexity of global climate action and has involved over 50,000 people in more than 80 countries, with events in many languages and settings. The events work well for groups from 10 to 100, with time commitments as short as two hours or as long as a semester. Participants with any level of prior knowledge can play the role of negotiators in a close-to-realistic 'Conference of the Parties' (COP) session of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Social justice is central to the World Climate Simulation. Participants grapple with global differences in responsibility for past emissions and very different levels of vulnerability to climate change impacts. The simulation's briefing papers prepare participants to represent their assigned nation or interest group accurately, in accordance with real geopolitical, economic and cultural differences. In the negotiation and reflection afterward, discussion of inequity, poverty, economic needs and trade-offs will be sparked, and participants will better understand sustainable development. Fundamental questions of who holds power, both within and between countries and blocs, will arise.

2036,Institutionalizing Sustainability Literacy: Leveraging Opportunities for Sustainable Development,"Creating leveraging opportunities for institutionalizing sustainability is a pervasive issue for institutions of higher education. This presentation will discuss various potential barriers encountered at the College of Charleston and how opportunities were leveraged to institutionalize sustainability as a foundational pillar of the institution. CofC represents a powerful case study as it has emerged from not even recycling in 2009 to a newly created Center for Sustainability that houses an Office of Sustainability (OOS) as well as the Sustainability Literacy Institute (SLI). It is a unified and integrated approach to building sustainability within student, academic and operational life of the campus. The primary focus will be on the Quality Enhancement Program (QEP), 'Sustainability Literacy as a Bridge to Addressing 21st Century Problems' that was developed using the Sustainability Action Plan (SAP) as part of its reaccreditation process. The QEP, as a foundational academic program of the SAP, is a multi-dimensional, multi-stakeholder project devoted to building sustainability literacy and to establish bridges with the OOS to reach every aspect of campus life. The project is based on five goals with seven learning outcomes that are strategically aligned to provide students with the skills and knowledge to be competitive for jobs in the sustainable economy with a distinct path toward addressing the complex problems of the 21st Century. Two years of data from the QEP will be shared providing insight into the successes and remaining challenges in building student competencies. Finally, the unexpected outcomes from this process will be presented -- including building safe and creative spaces, igniting the consciousness of the campus, and facilitating a shared institutional vision.",College of Charleston,5047,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"sustainability literacy,competencies",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,P.

1955,Advancing University Sustainability via a Co-Creative Process of Assessing Barriers & Change Drivers,"Higher education institutions increasingly aim to integrate sustainability at all levels including students, faculty, staff, and the larger community. However, universities also face barriers to enacting change towards greater sustainability, and these barriers exist in multiple dimensions (i.e. awareness, structure, and resources). A change management process can precisely characterize barriers and ways to overcome them. At Kennesaw State University (KSU), a faculty group representing six colleges used a process model to identify and assess barriers to academic sustainability as well as change drivers that remain effective during periods of institutional change and leadership turnover. Building on existing frameworks, we designed a five-phase process model that can help institutions identify barriers of varying difficulty and, subsequently, analyze which change drivers can have the most impact. At KSU, the process model revealed the significance and complexity of our barriers. For example, half were of high significance and six out of ten had components in all three dimensions. In response to these barriers, we found that the self-determination of middle-tier change drivers is currently the most available dimension of empowerment and a promising way to advance sustainability. In other words, we discovered actions that members of the existing KSU sustainability community may successfully undertake despite limited resources and authority. The model can be a tool for faculty and staff to co-create education for sustainability at their institutions because it can be applied repeatedly over time or modified to fit most any context.",Kennesaw State University,3848,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,"barriers,change management",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Elizabeth Giddens,Professor of English,Kennesaw State University,3848,Maria Kalamas Hedden,"Professor, Marketing and Professional Sales",Kennesaw State University,3848,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2546,Growing Strong Leaders: A Collaborative Approach,"Sustainability problems are intersectional and multi-faceted. Solving these problems will require collaboration between stakeholders working in different sectors and communities, and using different strategies. Our approach to training changemakers and creating sustainability programming must be therefore viewed through an intersectional lens. Thankfully, there are lot of awesome offices at Dartmouth College with different expertise that are training students to solve these problems. As a result, our mission is being accomplished in these offices as well. How do we support and collaborate with these offices in order to achieve our collective mission of producing a diverse and outstanding cohort of future changemakers? Our first step is to identify the core competencies that we want students to develop to be successful leaders. Then, we create relationships across our institution to learn about where and how other offices are teaching these competencies. Once we identify the offices where students are learning these proficiencies, we build relationships based on our mutual goal of creating positive-impact changemakers. Instead of competing to create programs that are better than those found elsewhere on campus, we set out to create programs of equal value, which allows us to carry out our mission in the Dartmouth Sustainability Office and other offices on campus. In return, we carry out the mission of our partners. We are able to honor the learning that students do in different corners of campus. As these partnerships and programs develop, we assess how we, as a sustainability office and as a collective campus, are building the best changemakers possible. This teaches students how to collaborate and support one another both during and after college. In this session, we will share this approach, tools for building relationships and developing shared program learning outcomes, and assessing student growth across departments and different leadership programs.",Dartmouth College,0788,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,"learning outcomes,student leadership",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Rosi Kerr,Sustainability Director,Dartmouth College,0788,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1996,Catalyzing Careers in Sustainability: Benefits of Community Engaged Course Design,"As Nathan Hensley of Bowling Green State University described in the March 24, 2017 issue of The Journal of Sustainability Education, sustainability education should be based on 'transformative, experiential, and place-based approaches' that 'enables students to become better citizens and stronger problem solvers.' This session will explore how these approaches prepare students for success in a sustainable economy, and how community engaged approaches to teaching can help catalyze a sustainable economy. Studying sustainability theories and practices is important, but classroom study alone will not prepare students to succeed in the field. Structured effectively, community engaged coursework benefits students, the institution, and the community. This session will share a case study of how community engaged coursework both engaged students in real world, transformative, experiential, and place-based approaches and fostered sustainable changes in local economic practices. It will focus on how a graduate sustainability course assignment shifted from a theoretical problem solving activity to a similar project with a local business. The result provided students with the ability to understand the breadth and depth of approaches to put sustainability initiatives into practice, and altered the business's approach to their operational plans. The impact of the case study will show how community-based coursework positively impacted the business and expanded students' employment opportunities in the field. The evidence of the community-based assignment's success is the placement of a student, within months of the final course presentation, into an internship, and how the project has shifted the business's planning and implementation of sustainability initiatives.

1916,"Preparing Students for Success Through Sustainability Competencies, Community and Hope","As sustainability educators we need to prepare students to address the challenges of sustainability in every field and for positions that have not even been developed yet. In addition to the disciplinary depth they gain in their primary area of study, we have developed a number of innovative programs that focus on leadership, interdisciplinary collaboration and sustainability competencies (as defined by the UN) which can be applied to any field. These programs are unique in that they focus on the development of communities of practice both pre and post graduation and empowerment through the cultivation of hope. Presenters will provide examples from multiple programs at the University of Georgia that prepare students for success in a sustainable economy including the Sustainability Certificate, the OoS sustainability internship program and topical engagement models such as Watershed UGA and Foodshed UGA. We will explore the results of an in-depth case study on the impact of interdisciplinary sustainability education and how community-based pedagogy relates to identity, belonging, and hope among undergraduate students. We will also highlight strategies developed through ongoing assessment, share initial data on the reach of these programs, and provide best practices that can be adapted to other campuses. We will then open up to conversation where audience members can share successes and failures to learn from each other.

1956,Ripon College Catalyst: Sustainable Futures Through General Curriculum,"Higher education will play an important role in equipping students with knowledge and competencies to address environmental and social problems as well as preparing them for civic engagement and the rapidly changing labor market in the 21st century. Ripon College, a small Liberal Arts institution in the Midwest, recently reformed its general education curriculum to promote skills such as critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, communication, intercultural competence, and collaboration. The signature Catalyst Curriculum consists of a five-course series culminating in an Applied Innovation Seminar. In this seminar, interdisciplinary teams of students work with faculty mentors to creatively address selected challenges inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In our first iteration of this seminar in Spring 2019, these challenges include climate change, mental health, water pollution, food security, and inequality. At the end of each semester, student teams share their work in an all-college celebration titled 'Catalyst Day', thus further raising awareness of sustainability challenges and potential solutions in our community. The Applied Innovation Seminar represents a high impact educational practice that nurtures specific competencies for promoting sustainable futures through careers and activism. This presentation, therefore, offers an overview of a unique program that combines goals of sustainability and general curriculum. The presentation will review the process of creating this curriculum through collaboration between faculty and administration and the learning objectives and content of this curriculum. Further, this presentation will discuss how this seminar supports student knowledge and competencies to address sustainability challenges with evidence drawn from its first semester in Spring 2019. At the end, I will offer a discussion of lessons learned as well as paths forward.",Ripon College,1241,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,,"general education,Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Alice Reznickova,Director of Sustainability,Ripon College,1241,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1962,Sustainability Curriculum: Status Quo or Transformation?,"In the last several years, we have witnessed a growing number of sustainability undergraduate programs across the United States. Often stemming from the work of existing departments, these programs address the need to integrate undergraduate students' knowledge of environmental and social problems with specific competencies needed to address them. While working to propose an innovative sustainability curriculum at my home institution, I set out on the quest to review existing interdisciplinary Sustainability Studies programs at institutions of higher learning across the United States. Overall, I analyzed the coursework of 65 college and university Sustainability Studies (or equivalent) majors to learn more about what sustainability as a discipline means. In general, there are very few similarities among the programs as they differ in the number of core and elective courses and disciplines that contribute to the major. At the same time, many appear to broadly define sustainability as the triple bottom line. Furthermore, I find that many programs lack integrative sustainability experiences, are structured similarly to interdisciplinary environmental studies programs, and heavily focus on pre-existing general or environmentally-focused courses. While the number of existing programs is evidence of institutional and faculty commitment to sustainability, it may also be a missed opportunity. This presentation thus calls for collaborations in defining sustainability as a discipline and innovation in course design and teaching techniques. This may be challenging given numerous institutional barriers; however, sustainability also presents an opportunity to provide transformative, cutting edge educational experiences to our students.",Ripon College,1241,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,"degree programs,interdisciplinarity",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Alice Reznickova,Director of Sustainability,Ripon College,1241,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2002,Learning to Change the Game: What Should Management Education for Sustainability Look Like?,"Sustainability requires business to radically reimagine how to keep the lights on, put food on the table, and provide housing, transportation, and education for a population that is headed for ten billion. Most undergraduate and graduate management programs are addressing the topic of social responsibility at the level of a bolt-on class or two, yet curricula are still largely single-bottom line oriented. How can business education rapidly transition to support graduates to build businesses, or transform existing businesses, to a focus on sustainability? How do we teach how to build organizations that are in business to solve social and environmental problems, while still achieving financial success? This panel will address three critical verticals that management education must embrace: Sustainability Vision; Leadership; and Business Execution in the service of the strategic vision. Beyond this, the panel will also explore core competencies, grounded in a discussion of Bard's MBA Toolkit, an assessment of a practitioner designed curriculum against leading competency models from the International Society of Sustainability Professionals and Harvard Business School. The panel will also address how these core business skills are critical to the work of sustainability professionals seeking to drive change in higher education.",Swarthmore College,3879,Bard College,3514,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Research,Research,"Business, Management, & Finance",,,management education,10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Aurora Winslade,Director of Sustainability,Swarthmore College,3879,Eban Goodstein,"Director, Bard Graduate Programs in Sustainability",Bard College,3514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2356,Breaking the Silos: Increasing the awareness and adoption of Green Chemistry across disciplines,"Green chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that use and generate less hazardous materials. In practice, green chemistry can result in tremendous benefits such as the reduction of hazardous waste, reduction in use of hazardous chemicals, reduction in purchasing costs, and increasing the energy efficiency of laboratory practices. The field of green chemistry has grown significantly over the past two decades and has remained somewhat separate from campus sustainability initiatives. In reality, the principles and practice of green chemistry can be applied across disciplines and solutions to sustainability challenges will ultimately require multidisciplinary approaches. This presentation will provide an overview of Green Chemistry and how it can be applied in disciplines and courses beyond the sciences, such as art, business, communications, economics, and more. Specific examples include how governmental programs such as the U.S. EPA's Safer Choice, a certification used in Environmental Preferable Purchasing, can be used to showcase greener chemical products in courses (i.e., chemistry and communications), as well as in student club activities. Green chemistry applied to art courses will also be presented as a model for reducing impacts in courses and programs beyond the chemistry course and lab. The use of chemicals on campuses and in courses is not limited to chemistry courses and programs and even reaches us in our daily lives at home. Green chemistry can have significant benefits when applied across disciplines, helping to reduce impacts and hazards.",Beyond Benign,7596,State of Washington,9521,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,,"green chemistry,chemistry",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Irv Levy,"Director, Green Chemistry Commitment",Beyond Benign,7596,Saskia van Bergen,"Green Chemistry Scientist, Department of Ecology",State of Washington,9521,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_vanBergen_1526.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17475/1100_vanBergen_1526.pdf,,,,,,
1999,"Narratives of relatedness: Engaging metaphor, story, and contemplative practices for economic change","The current dominant economy is rooted in patterns of extraction, destruction, scarcity, and disconnection with the living earth. These capitalist patterns have shaped our dominant culture, institutions, and our ways of being including how we relate to each other and the earth. At the root of our economy and dominant narrative is the belief in our separateness, and our forgetfulness or ignorance of our sacred interconnectedness. While we often long for change, we mostly do not work with others in ways that critically question our underlying economic patterns, or provoke the deep relatedness necessary for vibrant solutions. As we seek to imagine new economic realities, we must cultivate the skills of uncovering destructive cultural norms while also becoming skilled in narratives and ways of being that allow us to live in direct relationship and reconnection with each other and the living earth. Rooted in the philosophies of spiritual ecology, deep ecology, and critical theory, this session will explore how we can develop attitudes, skills, and patterns of critical consciousness and deep relatedness in higher education settings, and how these practices can support the creation of new economic realities. In particular, we will actively engage metaphor, story, and mindful contemplative practices to examine cultural norms and to re-engage narratives of relatedness and reciprocity. In doing so, we will collaboratively consider what these cultural shifts could look like in our day-to-day work with others, and how they could support new economic realities.",Portland State University,2515,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,,"communications,telling stories",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Heather Burns,Associate Professor,Portland State University,2515,Amie Riley,Leadership for Sustainability Education Program,Portland State University,2515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1944,Building Social Cooperation and Mutual Support Competencies in Agroecology Education,"Farming in a restorative and regenerative economy will require cooperative mutual support networks and skills that have not been the hallmark of commodified agriculture in the 20th and 21st centuries. Capitalist economies and modern societies select against such structures and skills, and an education institution serving modern corporate capitalism also emphasizes individualism and self-reliance while producing a significant amount of alienation. Beginning farmers face substantial obstacles and significant physical and emotional stress. Burnout rates are high. Similarly, large scale commodity farmers face tremendous financial and psychological insecurities from capricious economic cycles, and despite government support programs continue to dwindle in number, while those remaining become larger and more corporate in structure-one factor that has led subsequent generations toward alternative models. Insights from indigenous cultures as well as peasant communities and contemporary food sovereignty movements can provide guidance and inspiration for building social cooperation and mutual support into courses and programs. Experiential learning curricula such as agroecology programs emphasizing practical application of principles on campus farms can provide a context in which these competencies can be incorporated and mastered, thus preparing beginning and renewing farmers not only to survive the alienating, predatory economy of the present, but also to help build the restorative and regenerative economy of the future. Attendees will be encouraged to share their own experience in building these competencies in formal and informal curricula.",Johnson County Community College,2128,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,Agriculture,,,"agroecology,competencies",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Stu Shafer,Professor,Johnson County Community College,2128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Shafer_1631.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16246/1400_Shafer_1631.pptx,,,,,,
2045,Developing Interdisciplinary Sustainability Programs at Small Liberal Arts Colleges,"With undergraduate enrollment ranging from under 450 to 2,500 and total full-time faculty sizes from 40 to 150, small liberal arts colleges experience a number of challenges to implementing major programs focused on sustainability education. However, opportunities exist to leverage smaller size with an institutional mission in the development of innovative, interdisciplinary sustainability majors and minors. Among the challenges are a lack of technical expertise in areas such as engineering and agriculture, limited resources preventing the addition of new faculty to support such majors, and a lack of understanding of the broad concept sustainability among faculty from disparate disciplines. The latter often results in a false sense of competing interests among well developed institutional diversity and inclusion priorities, and those of sustainability education. Advantages include greater opportunities for interdepartmental interaction; the development of new, relevant courses in departments across the curriculum to address reduced enrollments; increased cross-talk among operations, administrative, and faculty stakeholders; smaller class sizes that allow for more hands-on problem solving pedagogies and opportunities to develop essential interpersonal competence; and unified commitments to integrative learning that are central to both liberal arts and sustainability education. Here, we present the development of two such majors at smaller schools emphasizing specific ways these advantages were used to support that development within the context of the current conversation about sustainability competencies, and principles and practices emphasized in AASHE Sustainability Across the Curriculum Workshops. The panel will present strategies we have pursued to engage our colleagues to support and participate in our new programs, and to gain the administrative support for them during times of financial exigency and programmatic competition for limited resources.",Muhlenberg College,3697,Eureka College,4079,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,,,,,"liberal arts colleges,degree programs,interdisciplinarity",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Richard Niesenbaum,Professor and Director of Sustainability Studies,Muhlenberg College,3697,Katy Everett,Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies,Eureka College,4079,Kalyna Procyk,Sustainability Coordinator,Muhlenberg College,3697,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Procyk_1719.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16607/0915_Procyk_1719.pptx,,,,,,
2500,Award Winner Session: Food Waste Digester Project: An Ongoing Collaborative Project Model for Experiential Student Learning,"This presentation will focus on The CGCC Food Waste Recycling Project, a grant-funded campus-wide ongoing collaborative project that offers deep, cross-disciplinary, experiential student learning via an innovative solution for CGCC's food and green waste. With the support of campus facilities, this program has established a receptacle system that facilitates separation of food waste generated on campus. A collaborative group of biology and engineering students, with guidance from faculty, have designed a unique organic waste digester machine that will recycle food and green waste into a nutrient-rich liquid fertilizer, which will be used to maintain campus grounds. During this time, students will be studying the effects of this liquid fertilizer on plant life. The long-term goal is for this model to be used throughout the Maricopa Community College District and for this fertilizer to be disseminated to our surrounding agricultural community with city partnerships established by students. Through collaborative biology, art, English, and communications projects, students have begun a marketing campaign that promotes a 'sustainability mindset' by changing the behavior of how our campus community handles their waste through increasing awareness of what happens to our food after we dispose of it. In this discussion, we will examine how CGCC students play an integral role throughout this project, which offers a unique opportunity to practice translational science, bringing innovative ideas to the public while fostering critical thinking and confidence in their innovative potential.",Chandler-Gilbert Community College,6010,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Campus Engagement,Waste,,,,"AASHE Award Winner,food waste,experiential learning,biodigesters",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Mickey Marsee,Faculty,Chandler-Gilbert Community College,6010,Miriam Kleinman,Faculty,Chandler-Gilbert Community College,6010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Kleinman_1909.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18240/1400_Kleinman_1909.pptx,,,,,,

1997,"What do Students Know, Think, Feel, and do about Sustainability and Climate Change?","This session describes three separate but coordinated projects within the University of Hawaii System: a survey, a focus group study, and an assessment pilot project. Moderated for synthesis, each panelist will describe their study: 'Earth Day Survey: a Qualitative Open-Ended Survey': flagship campus Results from 1652 respondents show that 95% of the campus community are concerned about sustainability and climate change issues, and the three issues people concerned the most are: global warming, ocean and beach, and consumer culture. Sustainability and climate change issues have changed people's choices and decisions in various aspects, from daily choices like choices of purchasing, transportation, food, and recycling, to major decisions on academic programs, research projects, career, employer, political decisions, financial investment, and place to live or retire. 'Worry and Hope: Student Focus Groups': systemwide study 20 focus groups conducted across eight campuses in with over 200 students reveal a pervasive emotional atmosphere of fear, anger, and sadness. Students respond in an atmosphere of trust, passion, and values from the faculty. Multiple courses enhance efficacy and co-curricular experiences create a sense of efficacy that carries into the classroom. 'KapiÊ»olani Research Scholars: SALG, Sulitest, and Rubric for Sustainability Learning Outcomes': one community college campus In a pre and post-test administered in Sustainability-Focused classes in English, Botany, Biology, Economics, and Pacific Island Studies, at the beginning of semester 39% of students were interested in a major related to sustainability; at the end, 69.8% were interested in majoring in a sustainability area.

Tools for this rebuilding of the commons include: Intentional practices of gratitude, mindfulness, crafting the resistance, sharing economies, relearning old skills, (taught inter-generationally) commensality, and accessing older agrarian and environmental rhythms of time; a slowing down and focus on 'kairos' rather than chronological time to access wisdom from the sentient environment. We also explore the idea of the epistemology of joy. All courses include the exploration of commensality. We break bread and discuss readings together at the end of each class. Community. Communion. Companion (one with whom you break bread). Courses are place-based and utilize the Antioch Farm and environs. Each course is based on ideas of democratic education and differentiated learning and incorporate peer-to-peer teaching. Examples of skills that students have taught each other include spinning, salt tanning of a hide of a sheep from the Antioch Farm, making cordage from wood nettle, slippery elm cough syrup, acorn bread, knitting, walnut ink, goat-milking, foraging, and harvesting and making dandelion tea.

2545,Vesting Faculty to Make an Impact: In-House Training for Sustainability & Climate Consequence,"The pathway to empowering students with knowledge of sustainability, climate resiliency, and climate adaptation begins with passionate, knowledgeable faculty embedding these concepts into classes across the curriculum, service learning, study abroad, and independent study. This knowledge must extend beyond those students specifically seeking degrees in sustainability studies to all students in all fields of study. To be responsible citizens and future leaders, students in all programs must understand how their chosen career will affect the health of the physical, social and economic environment. Nevertheless, even the most highly educated and experienced faculty may not be equipped with degrees or a specific background in sustainability. Despite a passion for education, they often lack the base of knowledge to embed sustainability or climate concerns into their classes and to guide students in an appreciation of the cross-disciplinary nature of sustainability. This session focuses on developing your own in-house training for faculty who would like to introduce or enhance the level of sustainability and climate consequence in their courses and to explain the interrelationship of environmental, social and economic issues as it pertains to their field of study.

The 17 SDGs provide endless material for work in all four language skill areas: reading, writing, speaking, and listening. By studying the 17 SDGs, students learn about current world issues and attempt to understand their causes. How did we get to where we are in 2019? What does the future hold? What will our world be like in 2030? Will we achieve these goals? The SDGs take English language students out of the grammar textbook and into the real world, forcing them to consider the implications of government actions and policies, institutionalized inequality, and societal systems. In order to fully explore such weighty topics, students are pushed to expand their vocabulary and grammar in English. On the other hand, even the lowest level beginners can grasp these fundamental issues thanks to the clear graphical symbols for each goal. They can start to make their own personal connection to the goals that are most meaningful to them.

As the core of this course, we introduce the concept of Throwaway Culture that Pope Francis discusses in Laudato Si as a manifestation of modern, industrial culture and the UNSDGs as an alternative developmental model. This relationship stands as the conceptual framework of our academic research writing process and the hook from which we introduce dozens of possible historic and geographic research topics. We created a SLUH Passport that invites them into new experiences within the community around them and demands that they connect the lessons of each unit to their enrichment activities.

The presentation will unpack the inventory methodology and demonstrate how this research has been applied to create sustainability curricular pathways, advance Living Lab projects, and expand community partnerships at U of T. Specifically, the ESE -a team of undergrad researchers working for the Presidential Advisory Committee on Environment, Climate Change, and Sustainability chaired by Professor John Robinson-has developed three comprehensive inventories. The focus of the presentation will be on the first: a sustainability course inventory (SCI) generated using a keyword search based on the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This is one of the early SCIs that has been based on the SDGs. The inventory identified 2,228 unique sustainability courses which represents 25% of all U of T courses. By sharing how broadly established sustainability pedagogy already was at U of T, faculty and program chairs beyond traditional environmental disciplines began identifying with sustainability initiatives. Consequently, this generated the necessary administrative momentum for a three level Sustainability U pathways program to rapidly advance through planning and approval processes across U of T's five divisions. This pathways program will enable students in any field of study to receive recognition for selecting into courses and extracurriculars that focus on sustainability. The inventories will be used to determine relevance to sustainability and communicate certification requirements to students.

2015,Engineering for One Planet: Join a growing interdisciplinary community to define and foster environmentally responsible engineering,"Hosted by The Lemelson Foundation and VentureWell, this panel will provide attendees with an opportunity to learn about and join a multi-disciplinary, multi-sector initiative to co-create a framework to integrate principles of environmental responsibility in engineering education. Introduction As humanity demands more from our resource-constrained planet, we must generate solutions for today that do not become the problems of tomorrow. Together, we can leverage our collective ingenuity and knowledge to minimize potential negative environmental impacts on our planet and the life it supports. Role of Engineers A clear opportunity exists to forestall future unintended negative impact by preparing all future engineers and designers to invent with our planet in mind. Engineers build the vast majority of our human-made physical and virtual worlds. They are problem-solvers, finding technical solutions for our communities, businesses and governments. Many will become the inventors and entrepreneurs that create the future material world we live in. Engineers therefore hold enormous power to impact our planet for good or ill. Engineering education can be a key lever for equipping engineers for these responsibilities. Numerous courses and programs have emerged to prepare engineers to be environmentally and socially responsible, but these educational opportunities are not integrated into the educational preparation for the vast majority of engineering students. Co-creating an ERE Definition and Framework This initiative seeks to build upon, bridge and strengthen the efforts of individuals and institutions working to ensure engineers are environmentally responsible.

1925,Curriculum for (re)Conceptualizing the University Campus as an Ecosystem,"Can the planning and operations of a university campus be reconceptualized with an ecological and systems approach, viewing the campus environment as analogous to an ecosystem? If so, then an assessment of the 'campus ecosystem' may be defined in terms of the metabolic flux and cyclic processes of energy, materials, information and economic costs that occur within the coupled natural and human environs of the campus. From this assessment, one may determine the ecological footprint and carrying capacity of various campus functions and operations. This, in turn, will allow one to model and evaluate various scenarios, which may then serve as the basis for informed decision- and policymaking prioritized within the university budget's allocation of finite resources. This approach serves as the basis for an interdisciplinary elective course at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), a small, private, urban university in Chicago. The internationally acclaimed IIT campus planned by Mies van der Rohe in 1941, is used as a lab for real-world application of concepts and practices learned in the classroom. Offered each semester since Fall 2016, this course provides an experiential learning context in which students develop IIT campus sustainability standards for consideration and possible inclusion with the campus master planning process. A university campus shares some of the same UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) with that of cities, with specific common ground regarding SDG 11 toward being inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Toward this end, the course reconceptualizes the IIT campus as an ecosystem, which allows a more formalized level of inquiry. Findings relative to baseline metrics are then used to develop alternative scenarios, which are then assessed relative to their alignment with the university's overall vision and policy. To date, students have completed over 100 individual and team projects related to campus sustainability.",University of Utah,3994,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Coordination & Planning,Research,,,,"sustainability courses,project based learning",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Michael Iversen,University of Utah,University of Utah,3994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Iversen_1467.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16202/1445_Iversen_1467.pdf,,,,,,
2009,Preparing Graduates for the Sustainability Economy through an ILO Framework,"We are moving toward increasingly collaborative work environments where everyone can positively impact an organization's contribution to a sustainable economy. At Toronto's Humber College, our post-secondary graduates recognize they need a sustainability mindset in order to be career ready. As part of our goal to 'provide national leadership in shaping the future of sustainability' (Humber College 2018-2023 Strategic Plan), we aim to incorporate sustainability across all program curricula through an Institutional Learning Outcomes (ILO) framework. This framework prioritizes sustainability as one of three key mindsets designed to inform learning outcomes, course content, and assessments. Through extensive piloting and program mapping across six academic faculties, we found that sustainability was missing in most program outcomes. More importantly, our reports indicate that faculty do not know what sustainability is and how it is relevant to their teaching contexts. To address these gaps, we developed a multi-faceted plan to build faculty awareness through collaboration with internal partners such as the Office of Sustainability, the Centre for Teaching & Learning, and the Centre for Human Rights, Equity & Diversity. For instance, introducing the UN SDGs to instructors unfamiliar with or resistant to sustainability has increased capacity to deliver sustainability-focused content to students in all of Humber's 180 programs. To some extent, we have addressed this sustainability gap through creative problem-solving sessions and the development of faculty toolkits, but ongoing faculty support is needed for us to prepare our graduates to contribute meaningfully to the sustainable economy.",Humber College,1979,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"learning outcomes,on-campus collaboration",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Lara McInnis,Professor,Humber College,1979,Sarah Nieman,"Project Assistant, ILOs",Humber College,1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Nieman_1438.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16466/0915_Nieman_1438.pdf,,,,,,

1948,Values-Education and Inequity: Complicating Sustainability Education with a Justice Lens,"Nearly 40 years ago, Wendell Berry (1981) issued a call to educators to re-invent our colleges and universities, to move away from the mechanized framework of specialization and instead offer students educational experiences that reveal their responsibilities to the lands and communities that sustain them. 'It is clear that, more than any publication of books and articles, or any research,' Berry wrote, 'we need an annual increment of several hundred competently literate graduates who have some critical awareness of their inheritance and a sense of their obligation to it' (pp. 194-195). David Orr (1991), too, offered a directive for educational transformation, asking us to redefine measures of success. Rather than train people for roles in an unsustainable economic system, education should instead cultivate an informed citizenry equipped with both the practical wisdom and the ethical vision to motivate action for change. How can we help students question the education-career-success conveyor belt in an age where higher education is no longer supported as a public good and instead markets itself to students as customers, then saddles them with unprecedented debt? How, too, can we bring a critical lens to these clarion calls, acknowledging and addressing the systemic inequalities that students' lives are embedded in? This session presents strategies for incorporating values-education and reflection as a means for critiquing the sustainability of both capitalism and higher ed, helping students identify deeper intrinsic motivations for pursuing a degree. Participants will engage in critical dialogue to assess the social justice implications of this approach.",Oregon State University,4044,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,"values,social justice",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Jen Myers,"Instructor, Sustainability Double Degree Program",Oregon State University,4044,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Myers_1640.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16254/1400_Myers_1640.pptx,,,,,,

Food has a central place in individual lives, community culture, and global implications. The strong identification that people have to food provides an excellent opportunity for educators to make abstract issues like climate change more relevant through their connection to food systems. Specifically, we will (1) Discuss the rich opportunity for teaching provided by food, specifically in terms of building up students' individual skills related to food and nutrition as well as preparing them for the task of improving our broken global food system. (2) Share experiences and ideas related to food teaching from various disciplines. (3) Develop specific classroom implementation ideas.

2443,Curriculum and a Hands-On Project: Manual vs. Automated Irrigation Methods in the University Garden,"The Center for Urban Agriculture and Sustainability (CUAS) at the University of Houston-Downtown (UHD) has combined innovative curriculum with hands-on projects to teach sustainable practices. Students enrolled in the CUAS Experiential Learning program took a course in the spring semester, Fundamentals of Sustainability, where they learned the complexities of creating sustainable systems - analyzing problems from the complex interactions of social stability, economic growth and environmental health. In the summer students took Renewable Energy Systems where they designed solar-powered systems. In a summer project a group of students then compared irrigation methods of two garden beds in the UHD Garden. One bed was manually watered and the other bed was watered by an automatic irrigation system (to be hooked to the garden's solar power). This comparison allowed for analysis of energy consumption and water used in each bed along with agricultural implications of each method. Three plant varieties (okra, squash and eggplant) have been planted in a replicated block design down the axis of each garden bed and will be evaluated for final dry weight in early fall. Replicated soil samples are being collected and will be evaluated for nitrate levels over time. It is hypothesized that the less frequent and greater volume of water used in the hand-watered bed will leach nitrate out of the soil faster. Preliminary analysis indicates that the mechanized system is also creating healthier plants. The engineering and science components of this project expose students to cross-disciplinary teamwork and application of course topics. This project requires students to estimate economic investments, calculate energy needs to build solar power systems, maximize crop yield while minimizing water use, reduce nitrate pollution in water-ways and analyze the complex interactions of human energy needs, food production and environmental impact.",University of Houston - Downtown,1503,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Grounds,,Agriculture,,,"experiential learning,urban agriculture,irrigation",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Lisa Morano,"Director, Center for Urban Agriculture and Sustainability",University of Houston - Downtown,1503,Jeremiah Brice,Sustainability Staff,University of Houston - Downtown,1503,Ashley Carrera,Student,University of Houston - Downtown,1503,Jimmy Ha,Student,University of Houston - Downtown,1503,Leslie Lopez,Student,University of Houston - Downtown,1503,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2477,"Connecting Endowment Investing, Experiential Education and Curriculum to Build a Sustainable Economy","This session will discuss the growth of student-managed investment funds pursuing sustainable investing strategies, as well as the growth of sustainable investing curriculum development, highlighting current successful funds and courses, the different ways student-managed funds can be designed, and how new and existing funds can address sustainability factors in the investment process. Student-managed investment funds promote student leadership, advance education and real-world training, and enhance the ability of all graduates to drive sustainability solutions throughout their careers. Student consultations on sustainable investing to the institution's endowment based on student-managed fund performance are increasingly common, benefiting both students by providing practice and experiential education, as well as endowments by providing research and new ideas, advancing institutional sustainability leadership and student education. This session will highlight the work of faculty and students already employing sustainable investing strategies in their student-managed funds and courses, and will focus on how to scale this education-focused work through the creation of new funds and courses and expansion of current work. Participants will share what's happening at their institutions, and through facilitated dialogue exercises, participate in both individual and group action planning, ensuring that all attendees leave with concrete next steps and resources to move forward.

1929,Self-Sustainability Business Model for Degree Programs in Sustainability Education,"Higher education in the U.S. is experiencing budget cuts, program reductions and a decrease in state funding not to mention a decrease in enrollment and engagement of student. In response to this changing climate, universities are exploring unique business models. One of these such models is called Cost Recovery Model, which is an independent model that generates enough tuition revenue to cover the costs - both departmental and University - incurred in the annual operation of the program. The Ed.D. program in Educational Sustainability at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point runs on this self-sustaining model. More importantly, this model affords the opportunity for the program to build in a novel affiliate program called, Affiliate Scholar-Practitioner Program, that allows the program to affiliate with interdisciplinary faculty, staff and worldwide affiliates with co-reciprocal regenerative relationships as well as an applied residency. Join the director of this doctoral program and learn what a Cost Recovery Model is and how to leverage the model to build in expertise, cross-disciplinary capacity and engagement into programming in this current higher educational economically strapped climate.

1972,Self-Congratulatory Sustainability/Sustainability Light: Just What Are We Teaching?,"All over the United States, colleges tout their hyperlocal sustainability and recycling programs. Many do a thoughtful job of introducing students to aspects of sustainability, including the complex, ongoing effort to understand what sustainability might truly look like, at least in a regional context. Many increasingly link the effects of our lifestyles to increasing carbon emissions and environmental contamination. Yet for all the discussion and new improved curricula, many institutions still avoid structural critiques that might actually allow the emergence of deeper discussions and explorations of what it might look like to live more lightly on the planet. In other words, despite good intentions, sustainability courses tend to be sustainability light, remaining silent on the actual challenges of changing Western consumption, minimizing the issues of diverse economic positioning on this planet, failing to see the invisible bodies of others suffering in modern slavery, and failing to acknowledge and assess the unintended consequences of, for example, global recycling and conservation that destroys indigenous rights based in traditional conservation practices. The need to recognize, assess, and reconstitute effective and just sustainability projects is vital, yet sustainability courses, intended to teach students the how and why of sustainability, tend to teach only the portion that is immediately visible. This session seeks to deconstruct this sustainability light through both analysis and active discussion of the complicity such courses give evidence of, ways of working inside the institution, possible ways to teach sustainability as it must be taught on this extraordinarily at risk planet, and ways to bring into focus issues of those in the populations most at risk and/or enslaved by our current focus on sustainability light.",Olympic College,3955,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,"sustainability courses,curriculum development,grief",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Arlene Plevin,Professor,Olympic College,3955,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Plevin_1736.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16322/1445_Plevin_1736.pptx,,,,,,
2049,"""Living Labs"" that Integrate Sustainability Education, Community Engagement & Workforce Development","A growing number of sustainability-related internships, practicum and fellowship opportunities are available, and increasingly, such programs are also working explicitly to integrate with community sustainability efforts, becoming network hubs and connectors for work in their cities, states and regions while placing students with partners in those networks to do projects. This mutually beneficial model presents opportunity for local and regional economic development and alignment around regional sustainability plans and visions. It brings new capacity not only to solve problems in the short-term-embodying the sustainability pillar of economic responsibility providing cross-sector organizations with added capacity without breaking the bank-but also to build long-term sustainability-informed professional capacity across many industries and sectors. Of course, no one-size-fits-all model will work for all institutions. This session will feature a panel of presenters from three different campuses who, through the experience of building such programs, have gained perspective on some key ingredients: i.e., curating projects as part of an integrated narrative about leadership and connection to place; utilizing an explicitly pedagogical and reflective framework; and scaffolding all of these components with high-quality mentorship and high-impact networks. Participants will come away with a framework they can use to offer this sort of community-based experiential sustainability education, informed by the range of the presenters' (very varied) programs; from how to fund and manage the programs, identify projects and partners, professionally cultivate and connect program participants and alumni, and communicate about the need for and benefits of such programs to a range of stakeholders.",Boston University,2246,University of New Hampshire,0724,Indiana University Bloomington,6354,University of New Hampshire,0724,,,,,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,"living labs,community-based learning,Campus as a Living Lab Track,workforce development",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Dennis Carlberg,Associate VP for University Sustainability,Boston University,2246,Megan Carney,"Sustainability Fellows Program Coordinator, Sustainability Institute",University of New Hampshire,0724,Danni Schaust,"ISDP Program Manager, Indiana Sustainability Development Program (ISDP) / Sustain IU",Indiana University Bloomington,6354,Fiona Wilson,"Deputy Chief Sustainability Officer/Director, Sustainability Institute",University of New Hampshire,0724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Carney_1737.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16628/0915_Carney_1737.pdf,,,,,,

To fulfill their strategic goals, Merry Lea effectively runs many types of programs for grades Pre-K to 12, as well as offers an advanced degree of Masters of Arts in Environmental Education. The educational endeavors in this natural sanctuary that this poster will focus on includes two innovative undergraduate semesters. The Sustainability Leadership Semester (SLS) and Agroecology Summer Intensive (ASI) are residential undergraduate programs that focus on connecting people to place, linking the past, present, and future of sustainability, and bringing the concept of quality, hands-on experience into the realm of higher education. Both of these programs explore the many ways to contribute towards building a sustainable, resilient future for our communities in the midst of our rapidly changing planet. The students are motivated to explore the continuously changing facets of environmental sustainability. This involves interaction between students, connections with the college faculty, and involvement with community members. The integrative sessions within these semesters also include field trips to meet a variety of local sustainability initiators and professionals, bringing real-life examples into the 'classroom.'

2308,"Revolutionizing Sustainability Connections: Corporations, Communities, and Higher Education","The PSEG Institute for Sustainability Studies at Montclair State University advances sustainability by developing community-engaged research projects and building educational programs through academic-corporate-public partnerships. We engage in activities that promote healthy environments and sustainable economies that support resilient communities. One of the PSEG ISS cross-sector partnered programs is the Green Teams program, a ten-week transdisciplinary team internship program held between May and August annually in partnership with New Jersey Higher Education Partnership for Sustainability (NJHEPS). The Green Teams program (Kay et al. 2018) immerses and engages students from all majors, diverse backgrounds and widespread universities in intensive teamwork, professional development, broad inclusion, and deep Sustainability training. The Green Teams program targets upper level undergraduates (exceptional rising sophomores may also be considered) from any discipline who are interested in Sustainability. Green Teams serve corporations, organizations, non-profits, government agencies, and community groups to address substantial Sustainability issues identified by host organizations. Students in Green Teams attend trainings approximately one day per week, visit field sites and engage in enrichment and volunteer activities approximately one day every two weeks, attend meetings with corporate representatives approximately 2 hours per week, and work on their projects and deliverables the remainder of the time. They work intensively 40 hours per week for 10 weeks. Companies and organizations are recruited from direct contact as well as through well-established networks. To date, we have engaged 25 corporate and community partners, including Fortune 500 corporations, local small businesses, and New Jersey public organizations. Outcomes include: cost/benefit analysis of energy use reduction strategies; greenhouse gas inventory of a city including vehicle fleet emission; Python code that input environmental data as well as manufacturer specifications for EV buses and output recommendations for purchasing EV buses for specific routes; designed in-line water treatment and water reduction strategies for manufacturing; inventoried, mapped, and proposed methods of removing invasive species; created technical report aligning an energy company with climate action goals and Paris Accord; created a GRI core report template; analyzed landfill waste diversion for EPS recycling and developed ROI for start-up using recycled product, completing circular economy; developed waste dashboard for a multinational corporation; increased stakeholder engagement with existing/new sustainability initiatives; assessed geothermal use for a hospital system. Clearly there are a range of projects developed for cross-sector partners. These student-generated products are implemented and used. Coming out of the program, students receive internship offers, top scholarships for graduate and professional programs, and offers for full-time employment in sustainability-related careers of their choosing.

1915,The Experiential Learning Lab: Coproduction Through Campus Staff/Faculty/Community Partnerships,"Challenges in implementing and sustaining on- and off-campus experiential learning projects continue to deter staff, faculty and community partners from engaging in them. Persistent challenges include: student schedules and time constraints restricting participation, higher workloads for all involved that is inadequately compensated, the sustained maintenance of longer-term commitments that can fall on staff to manage, and lack of funding for participant's time or resources to maintain the project. Moreover, experiential learning runs the risk of developing a dualistic client/professional relationship wherein the roles of instructor, staff facilitator and community partner compartmentalize the people involved, and work against collaboration. These challenges prevent integrating University staff and community partners into curricular design and course delivery in ways that embody and model the collaborative, non-hierarchical structure of engagement that experiential learning purports to embrace. In establishing a new undergraduate major in Sustainability at the University of Dayton, we developed Experiential Learning Labs (ELLs) addressing structural and logistical challenges of experiential learning for on-campus projects. Using Elinor Ostrom's insights on coproduction, we discovered how ELLs support the emergence of a collaborative, dynamic relationship between staff and faculty as the course instructors, and the students. ELLs provide an institutional tool and model for facilitating experiential learning projects in higher education, which also supports the generation of social capital. These ELLs provide a flexible vehicle for experiential learning in a variety of contexts, from a cooking lab attached to a history of food course, to an integrative experience on sustainable watersheds. In launching the first ELLs this year, we have discovered how they can be a method for embedding collaborative pedagogical practices built on the coproduction of the course curriculum and delivery. We face challenges; however, we found that ELLs are a profitable endeavor, economically facilitating the work of university staff, and creating social capital between stakeholders-students, staff, and faculty.",University of Dayton,2170,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,"living labs,Campus as a Living Lab Track,experiential learning,challenges",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Rebecca Potter,"Director, Sustainability Program",University of Dayton,2170,Leslie King,"Director, Rivers Institute",University of Dayton,2170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_King_1399.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17728/0830_King_1399.pdf,,,,,,
2454,Teaching Sustainability Education through the Lens of Leadership Education,"Sustainability education is a broad topic that crosses many disciplines. While some institutions offer sustainability-specific degree programs others have placed focus on implementing sustainability education within their current programs. Since around 2008 when sustainability education began to show stronger traction in higher education, educators and administrations have discussed and debated the best methods for teaching sustainability. Considering sustainability education crosses different dimensions, specifically economic, environmental, and social (the Triple Bottom Line), it can be difficult for educators to know what topics to include and how to present those topics to students. In this presentation I will discuss teaching sustainability through the lens of leadership education. This idea stems from work conducted within the Educational Leadership program at Minnesota State University-Moorhead. Leadership education addresses many issues that fall under the 'umbrella' of sustainability. Students address topics and solutions for improving economic, environmental, and social issues faced by communities, public school systems, and higher education institutions. Though sustainability crosses various disciplines, the ideas and principals of sustainability education closely align with leadership education. Therefore, I argue that instead of reinventing the wheel, we look at what experts in the field of leadership education are using to teach controversial and implicit issues. The lens of leadership is one that can be easily applied to any discipline, and it is beneficial because it encourages students to think critically, problem-solve, and determine ethical decisions.",Colorado State University,0828,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,"leadership,teaching sustainability",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Renee Harmon,"Assistant Professor, Minnesota State University-Moorhead and Colorado State University",Colorado State University,0828,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1936,What Sustainability Skills Do Employers Want?,"The overarching goal of sustainability education is to make the concepts understandable to students in ways that influence their attitudes and behaviors to carry forward into their careers. In doing so, we prioritize a holistic collection of competencies, skills, and values that translate to real-world issues. However, this is only one side of the story. There is a pressing need to align our sustainability training with an understanding of what specific sustainability-related skills employers are looking for so that we can prepare students to succeed. This presentation will share findings from two studies that directly engaged the business sector in Hong Kong. The first focused on managers and directors whose job descriptions relate to sustainability management or functionality. The second focused on employers across the entire business sector, providing a baseline for the business sector perspective on the importance of specific sustainability-related skills and knowledge. While these studies were conducted in Hong Kong, they contain elements of commonality that transcend culture, language and geography, which will be further explored in the discussion.

2537,Building Off of Prior Knowledge... Even When it's Wrong,"Higher education has been designated by scholars as the most promising mechanism for preparing future generations to engage in sustainable living. But however encouraging the infusion of sustainability into higher education may be, it is important to remember that students arrive on campus with their own (though not necessarily correct) preconceptions. In this study, we surveyed students at Michigan State University to examine the extent to which their present levels of sustainability knowledge differed according to where they learned about sustainability in the past. Results demonstrate that the source of prior sustainability knowledge was significantly related to current level of sustainability knowledge. In particular, acquisition of sustainability knowledge in the classroom, both in high school and college, had the strongest (positive) influence on present knowledge. In contrast, there was a significant (negative) relationship between how frequently students gathered knowledge from their parents and their current levels of knowledge. Based on these findings, we suggest that instructors need to be mindful about the types of prior knowledge they use as a springboard when teaching students about sustainability. For instance, because prior academic learning had a positive influence on present sustainability knowledge, instructors ought to surface and reinforce what students have learned in previous education when teaching new sustainability topics. Additionally, instructors should remain cognizant that that family members may lead students astray, and thus they should engage students in discerning between what they know from their families and the new sustainability topics they are learning. Overall, results from this study can be used in conjunction with traditional teaching approaches to better educate students about sustainability.",Michigan State University,0439,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,"sustainability literacy,surveys",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Adam Zwickle,Assistant Professor,Michigan State University,0439,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Zwickle_1296.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18419/0830_Zwickle_1296.pptx,,,,,,
2412,Pursuing Sustainability in Education Abroad: Tools & Techniques,"Well-designed education abroad programs expose students to the many ways other cultures prioritize and pursue sustainability. Foreign approaches to sustainability, biodiversity, and social justice reveal to students abroad the culturally distinct skills, attitudes, and behavioral habits that can be experienced, assimilated, assessed and - more importantly - transferred back home. How do we design programs that go beyond cultural learning and help students experience - through comparative approaches to implementing SDGs - how other people live lives far more sustainable than theirs?

2485,Comparing Environmental Literacy of U.S. University Freshmen With Incoming International Students,"Since 2014, Pittsburg State University (a regional institution in southeast Kansas), has administered a survey to measure environmental literacy, pro-social environmental behaviors, and issue involvement of all incoming freshman as part of a required Freshman Experience class. Incoming international students are also required to take this course and have their own class sections. This research presents the preliminary results of an analysis comparing the responses of domestic incoming freshman students to those of incoming international students. There are a variety of research studies focused on students' perceptions related to sustainability knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and habits. Many of these are samples of undergraduates at different academic levels from US regional institutions. Common threads in this pool of research include a wide range of knowledge and practices, and, overall, a lower level of personal engagement in sustainability practices. The analysis presented here will allow the assessment of results in that context and also provide a broader geographic context in which to interpret the results. There have been changes in the cohort of international students to the United States since 2014 as the result of global scale political changes. This makes it impossible to directly compare different years of data of international students and makes assumptions of some consistency of countries of origin of our students through time unreasonable. Consequently, this analysis is not focused on the country of origin of international students. This analysis does, however, provide a more global context to better understand the knowledge and behavior of freshmen American university students and gives a broader context with which to frame what freshmen know as they enter university based on this coarse geography. If international students do show more awareness, they may serve as a positive influence on sustainability efforts on campus.",Pittsburg State University,1234,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,"international,sustainability literacy,environmental literacy",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Catherine Hooey,University Professor of Geography,Pittsburg State University,1234,Alicia Mason,Professor of Communication,Pittsburg State University,1234,Timothy Bailey,University Professor ofGeography,Pittsburg State University,1234,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2140,Two Approaches to Teaching Sustainable Economics,"Economic change is at the heart of making societies sustainable. The globalized industrial economy produces great wealth for some while increasingly disenfranchising and dispossessing many. As the current economy grows exponentially, its material and human/social bases face increasing exploitation, contributing to accelerating and converging sustainability crises. An economy as a complex system develops from what is possible biophysically, from ongoing ecosystemic interactions, and from human actions and social forces. In order to envision and create a sustainable economy, people must learn how the current economy developed in relation to its social and environmental context as well as how and why those relationships must change. In support of this effort, two presenters offer their approaches to teaching sustainable economics. One presenter describes a uniquely redesigned principles-level economics course whose sustainability focus provides a quadruple bottom line perspective and promotes transition to a circular economy. This course integrates a series of experiential learning and civic engagement activities that immerse learners in a complex, capacious, and contested issue that serves as a vehicle to teach economic theory and to introduce students to industries, policies, and innovations that will directly affect their productive futures. Indigenous knowledge, values, and resource management systems are presented alongside western economic concepts, both in the classroom and via place-based learning at community partner organizations. Students build relationships with the land, peers, and community members that enhance the learning experience and help bring economic concepts to life. The other presenter describes essential concepts, materials, and pedagogies developed through her long-term engagement in teaching a sustainable economics course. The course is based in biophysical and historical approaches to understanding the current economy and activating potential avenues for sustainability-oriented economic change. An in-depth final project that calls upon students to envision and create a proposal for an alternative currency for their local community serves as one example of how sustainable economic theory and practice may be applied at a tangible community level.",University of Hawaii Kapiolani Community College,4274,Colorado Mountain College,0775,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,"environmental economics,teaching sustainability",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Jaclyn Lindo,Faculty,University of Hawaii Kapiolani Community College,4274,Tina Evans,"Professor, Sustainability Studies",Colorado Mountain College,0775,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Evans.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18218/0915_Evans.pdf,,,,,,
2033,Teaching to the SDGs: Experience and Resources for Business & Sustainability Curricula,"In this session, two experienced faculty will share their approaches, resources and lessons learned in teaching Business & Sustainability courses. Prof. Dann Sklarew developed and has delivered the Business & Sustainability course at George Mason University. Prof. Ira Feldman has taught Business & Sustainability at Fordham University and at George Mason University. He has also pioneered an online cohort on Business & Sustainability for Sustainability Curriculum Consortium (SCC). While many are aware of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), few educators are conversant enough -- with their content (goals, targets, indicators) and with the progress on their implementation in the public and private sectors since 2015 -- to effectively build the SDGs into their course curricula. Also known as the 'Global Goals,' the SDGs are widely considered to be the roadmap for sustainability through 2030. The next generation of sustainability leaders -- our current students -- must understand the significance of the SDGs as a core component of the broader sustainability curriculum. This session will assist educators with the basic resources and resources necessary to effectively teach to the SDGs, with special emphasis on how the private sector views its role vis-a-vis governments, and the implementation approaches utilized by corporate entities and financial sector organizations to incorporate SDGs into their sustainability strategies, reporting and disclosure. The session leaders will also facilitate -- during the session and with online follow-up after the AASHE Conference -- an information exchange on SDG resources among the attendees. This session directly relates to several AASHE 2019 Conference themes, including: -- How can higher education most effectively collaborate with business, government and civil society to create a sustainable economy? -- How can higher education best prepare students for success in a sustainable economy?",Sustainability Curriculum Consortium,6873,George Mason University,3981,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Ira Feldman,Founder & Managing Director,Sustainability Curriculum Consortium,6873,Dann Sklarew,Professor and Coordinator of Sustainability Initiatives,George Mason University,3981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Feldman_1599.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16561/1100_Feldman_1599.pptx,1100_Feldman_1599.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16561/1100_Feldman_1599.pdf,,,,
2313,Debunking the Myth of the 'Idiot Farmer': Alternative Forms of Agriculture for a Healthier Economy,"The goal of this presentation is to highlight the importance of a new understanding of agriculture: directed by the young and educated, data driven, and focused on healthy and localized food production. There is a common misconception that farmers are uneducated and that farming is a lowly career choice. How do we reconcile this misguided idea with the growing movement toward an even more technology-driven agriculture focused in urban areas? As this is a necessary adjunct to existing rural farming, how do we properly educate students entering into new fields of study and careers that can focus on this shift? The presentation will begin in broad understanding-- of how a functional greenhouse ties together virtually every subject matter. Operating a productive greenhouse includes a knowledge of art and design, business, biology, and policy (to name a few). In understanding how greenhouses work, we can better approach the complexities of a multifaceted economy. Like a greenhouse, a sustainable economy can only properly function by thinking within an interdisciplinary and whole-systems framework. The most important takeaway is that an understanding of agriculture is integral to a sustainably minded educational system. There is no reason why agriculture should not be taught in math, health/nutrition, or engineering. The only way to change the mindset of the lowly farmer, is to teach students, at a higher level, about how it works. Farming can and will become a viable career when we understand that it requires a high level of intelligence to function well. Furthermore, as our system of agriculture is changing alongside new technologies, smart greenhouse design can both offset some of the damages of climate change (including water and energy use), as well as create an adaptive solution to the effects of it. Greenhouse technology is vital to the future of agriculture.",Ceres Greenhouse Solutions,9032,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,Agriculture,,,"student attitudes,greenhouses,farms",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Jaclyn Jorgensen,Business Representative,Ceres Greenhouse Solutions,9032,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Jorgensen_1184.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18016/1100_Jorgensen_1184.pdf,,,,,,

1889,"Transdisciplinary Education for Employability, Sustainability, and Democracy","With continued development of artificial intelligence and robotics, increasing technological displacement of human labor is a concern for, not only low-skilled laborers who complete routine tasks, but professionals whose thinking and reasoning work has been assumed by many to be irreplaceable. It is important to consider the limits of these technologies for addressing current and emerging crises of employment, sustainability, and democracy. These challenges demand creativity, transdisciplinary synthesis of ideas and practices, context-sensitive sense-making and action, discernment, empathy, and humility. Appropriately prepared humans are uniquely capable of meeting these challenges, and higher education content and processes can assist in preparing graduates who can do so. The presenter discusses theories of enforced dependency and transdisciplinarity, explaining how these theories can inform education that prepares graduates to be both robot proof with regard to employment and effective citizens who advance the concepts and practices of democracy and sustainability.",Colorado Mountain College,0775,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,"transdisciplinarity,artificial intelligence,robotics",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Tina Evans,"Professor, Sustainability Studies",Colorado Mountain College,0775,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Evans_1232.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16105/0830_Evans_1232.pdf,,,,,,
2023,Mapping the Food Systems Major: A Qualitative Approach to Curriculum Mapping,"Do you want to make curriculum mapping a more meaningful process? This session will describe a qualitative curriculum mapping approach used to review core courses in the University of Minnesota's new Food Systems major. The approach blended instructor interviews with syllabus review using qualitative data analysis software to move beyond a simple tally of student learning outcomes. The qualitative approach outlined in this session led to a rich picture of an evolving curriculum and identified areas of depth and weakness both within courses and across the curriculum. The qualitative curriculum mapping process was implemented as part of an ongoing multi-institutional effort to develop a signature pedagogy for sustainable food systems education (SFSE) programs. Curriculum mapping formed an early critical step in identifying and refining a shared set of key competencies for students in SFSE programs. As expected, the process generated richly detailed information about the core courses in Minnesota's Food Systems major and identified gaps in teaching and assessment relative to key student learning outcomes. But participating faculty and graduate students were surprised by the extent to which this approach to mapping also prompted constructive discussion about those outcomes to better reflect faculty goals for the new major. The process provided a novel way to identify common themes in how faculty understand the knowledge, attitudes and skills students will need to work effectively toward more just and sustainable food systems. This session will include a demonstration of the qualitative data analysis software used for curriculum mapping and is designed to help audience participants consider how qualitative approaches could be applied to their own curriculum mapping processes.","University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",0032,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Food & Dining,,,,,"food systems,curriculum development",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Amanda Sames,"PhD student, Conservation Science Graduate Program","University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",0032,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Sames_1515.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16517/0915_Sames_1515.pdf,,,,,,
2197,"Sustainability Across the Curriculum: History, Status & Best Practices From a National Inventory","Curricular innovations for sustainability have been at the heart of the AASHE network since its inception, and these programs continue to exhibit high value through the AASHE STARS reporting tool. However, much less is known about the current status of the sustainability across the curriculum movement throughout higher education as a collective effort. To assess this, members schools of the AASHE Centers for Sustainability Across the Curriculum network conducted an online inventory to collect information about current and past workshops, programs, or projects that support faculty development for sustainability. In addition, information from STARS credit AC-7, focused on incentives for developing sustainability courses, was added to provide data from nearly 200 programs in a national inventory. With this information, we hope to improve networking and sharing of best practices for those working to advance sustainability across the curriculum. This presentation will share findings that answer questions such as: Who are some of the national leaders in faculty development for sustainability? How are these programs being incentivized? Are there areas (content, regional, or thematic) of demand or saturation across the US for these workshops or programs? What commonalities have led some of the programs to sustain or fold over time?

2467,Seeing Sustainability Through Indigenous Eyes: Collaborative Cross-Cultural Teaching and Learning,"This presentation will showcase a field course offered by George Mason University in collaboration with the Maijuna indigenous group of the Peruvian Amazon. The authors worked with the Maijuna to design curriculum focused on their culture and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) as well as their biologically diverse ancestral forests. Curriculum and hands-on activities were developed around community-based conservation and sustainability initiatives in Maijuna lands focused on traditional agriculture, sustainable palm fruit harvesting, handicraft production, and native stingless beekeeping, among others. During the course, Maijuna elders and leaders served as co-instructors, offering students a rare opportunity to learn directly from indigenous people who are fighting for cultural survival and pursuing economic initiatives that promote a sustainable income while ensuring conservation of ancestral lands. With fewer than 500 individuals, the Maijuna are one of the smallest and most endangered indigenous groups in Peru and they live in one of Earth's most biologically rich places. The Maijuna successfully fought to end economically and ecologically destructive logging and poaching in their lands. With the help of allies, in 2015 they pushed the Peruvian government to officially protect over 391,000-hectares of their territory (an area 22% larger than Yosemite National Park). These victories are unique given that most indigenous cultures and lands in the Amazon basin are under siege. As part of this curriculum development initiative, extensive assessment of student learning outcomes was completed. Also, focus groups were conducted with Maijuna instructors to evaluate and monitor their perceptions of student engagement, course content, and overall course success. Results will be shared as well as lessons learned for teaching students to critically evaluate real-world community conservation and sustainable development initiatives in indigenous communities.",George Mason University,3981,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,"indigenous focus,conservation,sustainability courses",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Andrew Wingfield,"Director, Environmental and Sustainability Studies",George Mason University,3981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Wingfield_1867.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18084/1100_Wingfield_1867.pdf,,,,,,
2468,Freshman Engineering Students see Value in Sustainability-themed Project-based Learning,"Engineers are required to evaluate the economic, policy, environmental, and social implications of their work in order to promote sustainability in design and manufacturing. Traditionally, university training in problem solving is primarily done using decontextualized textbook problems. To prepare engineering students to consider the critical perspectives and deep contextual factors required by sustainability-focused work while maintaining a high level of disciplinary rigor is a pressing challenge. In January 2016, Georgia Tech launched a campus-wide academic initiative-the Center for Serve-Learn-Sustain (SLS)-aimed at preparing undergraduate students in all majors to use their disciplinary knowledge and skills to contribute to the major societal challenge of creating sustainable communities. This poster presents student perspectives on a sustainability intervention and related activities that bring social justice and sustainability issues into the classroom through project-based learning in a freshman engineering design course. All students in this course learn creative design ideation, formal sketching techniques, CAD tools and basics of design-for-manufacturing and 3D Printing. In addition to this disciplinary content, the SLS center-affiliated section of the course also implemented the following sustainability interventions; (i.) individual projects that address wasteful human behavior and environmental sustainability in product designs, and (ii) team projects with contextualized design problems that address social, environmental and economic sustainability aspects in designing large engineering structures. Through the contextualization of real-world problems, students develop system-thinking skills during the design, implementation, and evaluation stages of engineering solution. This poster discusses various intervention strategies, ongoing assessment methods, and preliminary results from thematic analysis of student response to post-activity reflections.",Georgia Institute of Technology,1109,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,project based learning,10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Raghu Pucha,Faculty,Georgia Institute of Technology,1109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2494,Evaluating knowledge and awareness of 'Sustainability' initiatives among college students,"This study assesses college students' knowledge and awareness of sustainability issues. Upon the approval of an IRB, data was collected using the Campus Sustainability questionnaire. Students from a university in the southeastern part of Texas were selected and asked to participate in the study voluntarily by answering a self-report questionnaire. Findings indicate that only a minority of the students knew what sustainability was, but 95.8% indicated it was important. Although the University has committed to climate and sustainability agreements, majority of the students were not aware of it and only about 17% knew that the University's Strategic Plan has a sustainability component. More than half of the students also indicated that sustainability issues were not infused into curriculum courses or programs and they had no knowledge of any alternative power source for the University. We concluded that a majority of the students were not conversant with sustainability issues and were largely unaware of campus sustainability initiatives. This subject is unique in that at this time and age it can be thought that sustainability issues related to economy, environment, or social are a common knowledge in university settings and are widely integrated into the university system. However, this study proves otherwise. It reminds us there is still a long ways to go.

2478,A Problem Solving Approach to Teaching Sustainability Studies,"There has been a recent proliferation in the number of undergraduate and graduate programs in sustainability-related areas. Many of them have capstone experiences. Here I describe a culminating capstone experience for a new interdisciplinary undergraduate major in Sustainability Studies that takes an integrative, problem-solving approach. This is achieved by first providing the necessary content to identify and understand our linked environmental, economic and social problems, but then moves beyond the usual doom-and-gloom scenarios that pervade our teaching in this area by showing that sustainability can be achieved through specific solutions that use policy, science and technology, and business and economic approaches. Examples of assignments and student work that include problem identification, systems analysis, and the roles that individual actions, organizations, government, innovation and entrepreneurship, and unique collaborations among diverse stakeholders in solving these problems will be offered. Ultimately students explore successful ways in which their specific problem has been addressed globally, and develop a campaign of their own to further the cause. Resources for this course including the use of domains, blogging, social media, case studies, and new books entitled Sustainable Solutions: Problem Solving for Current and Future Generations, and Tools for Grassroots Activists: Best Practices for Success in the Environmental Movement will also be highlighted.",Muhlenberg College,3697,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,"capstone experience,sustainability studies,teaching sustainability",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Richard Niesenbaum,Professor and Director of Sustainability Studies,Muhlenberg College,3697,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Niesenbaum_1864.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18118/1100_Niesenbaum_1864.pdf,,,,,,
1968,Basic Sustainability Co-Curricular Course,"In Latin-American countries, and specifically in Mexico I have noticed students lack sustainability literacy, and always think sustainability is about planting trees and recycling. One of the goals of the Sustainability Office is to incorporate sustainability into the curriculum and to reach out to students. One way to do this was by creating a co-curricular course on Sustainability. This introductory course to Sustainability tries to make students have a broader concept of the term sustainability and to connect all environmental and social problems with practical solutions and lifestyle changes. This is a 16-week course and through games, group activities, case studies, and documentaries tries to cover, from the global to the local issues we are exposed to every day. One example of what we are doing is students have to watch at home the documentary TrueCost, and then they have to list all garments with material and location of manufacturing. It is a really wide opening experience for the student to learn about the impact of fast fashion and also about externalities, human labor, pesticides and cotton production. We started this course in 2016 with just one group of 20 students and today we have 3 groups with 65 students. Last year we wanted to do something new based on past students recommendations and this was that they wanted to put hands on deck. I decided to form groups; students were going to identify a sustainability problem on campus, do research on what the problem was and make a behavioral change project to solve the particular issue. Doing this I am having around 15 different projects on campus with different ranges of impacts. One of the very first projects was to eliminate styrofoam from the dinner services and after one year students did it. Our next step is to create a Campus Lab Initiative having this amazing experience with these pilot groups.",Universidad de Monterrey,7262,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,"games,sustainability courses,sustainability literacy",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Cesar Nanni,Sustainability Project Coordinator,Universidad de Monterrey,7262,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Nanni_1725.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16312/0830_Nanni_1725.pdf,,,,,,
2482,Teaching Water Sustainability Through Regional and Global Studies at the University of Pittsburgh,"The poster exhibits a multidisciplinary approach to understanding water equity and sustainability in the understudied region of Central Eurasia. The effort is led by faculty from the University of Pittsburgh, who designed and implemented a cycle of three undergraduate courses on the theme 'Water in Central Eurasia: Tributaries of Change.' Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the courses incorporate multiple subject areas and are offered through the Departments of History and Political Science at the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, through the Swanson School of Engineering, and the College of Business Administration. Enrolled students bring technological, economic, and humanistic approaches to water management and further consider these approaches in other world regions and at the global scale. The 'Water in Central Eurasia' initiative provides students with skills to create a more sustainable relationship between communities and the environment. Having curriculum that acknowledges shifts in social realities and technical horizons allows students to focus not only on the 'bottom line,' but also on the real human consequences of water management. By investigating and challenging conventional frameworks in engineering and business courses, students are prepared to think more critically about the commodification of water and can shift their understandings towards a more inclusive economy. This multidisciplinary study of water in Central Eurasia challenges disciplinary silos. The poster will showcase how different analytical frameworks are mobilized in the courses. Combining the study of water with Central Eurasia not only provides a fascinating case study, but also allows students to make multidisciplinary, cross-regional, and global connections crucial to success in today's world.

2456,Academic Language for Sustainability Economy,"Co-creating the sustainability economy depends on the ability of up and coming generations to grasp opportunities to successfully address sustainability issues confronting our world. An authentic teacher preparation program features course content that engages pre-service teachers in systems' analysis of how their disciplines relate to key environmental, economic, and social conditions/issues within local, national or global communities. Guided by these lenses, content area lessons are approached transdisciplinarily, framed around real world problems to posit possible approaches to creative solutions to sustainability issues in ways that are lived or experienced. Shaped by Kemmis and Mutton's (2012) notion of praxis (action and practice) within sustainability curriculum our candidates plan curriculum around three dimensions: using language or literacy (cultural discursive dimension), students doing or working (material economic dimension) and taking action in a larger realm outside of the classroom (the social/political dimension). These dimensions, along with ESD pedagogical tools suggested by the UNESCO's Sourcebook (ESD UNESCO, 2012) guide our work in redefining praxis in pedagogy for teacher candidates. This session highlights strategic sustainability curriculum design strengthened by use of academic language. Questions guiding candidates' curriculum design include: 'What is the essential question (getting to the heart of the sustainability issue)?' 'What is the purpose for using language (language function) in the sustainability lesson?' How does the lesson provoke meaningful discourse (disciplinary writing and speaking) addressing the sustainability issue?' 'What is the assessment within the lesson and how does it provide students with an opportunity to use language effectively as a way to take action and promote change?' Candidate exemplars will be shared along with a guide for scaffolding sustainability curriculum using language as a foundation.",University of Wisconsin-River Falls,0508,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,"sustainability courses,curriculum development,communications,praxis",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Florence Monsour,Professor,University of Wisconsin-River Falls,0508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Monsour_1207.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18035/1100_Monsour_1207.pdf,,,,,,
2372,Why Is It So Darn Hard to Change!,"On top of his or her academic studies, thousands of issues bombard students asking them to be concerned about every issue from social inequalities to environmental crisis to political and corporate corruption. With all of that pressure, many students buckle under and simply say that it is too difficult to affect change. Therefore, how do we generate passion around an issue that seems so overwhelming that they view it as being impossible to change? How do we design a course that teaches students to filter through all of the rhetoric to form reasonable solutions to critical issues that threaten sustainability? From the perspective of a Sustainability Coordinator, this session will explore the development of an Introduction to Sustainability course. The session will specifically offer perspectives about how 'action assignments' engage students to explore his or her behaviors and how 'service learning opportunities' promote academic and personal growth. The presentation will review various online simulations, videos, and other resources used throughout the course.",Winthrop University,0144,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,,,,,,"sustainability courses,curriculum development,service learning,change management",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Christopher Johnson,Sustainability Coordinator,Winthrop University,0144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Johnson_1621.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17514/1100_Johnson_1621.pdf,,,,,,
2061,"Integrating Contemplative Practice, Social Justice and Sustainability as a Unified Model","Humanity is at a crisis point. Numerous indicators across a plurality of domains - including skyrocketing depression and substance abuse, economic inequality, climate change, and fisheries collapse - demonstrate that our systems have entered a period of profound instability. Though we have made tremendous strides, the traditional models of sustainability are no longer sufficient for affecting deep and lasting societal change. Currently, only scattered efforts persist throughout all of higher education to unify sustainability and social justice. And almost no one is bringing in mindfulness-based contemplative practice as integral pieces in a single sustainability model, yet doing so is essential. From this understanding, Naropa University has desegregated these offices into one, The Office for Inclusive Community. The OIC is a new community resilience hub that unifies traditional sustainability with contemplative practice techniques, and social justice objectives. In this workshop, we introduce participants to our philosophy and praxis, and how these seemingly distinct concepts overlap so broadly as to be inseparable. Naropa University is uniquely suited to create and implement new models that adequately prepare our students to handles emerging and entrenched challenges. We are building a new template for organizations to integrate into their leadership, policies, and practices that will help guide us toward powerfully achieving our shared objectives, and deepen our impact with students and the community at large. Through facilitated breakout sessions, participants will construct a custom framework for harmonizing traditional sustainability metrics with contemplative practice techniques and social justice objectives at their own campuses. Participants will leave with a robust understanding of first steps for developing a deeply sustainable and restorative Academy, one that serves the students' whole being for lasting change.",Naropa University,3802,,,,,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,,,,,"mindfulness,social justice",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Michael Bauer,Sustainability Director,Naropa University,3802,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Bauer_1163.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16674/1445_Bauer_1163.pdf,1445_Bauer_1163_1028_153015.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16674/1445_Bauer_1163_1028_153015.pdf,,,,

Our presentation will cover the importance of addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion on Higher Education campuses. We will cover how designing an engagement process for students, alumni and staff allows the built environment to support inclusion on campus. - Creating space for diverse voices in organizations - Closing the opportunity gap for minority student groups; and - How to design a 360-engagement process to influence the built environment. -Historic connections of the institutes on the UF Campus and how this influenced the design of the two new cultural institutes.

2031,Document & Web Accessibility: Making Content Available to All,"Most sustainability offices use websites and other online resources as a low-impact way share information - but common design choices and technology flaws make many websites, PDFs, videos, and other online-content inaccessible to those with disabilities. It's time to review your materials and ensure your information is inclusive, accessible, and equitably designed! Web accessibility ensures information access regardless of device, language, culture, location, or physical and mental ability, and makes resources equitably available to those with cognitive, hearing, and mobility impairments. Accessibility is a critical practice for social sustainability, and, case studies show that accessible websites have better search results, reduced maintenance costs and increased audience reach. This session will provide a blueprint for understanding web accessibility design principles, assessing your content, and creating a plan for remediation. In 2019, Cornell's Campus Sustainability Office comprehensively updated sustainablecampus.cornell.edu to meet W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 standards. The team will present on their design and development process, and walk session participants through a live tutorial of how to assess web materials, work with web developers, and begin create a plan for remediation. Session participants will have an opportunity to use free and paid tools available for web accessibility in real-time, and see examples of what works (and what doesn't) in Cornell's ongoing goal to update 100% of existing sustainability resources in print, PDF, graphics, and social media to meet similar standards.

2035,Digging In: Specific Examples of Including Diversity in Sustainability Work,"We all have to make sure the sustainability movement is not a white, elitist movement. Join two Sustainability Directors as they share their successes, challenges, and lessons learned through integrating diversity into campus sustainability programs. Central College is a private college of 1,200 students situated in rural Iowa, in a community that is over 90% white, with a strong Dutch identity dating back to its first European settlers. Meanwhile, the state as a whole is rapidly growing more urban and more diverse. In this changing context, learning to solve sustainability challenges requires learning to engage diverse racial and cultural groups, both on campus and in surrounding communities. This presentation will describe and evaluate some ways Central College has made diversity a key focus for sustainability education, including a series of speakers and artists, collaborations among diverse student groups, and service-learning partnerships with community organizations serving immigrants and refugees. In addition, we will share ways we are engaging rural, white Iowans in conversations about politically polarized topics including immigration and climate change. Bemidji State University, a public school of 5000 students in northern Minnesota, is surrounded by the three largest tribal nations in Minnesota. Bemidji State University and the surrounding community have worked on Ojibwe language integration and collaborated on many events that aim to educate the campus and community about race relations, white privilege, and the history of the land.

1919,Considering Low-Income Students in Sustainability,"Lower-income students are more likely to feel the impacts of climate change and are less likely to be major contributors of carbon emissions. Despite this, many climate change solutions focus on new technologies, the cost of which is passed onto students. As a community college, Central Community College has a large percentage of students who are in poverty, receive financial aid and rely on this aid to pay for courses. When implementing sustainability programs, we must keep these students in mind so that we do not add an additional burden to prevent them from achieving their educational goals. This session will focus on how we have accomplished projects to further sustainability while also keeping our lower income students in mind. Some of these projects include presentations directly geared towards saving money while being more sustainable, a no-cost bike share program, community and campus produce gardens, and community planning to support active transportation.",Central Community College,4372,,,,,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,,,,,"class issues,equity,affordability,low-income",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Olivia Whittaker,Environmental Sustainability Manager,Central Community College,4372,Liang O'Brien,"Sustainability Staff, Administrative Assistant",Central Community College,4372,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Whittaker_1420.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16186/0830_Whittaker_1420.pptx,,,,,,

Far from being a perfect formula, this session will unpack the challenges, strategies and various foci of taking such an approach in an effort to support campuses in their journey around socially just sustainability. More specifically, the Office of Sustainability at Auburn University will share their experience of co-creating social justice sustainability work on their campus, while an outside consultant will share her experiences helping campuses develop and utilize a social justice lens. The session uses a mix of content delivery, critical questioning, and group dialogue.

1903,Tokenism versus authentic inclusion: Evaluating equity efforts within sustainability programs,"Colleges and universities can be key players in increasing DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) in traditional environmental careers and pathways. But how well are we serving our students of color in this area and to what extent are we making progress towards achieving true equity? In this presentation, we will investigate concepts of authentic inclusion and how that may differ from superficial diversity efforts that focus simply on proportional representation and perhaps serve the university's needs more than the students. We will briefly review initiatives at UNC Asheville that make use of internships, fellowship programs, and multi-stakeholder collaboratives to achieve racially equitable participation, engagement and leadership within the environmental movement and discuss the impact of those programs to date. This information will be collaboratively presented by the Director of Sustainability who identifies as white and a student staff member in the office who identifies as a person of color.","University of North Carolina, Asheville",4237,,,,,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Campus Engagement,,,,,"tokenism,inclusion,racial & ethnic diversity,equity",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Sonia Marcus,Director of Sustainability,"University of North Carolina, Asheville",4237,Tamia Dame,Student Sustainability Staff,"University of North Carolina, Asheville",4237,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1970,Infusing Equity into the Future We Create,"How do we use our power within our institutions to help create a sustainable future for all, not just for some? Recognizing that climate change and economic transformation affects communities differently and identifying how current systems continue to perpetuate inequality is essential towards building an equitable and sustainable economy. As we help support and teach students to be transformative leaders, attention is needed to how equity is infused in our programming and curriculum. This session is centered around the concept of student development integrated with the belief that the work of equity, diversity, and inclusion is everyone's work every day. The Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota is grappling with how to transform our work so that diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is integrated into our work and into our processes. This case study offers examples of embedding equity into our daily work and also taking a more systemic look at curriculum. The processes for a recent mini-grant that funded a student to interview faculty members on environmental justice, staff members co-creating a DEI action plan, and social equity being infused into teaching modules are three recent experiences that will be offered as a starting point for participants to consider how they can take steps on their own campuses. This session will offer initial steps for those who are new to incorporating equity into their sustainability programming and an opportunity for those who are leading these efforts on their campuses to share resources and ideas with other participants. Takeaways for participants will include welcoming practices, co-creating with intentionality, and facilitation tools.","University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",0032,,,,,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"equity,diversity,inclusion",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Mary Hannemann,Sustainability Education Project Coordinator,"University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",0032,Beth Mercer-Taylor,"Director, Sustainability Education","University of Minnesota, Twin Cities",0032,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1901,Gender Pay Assessments Ensure Co-Created Economic Empowerment for Women Too,"No matter how you define it, women are generally paid less than men. In the United States, for example, the unadjusted average female's annual salary has commonly been cited as being 78% of the average male salary-- 80-98% for the adjusted average salary. Co-creating an equitable and sustainable economy requires addressing this pay gap, and universities can model best practices by submitting gender pay gap reporting and assessment as part of STARS. The Global Reporting Initiative has made the case for embedding gender in sustainability reporting. They recognize that stakeholders expect businesses to measure and report their gender impacts in part to capture the underestimated 'female economy.' In furtherance of SDG #5 (gender equality), by including this reporting in STARS, AASHE could incentivize all of its members, particularly private universities that are not subject to the same state disclosure requirements as public institutions, to disclose salary information-- making a positive contribution to gender equality and furthering a more equitable economy. In 2017, Inside Higher Ed reported that female administrators in higher education earn 80 cents on the dollar when compared to men---up by only 3 cents since 2001. The Chronicle of Higher Education reports on top executive compensation for public and private universities, of which fewer than 30% are women. However, obtaining information about compensation across the board is very difficult at non-public institutions. Shouldn't universities self-report like businesses in the GRI? By AASHE incorporating the SDGs into STARS, doesn't SDG #5 require gender pay assessments in order to implement the gender equality goal? This panel will review briefly background information about gender pay gap reporting, and the bulk of the time will be a facilitated discussion of how AASHE might incentivize universities to address gender equality through this or other reporting and assessment requirements.",Emory University,3931,Wake Forest University,0475,,,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Wellbeing & Work,Coordination & Planning,,,,"STARS,gender,pay equity,women,gender equality",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Ciannat Howett,Director of Sustainability,Emory University,3931,Dedee DeLongpre Johnston,Chief Sustainability Officer,Wake Forest University,0475,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Howett_1305.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16136/1445_Howett_1305.pptx,,,,,,
2028,The State of Race: Unpacking Racism in America Today,"As overt racism has intensified across America in recent years, it is important to have meaningful conversations that center race at AASHE. Diversity, inclusion, and equity initiatives are becoming popular in sustainability and must now move to explicitly address racism if we hope to realize a just society. Informed from a background in sociology that brings a unique perspective, we will explore racism from a structural lens utilizing three conceptual frameworks: the racialized social structure, the white racial frame, and color-blind racism. First, we will briefly explore the historical realities of a nation built on racism. Then, we will shift to understanding what structural racism is because it is vital to differentiate between individual racist actors and systematic injustice. While it is important to disrupt individual racist beliefs and actions, conceptualizing racism on a case-by-case basis obfuscates the real work of challenging and dismantling a system that provides unearned privileges or enacts unjust discrimination based on skin color. Focusing on individual racism has created a society where members of the white privileged class are often more concerned with being labeled racist, than the outcomes of a racist system or their part in buttressing it. Throughout the session, we will use current events in the media, politics, popular culture, and sports to unpack the realities of racism. Ultimately, racism is a system that allows the elite ruling class to subjugate and divide us from each other, and while its impacts are much worse for people of color, in the end, it hurts us all.",Texas A&M University,7982,,,,,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Public Engagement,,,,,"institutional racism,equity",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Ben Kalscheur,Sustainability Assistant Manager,Texas A&M University,7982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Kalscheur_1550.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16539/1100_Kalscheur_1550.pdf,,,,,,
2449,Institutionalizing Environmental Justice,"Are you looking to implement environmental justice at your campus but unsure how to start? How can environmental justice programs and services be institutionalized in higher education? Over the past few years, the Student Environmental Resource Center (SERC) and The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) have been working to institutionalize environmental justice operations, programs, and projects for the campus community. In this session, student and staff panelists will present on the following programs and projects SERC has adopted and developed to address the demands for more integration of social and environmental justice programs and resources on campus: 1) The Environmental Justice Associate, a student staff position dedicated to creating programs and services for UCB community on issues of social equity and environmental justice. 2) Decolonize the Environment: A Series of Workshops on Environmental Intersectionality; 3) TGIF's Environmental Justice Grant Program; 4) Environmental Justice at-Large Representative, a student representative position on TGIF's governing Committee; 5) The Environmental Justice Resource Folder, a growing collection of articles, toolkits, activities, books, videos on environmental justice; and 6) SERC's 5-year Strategic Plan, a living document that outlines SERC's goals around diversity, equity, and inclusion. Presenters will discuss how each program began, how it developed, and challenges faced. Presenters will also deconstruct topics such as: an intersectionality framework and justice- washing in the context of environmental sustainability. All projects and programs mentioned were rooted in, in collaboration with, and inspired by the work of the Students of Color Environmental Collective (SCEC) at UCB.","University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"environmental justice,racial & ethnic diversity,equity,inclusion",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Sharon Daraphonhdeth,"Director, Student Environmental Resource Center","University of California, Berkeley",4473,Colette Cosyn,Student,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Daraphonhdeth_1686.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17997/1530_Daraphonhdeth_1686.pdf,,,,,,
2293,Niizhoo-gwayakochigewin: Two Ways of Making Things Right,"Named for an Ojibwe phrase which translates to 'two ways of making things right,' Niizhoo-gwayakochigewin draws from Bemidji State University's (BSU) Sustainability Office, Department of Languages and Indigenous Studies, Department of Environmental Studies, and American Indian Resource Center to create a single co-curricular program that brings Indigenous perspectives into sustainability initiatives. As part of this program, BSU has five clear objectives which include creating a new academic major, organizing faculty development workshops, creating a community collaborative to guide the initiatives, managing an undergraduate summer internship program, and hiring two graduate assistants to help facilitate all objectives. The undergraduates will be charged with identifying and pursuing collaboration opportunities between the program and local communities, while the graduate students will provide leadership in the program during the academic year. The Center for Sustainability Studies and Indigenous Studies Department at Bemidji State University propose an interdisciplinary Indigenous Sustainability Studies (ISS) major and minor to begin the Fall of 2019. While there is one similar program in Canada - the Indigenous Environmental Studies/Science Program at Trent University - in the United States, degree programs that combine Indigenous perspectives with Western knowledge are rare. Indigenous knowledge perspectives will become more legitimized alongside Western worldviews, a change that is crucial for the long-term paradigm shift that this degree program intends to bring about. All Bemidji State University students, American Indian and non-American Indian alike, will begin to appreciate and use the multiple worldviews provided by understanding both Western and Indigenous knowledge perspectives to help bring about creative problem solving and long-term, sustainable changes in the world.",Bemidji State University,4554,,,,,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,Curriculum,,Sustainability Studies & Science,,,indigenous focus,10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Erika Bailey-Johnson,Sustainability Director,Bemidji State University,4554,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_BaileyJohnson_1710.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17309/1530_BaileyJohnson_1710.pdf,,,,,,
2107,"Exploring Allyship and Connections Between Sustainability, Diversity & Inclusion & Social Justice","No one inherently knows everything about diversity and inclusion work, but this work can also be a challenging place to experiment, because mistakes hurt others and in this space, impact is valued over intention. How do we create inclusive learning spaces that build trust, while ensuring an environment that prioritizes learning and inspires taking responsibility for personal growth? Better understanding, supporting, and addressing social sustainability and the connections between sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in higher education is paramount in creating institutions that welcome and nurture intellectual and personal growth among a diverse campus community. The Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Committee of the AASHE Advisory Council invites attendees to join this networking session for a discussion on allyship, the different dimensions of diversity, and the connections that can be drawn between social justice and sustainability work on campuses. This meeting will begin with a short introduction from the committee about our group and work, followed by small table discussions and activities exploring the connections between sustainability and various social justice issues and attendees varying dimensions of diversity. Then we will reconvene and share among the larger group. Members of the D&I Committee will facilitate each table. To start the conversation, they will share their own insights, then facilitate open and respectful dialogue inspired by the mapping and diversity dimensions activities.

The AASHE Advisory Council's Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Committee invites you to join a panel on integrating social justice and connecting sustainability to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts on campus and in your community. Where can we draw easy connections, and which ones are more difficult? How do we leverage connections to build systems for change? The committee will begin with an introduction about our work and follow with sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion case study presentations. We'll end by inviting you to share your story of mapping sustainability, diversity & inclusion and social justice connections. Portland Community College's students restructured the Green Initiative Fund to clearly support ecosocial justice, resulting in multiple ecosocial justice trainings at the college and in the community. University of Illinois Chicago is creating the UIC Heritage Garden, a hands-on learning project where student interns work with staff and community members to connect horticulture with environmental sustainability, cultural diversity and social justice. Then we'll learn how Georgia Institute of Technology's Serve-Learn-Sustain program works across the university to integrate sustainability into curriculum, with a focus on social sustainability and a partnership with the Institute Diversity office, engaging underrepresented students in their new Living Building through the equity petal.

1855,"No Sustainable Economy Without Conversations About 'Unsustainable' Race, Class & Gender Privilege","While attention to the ways dynamics of racism, classism and gender oppression target people of color and native people, poor and working class people, and cisgender women and trans* people is critically important to our sustainability work, too often the 'other side' of these dynamics are left invisible and thus unchallenged and unchanged. More specifically, while some campuses are willing to consider the impacts of racism, sexism or classism on their sustainability work, less frequent is the willingness to look at the ways white, owning-class and male privilege has impacted that work. As we attempt to build a sustainable economy, critical dialogue and action regarding economic, gender and race privilege must be part of that process lest it be incomplete and yield only partial results. This session, which is best suited for individuals who have at least some prior training in diversity, equity, and inclusion issues, is designed to help participants dive more deeply into the complicated and often fraught conversation about class, race and gender privilege in the service of developing more collaborative campus sustainability efforts. To be sure, this is not a session mired in guilt, shame and blame. Instead, it will: Establish a shared understanding of how systems of oppression work and their impacts on climate change, environmental issues and sustainability work; Explore, through a social justice lens, the dynamics of privilege inherent in all of these systems of oppression; Identify the unconscious and unintentional ways race, class and gender privilege thwart collective sustainability work on our campuses; Suggest ways to interrupt and dismantle these privileged dynamics; and then Connect this social justice work to the creation of effective and forward-thinking campus sustainability efforts.",Hackman Consulting Group,5108,,,,,,,,,,,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,,"class issues,gender,privilege,white privilege,institutional racism",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Heather Hackman,Founder and President,Hackman Consulting Group,5108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Roadmap provided a comprehensive review of strategies to make the campus more sustainable and reduce their carbon footprint by meeting the 40% GHG reduction target by 2030 (2007 baseline). The presentation will review the history of energy efficiency and sustainability efforts from 2007 at St. John's prior to the preparation of the Roadmap in 2017-2018. The pre-Roadmap efforts included a campus-wide lighting upgrade project, lab hood efficiency upgrades, and efficiency upgrades to the campus chilled water systems. The Roadmap efforts explored commercially ready technologies and controls to reduce the energy requirements at St. John's University. Project efforts reviewed boiler plant and steam system upgrades, chiller plant and chilled water system upgrades, and HVAC equipment and controls upgrades. The Roadmap also considered solar PV for the dormitory buildings with south-facing roofs and along with carport parking. Since the issuance of the Roadmap in 2018 co-funded by NYSERDA, the University has embarked upon upgrading the main steam boiler plant and has planned for a chilled water plant upgrade. The University is also planning to study the potential for geothermal or ground-source heating and cooling for the dormitory buildings and compare against other upgrade options. The presentation will provide attendees the information needed to start the development of a Roadmap for their campus and meet sustainability goals set by the administration. The Roadmap is a critical item to complete that will evaluate multiple technologies and strategies to find the optimal solution to meet each individual campus' goals. Lesson learned will be shared by the campus sustainability director and their consultant used to develop the Roadmap.",Antares Group Inc.,9529,"St. John's University, New York",0456,,,,,,,,,Energy,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"energy reduction,master plans",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,James Olmsted,Senior Project Engineer,Antares Group Inc.,9529,Thomas Goldsmith,Director of Energy & Sustainability,"St. John's University, New York",0456,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Olmsted_1507.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17237/1530_Olmsted_1507.pdf,,,,,,
2136,Committing your campus to 100% renewable energy,"It's 2019. We have the power to harness clean, abundant energy from the sun and the wind, and we can do it more efficiently and cheaply than ever before. Yet we're still producing, consuming and wasting energy in ways that do lasting damage to our environment and our health -- fracking for gas near schools instead of putting solar panels on their roofs; drilling for oil near beaches instead of harnessing the winds that blow offshore; and burning coal, oil and gas instead of powering our homes, cars and lives with clean, renewable energy. America's over 5,000 universities, colleges and community colleges are big energy consumers, with large buildings, many of which are open 24/7. At the same time, college campuses are largely self-contained communities, and therefore better able to find ways to generate all the power they need from clean, renewable sources -- especially given the expertise among their faculty and the enthusiasm among their students for going green. The University of California, Cornell University, and Vanderbilt University are among the campuses that already have committed to going 100 percent renewable. To tackle climate change and stop the use of dirty and dangerous fossil fuels, we need more colleges and universities leading the charge to 100 percent renewable energy. In this workshop, we will train students to run smart, strategic campaigns for 100 percent renewable energy on campus that allow them to work in partnership with campus administrations. This workshop will consist of overviews, interactive small groups and a case study of a successful campaign that has been won on a campus.",Environment America,8302,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Campus Engagement,,,,,"renewable energy,student leadership,outreach campaigns",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Bronte Payne,"Director, 100% Renewable Campuses",Environment America,8302,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2529,Incorporating Stakeholder Values: Assessing Renewable Energy Options at Portland State University,"To determine options for renewable energy development and procurement, the Campus Sustainability Office at Portland State University (PSU) turned to it's Living Lab program to engage students in this key area of climate action planning and utility management. Over the course of two student projects - an undergraduate business capstone and environmental management master's project - University staff and decision-makers have a stronger understanding of options for increasing renewable energy use on campus and how these options fit with campus stakeholder values. This presentation will describe the project recently completed by a PSU environmental science and management graduate student (now sustainability office staff) to conduct a values-based assessment of PSU's renewable energy development and procurement options. The goal of this presentation is to demonstrate how students can offer consulting-like services to colleges and universities in renewable energy planning and offer this project as a case study for other institutions to model in their work to determine renewable energy options. In addition to focusing on process, key outcomes of each project stage will be reviewed. Project stages and process that will be covered include: identifying options through external informational interviews and review of state-level utility regulation; review of current purchased electricity practices and providers; internal stakeholder meetings to clearly define institutional renewable energy goals and identify and weight values-based decision-making criteria; iterative recommendation development; and presentation of potential renewable energy pathways.",Portland State University,2515,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Campus Engagement,Coordination & Planning,,,,"student engagement,living labs,stakeholder engagement,renewable energy",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Emily Quinton,Sustainability Education & Outreach Coordinator,Portland State University,2515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Quinton_1721.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18364/1530_Quinton_1721.pdf,,,,,,
2048,Lots of Watts: Building an Energy Cohort to Buy Big Renewables,"As campuses face climate action targets, or seek to manage energy budgets, large-scale renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs) have emerged as a practical and cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gasses while creating budget certainty and mitigating energy price risk. However, many campuses face challenges pursuing renewables, including a scale mismatch between campus energy load and renewable energy project sizes and, as importantly, difficulty gaining traction with campus stakeholders around renewable energy solutions. As a result, numerous renewable energy-buying cohorts have emerged to help achieve the scale needed to achieve attractive economics, including lower PPA prices, and better risk-adjusted contract terms, while leveraging the group to build momentum and confidence to act. Attendees will learn best practices for renewable energy PPAs, including the multifold economic, risk-management, reputational and academic benefits that can be used to engage campus stakeholders in supporting an aggregation strategy. We will examine the benefits of this approach by studying the Pennsylvania Higher Ed Consortium, a group that includes Lehigh University, Lafayette College, Muhlenberg College, and Swarthmore College, aimed at providing electricity from 100% renewable energy sources for its members. PHEC has faced challenges along the way, some of which were avoided, and others which needed close management. The effort required strategic stakeholder engagement, but also needed strict scheduling in order to keep progress on track. The participating institutions had to agree in advance on criteria that required consensus, such as project location requirements, while understanding how other project criteria could be individually negotiated, e.g. REC treatment, and contract duration.

1914,Partners in Greening the Economy: Clean Energy and Electrification on Campus and in the Community,"For sustainability, we collectively need to green our economy to improve environmental and human health and wellbeing. One aspect of this larger process is to shift to clean energy sources and push for electrification of our systems and equipment. Weber State University in Ogden, Utah (a politically very conservative state), signed on to the American Colleges and University Presidents' Climate Commitment in 2007. Since then the university has pursued a strategy to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 (on track for 2040), starting with the low-hanging fruit of energy efficiency and conservation. From that early start a four-point plan is now in operation on campus: 1) Energy Conservation & Efficiency First, 2) Electrification of Everything, 3) Source Renewably (with as much on-site generation as possible), and 4) Reinvest and Repeat. Over the past 11 years, WSU has reduced its electricity consumption by 27%, its natural gas consumption by 29%, and its direct carbon footprint by over 30%, while the university has grown by more than 603,183 square feet. Savings to date are $11,702,275. In addition to a focus on campus operations, the institution's sustainability units in Facilities Management and Academic Affairs have together offered community programs focused on renewable energy and electrification (vehicles and landscape equipment), and geared toward the complementary goals of improving air quality and reducing carbon emissions. Noteworthy among these has been a partnership with surrounding county health departments, now being replicated at the state level. This case study session will provide details of the four-point carbon reduction plan and these community programs and partnerships, all of which could be replicated at other institutions, scales and in other contexts.",Weber State University,4562,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Air & Climate,Public Engagement,,,,"electrification,renewable energy,clean energy,energy conservation",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Alice Mulder,Associate Professor/Dir Sustainability Center,Weber State University,4562,Jennifer Bodine,Sustainability Manager,Weber State University,4562,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Bodine_1397.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16173/1445_Bodine_1397.pptx,,,,,,

1908,Exploring Deep Decarbonization on a Research Intensive Campus,"Caltech is a private research university located in Pasadena, California, whose mission is to expand human knowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education. For the past decade, Caltech has reduced costs, met campus energy requirements, and pursued greenhouse gas emissions targets through efficient energy generation, energy conservation, and procurement of alternative and low carbon energy sources. These efforts have flattened energy demand growth and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 23% despite expanding campus space and increasing research intensity. However, as the Institute looks to the future, continuing to meet campus energy requirements in an economical manner while remaining sensitive to environmental concerns, ensuring reliability and maintaining adaptive capacity will become increasingly complex. In 2015, Caltech set out to develop an energy supply strategy that addressed these challenges and quickly discovered that a more in-depth evaluation of utility infrastructure would be needed to enable the campus to meet future energy needs, prepare for the integration of off-site renewable electricity, and address emissions from thermal energy generation. Over the past year and a half, Caltech has worked with Affiliated Engineers, Inc., to develop a comprehensive Utility System Master Plan that will be deployed in concert with the Institute's Energy Resource Strategy to usher in Caltech's energy future. This session will walk through the scope of the Master Plan, the collaborative process employed by AEI and Caltech, the tools and techniques used to evaluate the options, and the tradeoffs that a research-intensive campus faces when evaluating deep decarbonization of its energy systems.","Affiliated Engineers, Inc.",7037,California Institute of Technology,1192,,,,,,,,,Energy,Air & Climate,,,,,"energy reduction,master plans,decarbonization",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Buss Price,Energy & Utilities Market Leader,"Affiliated Engineers, Inc.",7037,Max Christman,Sustainability Manager,California Institute of Technology,1192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Price_1380.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16156/0830_Price_1380.pptx,,,,,,
2051,Energizing a Growing Urban Campus: Taking Data to Implement Energy Savings & Sustainability at UW Tacoma,"How do you take conventional building system surveys, upgrades and sub-metering data to the next level: comprehensive energy savings and genuine campus sustainability? How can you empower meaningful sustainability stewardship on campus for the long haul? In this session, we'll explore the unique revitalization of the University of Washington Tacoma (UWT). Once an abandoned warehouse district in Tacoma, this group of historical buildings was thoroughly and thoughtfully renovated and is now a growing urban and community hub of higher learning. We'll explore the benefits of: 1) Addressing emerging legislative mandates and social demands to address climate change through carbon neutral/zero energy construction, energy efficient buildings, modernization of infrastructure and building resiliency-while keeping education affordable along with funding challenges and options. 2) Using data and key performance indicators (KPIs) to identify opportunities for energy savings and sustainability-strategically converting data into something useful. 3) Providing hands-on learning laboratories for students and 'bridging the gap' by aligning public and private interests to benefit students and the larger community. Through Active Energy Management and innovative data visualization, UWT is taking conventional conservation work to the next level by acting on building trends and sub-meter data. Learn how Facility Condition Assessments-coupled with innovative data visualizations-can unlock substantial energy savings on any campus. Lastly, we'll discuss 'Sustainability in Action,' a course at UWT providing students with hands-on project experience in the development and implementation of sustainable solutions. In this class, students develop ideas for greening their campus and make them actionable and beneficial for the campus.","University of Washington, Tacoma",7862,McKinstry,8668,,,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Curriculum,,,,"energy management,energy metering,performance indicators,data,project based learning",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Stanley Joshua,Sustainability Staff,"University of Washington, Tacoma",7862,LeAnn Scalzo,Sr Account Executive,McKinstry,8668,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Scalzo_1750.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16636/1100_Scalzo_1750.pdf,,,,,,
1994,An In-House Energy Dashboard: Challenges and Achievements from Oregon State University,"Digital energy dashboards have proven to be a convenient tool for energy data management, analysis and reporting. Dashboard software can be leveraged to not only support campus operations, but also community-based programs or behavior-change campaigns. Proprietary dashboard solutions are often relatively expensive and may not provide the flexibility and scalability demanded by higher ed institutions. After licensing two different off-the-shelf dashboards, Oregon State University determined that an in-house energy dashboard solution was necessary. The OSU Sustainability Office partnered with a senior capstone course to begin development, then hired two student employees to continue the project. Over the past two years, the Office created a custom dashboard solution that provides interactive data visualization and real-time reporting for over 28 buildings. Data collection, management, and visualization are all accomplished in-house. Facility operators now have a convenient tool for 15-minute interval data analysis, and residence hall Eco-Reps can utilize the software to promote enriched co-curricular experiences for students like energy saving competitions. Using their experience building the OSU Energy Dashboard (dashboard.sustainability.oregonstate.edu) presenters will explain how to kickstart a custom dashboard project. They will cover where to find the necessary resources, how to overcome common development challenges and strategies for managing software projects. This presentation is tailored for individuals with little software development experience, but the presenters are prepared to answer highly technical questions about implementation.

2199,Energy Performance Improvement: Energy Savings and Occupant Awareness Program at Texas A&M University,"Utilities & Energy Services (UES) Division at Texas A&M University strives to bridge the gap between implementing energy conservation measures and its success through increasing occupant engagement and empowerment. UES created the Energy Performance Improvement (EPI) Program to create awareness among the building occupants regarding building energy use, involve them in identifying and implementing energy conservation measures, and instill a sense of ownership of an energy efficient building through financial incentives. The EPI program has two primary objectives: 1). Raise awareness and identify opportunities for improved efficiency and sustainability through engagement with facility occupants and stakeholders and 2). Implement energy system technical solutions, with occupant engagement and participation, to improve facility operating efficiency and reduce energy consumption and cost. To assess the effectiveness of the EPI Program, a pilot program was created in February 2017 for four buildings on campus that were recently constructed and accommodate departments with diverse operating capabilities. The active phase of the program varied for the four buildings so that the available resources could be effectively utilized and the efficiency of the EPI Program was verified at each step. The intention of the pilot program was to engage the building occupants in energy conservation related decisions and identify areas of energy savings even in the newer buildings with latest equipment & control systems, consisting of various occupancy and operation types. At the end of the pilot program, the four buildings were able to save a total of $499,800 in energy costs, thus deeming the EPI Program successful in engaging and empowering building occupants as a crucial component in operating highly energy efficient buildings. Based on the success of the pilot program, an expanded EPI program will be implemented starting 2019.",Texas A&M University,7982,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,Campus Engagement,,,,"energy reduction,building occupants,occupant engagement",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Sai Brindha Kapalayam,Energy Analyst,Texas A&M University,7982,Christopher Dieckert,Supervisor of Energy Performance Improvement,Texas A&M University,7982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Kapalayam_1796.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17050/0830_Kapalayam_1796.pptx,,,,,,
2445,Using Technology to Achieve Sustainability,"Numerous academic and residential buildings, thousands of people subsisting together, and various facilities to support the establishment, it won't be wrong to compare a college campus to a small town. Thousands of these 'small towns' across the country substantially consume electricity, water, and various other natural resources on a regular basis. However, most institutions lack the adequate resources and technology to measure and tabulate their own campus operations. Stanford University and MIT are two institutions that have a well-established sustainability dashboard in practice that effectively tracks their campus facilities. Multiple dashboards for measuring each facility on campus - energy and water use, greenhouse gas emissions, waste diversion, etc. - make it easier to collect and visualize campus performance metrics. This greatly helps facilities managers identify opportunities for improvement. I believe every college campus in the country should implement such a system. Through my poster, I shall highlight the major features of these individual dashboards, the technology behind it, and empirically explain how campuses can benefit from it. The extracted data per building - square footage, energy utilization, etc. - fed into a visual analytics software, such as tableau, can create databases and spreadsheets easily understandable for all. Imagine this data analysis system being emulated by each city, county, and state in the country that collects and visualizes facilities data. An amalgamation of this aggregated data can create a centralized source for sustainability-related data, helping balance the triple bottom line. I am trying to implement the idea of 'campus as a living lab' at the University of Mississippi for my honors thesis project by creating such a dashboard, which can also help us answer some of the most complex questions in sustainability.

2014,Campus Energy Master Planning: Innovations and Best Practices,"Hundreds of colleges and universities have publicly committed to carbon neutrality, with over 120 targets in the next 15 years. How are schools addressing often the largest source of emissions: building energy consumption? The U.S. Department of Energy's Better Buildings Initiative will present research and findings gleaned from analysis of over 50 leading campus energy, climate, and sustainability master plans including best practices, common pitfalls, and innovative new ideas. Michigan State University will discuss their Integrated Energy Planning Model (IEPM), a software tool that informed energy-related decisions on campus. The model took into account the complex nature of energy use at a research institution and the impacts of key metrics such as utility costs, tuition, greenhouse gas emissions, debt capacity, and more. The IEPM was used not just by the Energy Team, but also by students, professors, administrators, and community members to guide MSU's long-term energy approach. The IEPM informed the development of MSU's Energy Transition Plans. Lastly, Stanford University will present on their Energy and Climate Plan. A key component of the plan is the first district-level heat-recovery facility in the world - Stanford Energy System innovations. The plan not only represents the most economical energy options, but also immediately reduces campus GHG emissions 68% and potable water use by 15%.

Internships may be conducted on or off campus, with a faculty advisor monitoring progress and experiential learning goals. Capstone projects must be conducted on campus or in the local community and incorporate 3+ years of study and experience in Environmental Studies. Graduating senior, Riley Francis, completed multiple internships with StraightUp Solar in Bloomington, IL, after completing her Solar PV training (outside of campus studies and at an offsite location). Following her internships, Riley began working part-time with StraightUp Solar and was able to incorporate her experience into a unique capstone project exploring the financial and logistical feasibility of solar panel installations on Eureka College's campus (various rooftop locations). Solar energy systems are a potential investment opportunity for Eureka College to lower campus greenhouse gas emissions, save financially through tax cuts, rebates, and energy savings from day one, create new marketing opportunities, and make a commitment to a better environment; all while supporting the college's core value of 'Sustainability and Stewardship'. The feasibility analysis was supported with solar programming support from StraightUp Solar and included the following: - Assessment of rooftop suitability using solar system design tool, Helioscope - Prediction of energy costs and savings (including future inflation rates) using electricity database tool, Energy Toolbase - Creation of a financial model for each recommended rooftop installation site (5 buildings) to provide an accurate estimate of total installation cost (including soft costs), using Straight Up Solar's V4 pricing tool - Calculate potential avoidable GHG emissions using National Renewable Energy Laboratory Data",Eureka College,4079,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Curriculum,,,,,"solar,renewable energy,capstone experience,internships",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Katy Everett,Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies,Eureka College,4079,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1973,Understanding Decision Making for Building Energy Efficiency at a Higher Education Institution,"The built environment provides significant opportunities to lower greenhouse gas emissions by increasing energy efficiency (EE). In the United States, campuses have been major beneficiaries of EE programs and services. The higher education sector exhibits multiple favorable but unique attributes, including access to capital, decision makers' motivations beyond the financial bottom line, and control of multiple buildings that are energy intensive, such as laboratories, medical research facilities, sports facilities, and food services. The decision to retrofit involves many stakeholders and aspects that are interrelated. This study aims to understand the decision-making processes in EE projects at a higher education institution, particularly the exhaustive list of factors that decision makers consider and their interrelationships. Using semi-structured interviews of facilities managers and secondary data from reports and policy documents, researchers conducted a case study at a large, higher education institution. Factors were categorized into five major categories: economic feasibility, environmental impact, institutional characteristics, occupant impact, and technical practicality. Interactions among factors are depicted in a causal loop diagram that shows cause-effect relationships. Three main loops highlight the major concerns-economic feasibility, occupant impact, and technical practicality.","University of Washington, Seattle",4030,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,,,,,"energy efficiency,built environment",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Lysandra Medal,Ph.D. Student,"University of Washington, Seattle",4030,Amy Kim,Assistant Professor,"University of Washington, Seattle",4030,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Medal_1739.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16324/1445_Medal_1739.pdf,,,,,,
2044,On the Cutting Edge: Great Results From New Approaches to Behavioral Change Cues,"The next frontier in energy efficiency is occupants and how they interact with the buildings. Once we have the prescriptive things like codes and building envelopes done, it's about how occupants can impact the building performance by up to 30%. In the United States, buildings account for nearly 60 percent of electricity consumption, and according to the EPA, up to 30 percent of electricity is inefficiently or unnecessarily used. Today's student population communicates differently than previous generations and understanding their information preferences and sources is key to impactful message content and messaging methods. Today's technology allows building owners and operators to move beyond the static display of energy data to engage occupants, and accurately measure the impact of their building design, messaging content and messaging methods for increased energy efficient behaviors. How people receive, retain and act on information has rapidly evolved. In this session, you will hear how university staff, students and an architect are cutting emissions levels and driving new levels of energy efficiency by rethinking behavioral change cues.

2074,Low Carbon Electrification,"As Institutions across North America continue to expand, they are struggling to meet greenhouse gas reduction targets due to the significant capital investments required for net zero construction. Many institutions have also completed numerous energy conservation retrofits on existing buildings and are now finding it difficult to find additional cost effective GHG savings. Thompson Rivers University (TRU) has recently built a new Industrial Trades and Technology Center (ITTC) using low carbon electrification as the energy source for heating. The ITTC heating plant was designed to also heat the adjacent Trades and Technology building that had been using natural gas for its heat source. The ITTC low carbon heating plant has resulted in a 10 percent reduction in GHG emissions on campus, indicating a cost effective way to reduce GHG emissions in spite of additional growth. When compared to conventional natural gas heating, the centralized electric boiler plant is reducing the total carbon emissions by over 250,000 kg of CO2 annually. The TRU Williams Lake campus recently converted to a combination of biomass and low carbon electricity as its primary heating source. The case study at Williams Lake has resulted in GHG emissions reductions of more than 90 percent. This strategy is way more cost effective than any other energy conservation measures for the other existing buildings do to the fact they have been through 3 or 4 retro-fits already. Over the next 3-4 years TRU will replicate the ITTC and Williams lake examples for other building, resulting in GHG emissions reductions of 70-90 percent compared to the 2011 baseline. A campus-wide study has indicated that it is possible to phase out natural gas boilers in each major building and retrofit with low carbon electric heat pumps and boilers. As heating buildings is the primary source of GHG emissions, low carbon electrification has been adopted as the most important strategy towards achieving GHG reduction targets.",Thompson Rivers University,1431,Creative Energy,9510,,,,,,,,,Energy,Buildings,,,,,"electrification,power plants,energy reduction",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Jim Gudjonson,"Director, Sustainability Office",Thompson Rivers University,1431,Natalie Yao,Energy Specialist,Thompson Rivers University,1431,Diego Mandelbaum,Vice President,Creative Energy,9510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Mandelbaum_1554.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18268/1400_Mandelbaum_1554.pdf,,,,,,

A creative approach was needed to evaluate potential energy savings from envelope retrofits for 56 buildings across a campus portfolio, and to further validate those savings through more detailed energy modeling for a subset of buildings. The results are a quantified prioritization of potential envelope retrofits based on high level energy savings estimates (UA heat loss) for 56 buildings across campus, with a deeper dive on higher priority buildings using archetype building models. The savings estimates were coordinated with the envelope assessments, and the prioritization was aligned between energy and other criteria. Performance was benchmarked against metrics soon to be incorporated into the British Columbia Energy Step Code (TEDI and EUI) for college buildings. Findings suggested that improvements to the building envelope were not cost effective based on early retirement scenarios, due to a combination of relatively low energy costs, modest carbon taxes, and a mild coastal climate. However, economics improved when based on end-of-life incremental cost of envelope components that were better than those required by the building code, and by incorporating future carbon tax projections.

2373,Vampire Energy Slayers 2.0,"The Vampire Energy Slayers program was first developed at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). At the University of San Diego, we have embraced the program and aim to quantify the results. The program aims to raise awareness of vampire energy consumption. Vampire energy accounts for over 10% of the electrical consumption of a typical campus, so reducing these loads can create considerable GHG and financial savings. Through this student-led guerilla marketing campaign, we have increased awareness of this issue; now we hope to show that awareness has translated into results. Students serve as vampire energy 'Slayers' on days designated by the Sustainability Office. Slayers seek out instances of vampire energy in selected buildings and give a brief overview of vampire energy to occupants. Should an occupant not be present, Slayers place 'tickets' on offending appliances. The tickets incorporate humor and education to inform the device owner about vampire energy. Prior to their visits, Slayers learn about vampire energy, its causes, and the benefits of reducing it. They also receive instruction on respecting work environments; Slayers are encouraged to turn off lights in unoccupied areas and computer monitors in common spaces, but personal electronic devices are off-limits. USD Vampire Energy Slayers enjoyed a successful pilot season, with students 'slaying' on 22 days in mid-October through early November. Slayers reached 250 employees in seven campus buildings, identifying a total of 455 instances of vampire energy; 77% of offices had 2 or fewer devices. The program will be replicated in Spring 2019 so that we can track if vampire energy consumption has been reduced due to the program, and we intend to share these results in our presentation.",University of San Diego,2897,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Campus Engagement,,,Sustainability Office,,"energy reduction,vampire energy,outreach campaigns",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Trey McDonald,Director of Sustainability,University of San Diego,2897,Alison Sanchirico,Sustainability Coordinator,University of San Diego,2897,Savannah Robledo,Student - Special Projects Intern,University of San Diego,2897,Rachel Sarner,Student,University of San Diego,2897,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_McDonald_1628.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17516/1100_McDonald_1628.pdf,,,,,,
1938,"Data, Data, Data: Longitudinal Importance of Assessing Student Energy Behaviors","UMass Dartmouth has partnered with NORESCO for eight years on a behavior change program called Energy Conservation Through Behavior Change® as a part of a larger energy savings project. The initial energy savings project focused on the retrofit improvements of campus facilities: involving lights, heating and cooling, and water system improvements to reduce the water and energy usage of the university, which in turn helped to reduce carbon emissions. Once a new energy utilization baseline was created post construction, the behavior change program engaged to guarantee $62,681 in annual cost savings. This partnership is unique in how it has maintained communications and efforts to collect and study longitudinal data for nearly a decade to make impactful decisions about energy conservation behaviors. By analyzing and comparing the metered data of water and energy consumption at the university to collected results from the student surveys, NORESCO and UMass Dartmouth have been able to identify trends and changes in student opinions which allows for the program to adapt and align with intrinsic motivations of the students to maintain and meet the annual guaranteed savings. This program involves surveying students at the beginning and end of the fall semester regarding their attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors regarding their personal energy and water use and campus recycling. By tracking the longitudinal data from self-reported student surveys, we have found support that the behavior change efforts of the university are economically and environmentally impactful.",University of Massachusetts Dartmouth,0648,Noresco,2059,,,,,,,,,Energy,Campus Engagement,,,,,"data,behavior change,outreach campaigns,energy reduction",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Jamie Jacquart,Assistant Director of Campus Sustainability,University of Massachusetts Dartmouth,0648,Adam Mazza,Green Operations Specialist,Noresco,2059,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Mazza_1574.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16231/1400_Mazza_1574.pptx,,,,,,
2376,Making the Case for Campus-Wide Energy Monitoring and Student-Led Initiatives for Implementation,"We present the case for campus-wide energy monitoring, a community-engaged energy dashboard, and how these initiatives become feasible with student leadership. At Creighton University, we have developed a holistic, detailed, and actively monitored energy monitoring system, including nearly 50 buildings and their individual control systems. The end results required student input and involvement, as well as University and key stakeholder sponsorship. Monitoring with purpose allows us to address carbon neutrality goals and validate ROIs for deferred maintenance projects. It is easy to focus on building sustainability during new construction when donor interest and campus attention is high. However, by utilizing energy monitoring in existing buildings to identify deficiencies, campuses can reduce energy waste, quickly identify financial savings, and communicate any renewable energy production. By monitoring energy infrastructure at all scales, as well as controlling and promoting energy curtailment, it serves to make the invisible problem of energy management more visible. This case study follows the students' journey through the process of implementation, from developing marketing strategies to creating data-driven reports that aid in energy curtailment, and directly maintaining and monitoring control systems. Our student-designed energy dashboard directly engages our campus community through energy reduction competitions, energy education, and increasing awareness of energy costs. The outcomes of this initiative are relevant work experience for students, better justified maintenance requests, and making the case for renewable energy solutions, including on and off campus projects. In our case, solutions include an actively monitored 98-kW solar array in the Dominican Republic and 120-kW of solar on our campus. We also present an effective small-scale case study as a tangible guide for students to initiate the conversation about energy monitoring on their campus.",Creighton University,4738,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Campus Engagement,,,,,"monitoring,dashboards,energy use",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Colin Thomas,Student,Creighton University,4738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Thomas_1662.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17528/1100_Thomas_1662.pdf,,,,,,

This is achieved through encouraging behavior changes of the people who live and work in these facilities. It is a program that originated at IU Bloomington 10 years ago - with the conclusion of the most recent challenge achieving savings of 760,314 KWh of electricity and 877,416 gallons of water. Following in the footsteps of IU Bloomington, a Greening IUPUI Grant was written by a student in 2017 that successfully funded the development of IUPUI's own Energy Challenge. The inaugural challenge was between residence life on campus - consisting of Ball Hall, University Tower, and North Hall. In its first year, the Energy Challenge resulted in energy savings of 38,408.8 KWh and established a new program on campus further enhancing the culture of sustainability that the IUPUI Sustainability Office strives to achieve.",Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI),1353,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Campus Engagement,,,,,"outreach campaigns,competitions,energy reduction,behavior change",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Dylan Patterson,Student,Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI),1353,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2062,Economically and Environmentally Sustainable Utilities and Energy,"Texas A&M University (TAMU) in College Station, Texas is one of the largest universities in the country, experiencing significant growth while fulfilling a mission of world class teaching, research, and service. With 2018-19 student population over 69,000, campus size over 5,200 acres, and annual research budget over $900 million, TAMU is also ranked as one of the best values in higher education. Utilities & Energy Services (UES) serves over 30 million GSF of building space at TAMU, providing a comprehensive array of utilities and energy services, operating seven utility plants to provide generation and distribution of electricity, chilled and heating hot water (for cooling and heating), steam, and domestic cold and hot water. Other services provided include storm water, sanitary sewer, waste water treatment, solid waste & recycling services, and building automation for environmental/climate control of all conditioned spaces. Energy procurement includes the purchase of electricity and natural gas to effectively operate a highly efficient combined heat and power (CHP) system and reliably serve campus energy requirements. A 15-year commitment has been made, starting in 2022, to purchase almost one quarter of campus electrical power from a renewable solar source, while cost avoiding over $1 million annually. A comprehensive operational plan and master plan has invested significantly since 2002 to improve the safety, reliability, and efficiency of utility production facilities, distribution systems, and building operation. Over the past 16 years, square footage served at TAMU has increased by over 60 percent while total energy consumption has decreased over 20 percent, resulting in almost $250 million in cost avoidance and a 50 percent reduction in energy use intensity (energy consumed per GSF).

On-site installations will not achieve ambitious carbon reduction goals. Six Milwaukee institutions and government agencies banded together to build their capacity for garnering large scale renewable energy with the local, regulated utility. Through the sustainability, legal, and financial expertise of UW-Milwaukee, Milwaukee Area Technical College, Marquette University, the City of Milwaukee, Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District, and Milwaukee County, the 'M-6' was able to advocate together for new tools to support and build bold renewable energy projects.

2052,Economies of Scale - Reducing Overhead and Increasing Efficiency Across the Organization,"At colleges and universities everyone consumes energy, from the underground classrooms up to the president's office. But only a few of the staff are accountable for the incurred energy costs of a building. Continuous energy improvement (CEI) is a strategic program effectively integrating sustainability and energy efficiency into the organizational culture, changing behavior at all levels of the institution. It reinforces to everyone involved that controlling energy costs is important. After years of testing this model in Vermont, we have evidence that CEI helps to lower energy costs and ultimately, greenhouse gas emissions. The CEI model goes far beyond capital upgrades - which have traditionally been the major driver of energy efficiency initiatives. It applies innovative strategies to achieve operational improvements, update maintenance cycles, and to increase employee engagement in obtaining direct and indirect benefits from building-wide efficiency practices. This is a holistic, long-term, and data-driven approach to system-wide behavioral change. It helps businesses fully understand how they use, and how they can save, energy. CEI is designed in such a way that it generates a coherent 'roadmap' for effectively managing this critical component of costs to shifting market and energy landscapes. We will present the traditional CEI model and highlight the benefits for higher education institutions. We will then present an innovative new model of CEI that we have developed to increase energy efficiency behaviors at universities. This presentation will discuss the importance of peer support and learning and the value of a systematic approach to energy management. We'll also discuss ways to collaborate with business and municipalities to increase the success of CEI programs. CEI requires essential analytical skills, but its principles are not difficult to understand. It works when energy conservation becomes fully integrated into a university's culture.",University of Vermont,3995,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"continuous energy improvement (CEI),energy management,energy reduction",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Elizabeth Palchak,"Consultant, Social Scientist and Sustainable Funds Coordinator",University of Vermont,3995,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1869,Local Power: How to Partner With Local Investors to Install Renewable Energy Systems on Campus,"This session addresses the following question associated with the conference theme: 'How can higher education most effectively collaborate with business, government and civil society to create a sustainable economy?' The session will begin with three quick questions: 1. How many in attendance a) have installed renewable energy systems on campus or b) want to install such systems in the near future? 2. For those who do have systems, how many a) own the equipment, b) lease the equipment or c) host the equipment and purchase the energy under a long-term power purchase agreement? 3. For those who do have systems, how many are the result of partnerships with local investors? The bulk of the session will explain how Luther College has partnered with local investors to develop three significant solar energy projects on campus. The first involved Luther leasing 280 kW of solar photovoltaic (PV) equipment; the second involved Luther contracting to purchase all of the power from a 776 kW PV system installed in three places on campus; and the third will involve the installation of another 950 kW of PV paired with a 500 kW energy storage system. Attendees will learn: 1) How colleges can find potential investors in their communities. 2) How the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and accelerated depreciation (MACRS) on eligible equipment are attractive to investors. 3) How Luther used an 'open book' process to develop projects that offered a reasonable rate of return to the investor as well as short and long-term cost savings to the college. 4) Which parties on campus (Financial Services, Facilities, Legal) and off campus (Contractors, Accountants, Legal) played a role in developing the projects. 5) How Luther and the investor are planning for transferring the long-term ownership of the systems to the college.",Luther College,3098,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Investment & Finance,Public Engagement,,,,"renewable energy,power purchase agreements (PPAs)",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Jim Martin-Schramm,"Director, Center for Sustainable Communities",Luther College,3098,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_MartinSchramm_1179.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16037/1400_MartinSchramm_1179.pptx,,,,,,
1912,Tax Incentive use for Expanding Resilient Solar Power Infrastructure in Economically Depressed Areas,"Mr. Baker will lead a discussion of how solar power avoids wholesale energy costs, it also saves on non-energy costs related to distribution networks, generation capacity, and, in particular, transmission. How these trends translate into action plans for economically depressed areas utilizing tax credits and other incentives flowing from New Market Tax Credits or utilization of 5 years to permanent capital gains deferrals from investments made under the Opportunity Zone program and other tax credits used to advance resilient soar power in economically depressed areas. Examples will include one like how Hurricane Maria's path through Puerto Rico allowed insight into the durability of solar energy systems. A 645 kilowatt (kW) rooftop solar array on San Juan's VA Hospital installed in 2015 continued to operate 100% post-storm, even though it was exposed to 180 MPH hurricane winds. How using Low Income Housing Tax Credits in addition to building in 'Opportunity Zones' using Federal and State tax credits would allow the delivery of solar power with battery storage at 75% of existing power cost per kWh on the Island. Further data will be presented on commercial solar leases in context to a not-for-profit entity entering a 'Power Purchase Agreement' as a way of allowing a private sector investor who is able to take ownership of the solar array at first, utilize the Investment Tax Credit, and lease the system to the not-for-profit entity for 5 to 7 years at which point they buy the system at a substantially reduced price ( possibly as low as 15%-20% of the original price). The last discussion topic will be the opportunities that universities with active solar energy programs could pursue a private/public sector arrangement to allow investors to provide financing for not-for-profits who then step in as the manager of the infrastructure at the sites.

2020,Partnerships for Dramatic Energy Use Reduction On-Campus & Off,"In most urban areas, buildings contribute at least 75% of local greenhouse gas emissions, representing an opportunity to reduce energy use through benchmarking, conservation, and efficiency. As a result, a number of U.S. cities have adopted voluntary and mandatory benchmarking approaches related to energy usage. This presentation will focus on building energy use reduction efforts in Chicago and Pittsburgh - and how universities have enriched the conversation through off-campus partnerships with governments, businesses, and nonprofits. The Pittsburgh 2030 District is the largest of 22 such 2030 Districts in North America, actively pursuing 50% reductions in energy use, water consumption, and transportation emissions by the year 2030. Pittsburgh boasts 500+ buildings aspiring towards this measured high performance of, including over 100 owned by the University of Pittsburgh, which has embraced 2030 Challenge goals campus-wide, and regularly partners with some of the 100+ other property, community, and resource partners on a variety of projects. With the help of Loyola Chicago, the Archdiocese of Chicago is working to manage energy in over 2,500 buildings. Chicago is the first archdiocese in the U.S. to use EPA's Energy Star Portfolio Manager online benchmarking tool to benchmark its buildings' energy use, water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Loyola is supporting these efforts by providing student power to work with centralized utilities managers and parish engineers and business managers to make the case for increased energy awareness. This discussion will dive deep into regional partnerships working to enhance measured building performance both on-campuses and in our local communities.

2310,Affordable Renewable Energy for the Developing World that is Creating Jobs,"In our world, there are currently 1.3B people living with no access to electricity. The lack of electricity can have negative impacts on their education, communication, safety and even health. A clean source of electrical energy can dramatically improve living conditions by providing clean LED lighting at night, access to the vast knowledge base of the World Wide Web, and cellular communication. Due to the high cost of infrastructure, there is a trend away from centralized energy production towards distributed energy, producing energy right at or very close to the point of use. This move can increase reliability while reducing infrastructure costs. In the developed world, technology changes at an incredible pace. There are many opportunities to apply these now 'throwaway technologies' in the developing world. This provides countless possibilities to create solutions for global challenges through economic development. By combining solar photovoltaic, digital control circuitry, and lithium-ion battery storage, we have developed a safe and reliable source of clean energy that is affordable for a single-family unit and is available 24/7. The SLB50 is powered by the sun's energy, provides storage within lithium-ion cells, and has all the protection needed to prevent the catastrophic battery failures of the past. The energy bank has been sized to just meet the power needs of a single family. It will fully charge two smartphones and provide more than 5 hours of lighting to 100 square feet of living space. The energy bank is fully plug-n-plug, requiring no training or skills to operate. The design is complete and the cost to manufacture the unit is $20 U.S. Currently, we are identifying entrepreneurs in Haiti, Malawi and Sierra Leone to train them to produce the energy bank and solar module in their facilities, using their in-country labor. The entrepreneurs would then be responsible for distributing and servicing the product.",University of Central Florida,2006,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Public Engagement,,,,,"energy storage,economic development,developing world",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,David Norvell,Asst VP Sustainability Initiatives,University of Central Florida,2006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2041,Wood Bioenergy: Carbon Neutral or Worse Than Coal?,"As a growing number of institutions, cities, states, and nations work to achieve rapid decarbonization, many are turning to wood bioenergy. All forms of bioenergy are considered to be carbon neutral by governments around the world, including the US, the EU, and China. Most sustainability reporting systems, including AASHE-STARS, do not require institutions to report carbon emissions from wood bioenergy. These policies are predicated on the assumption that all carbon emitted from bioenergy is sequestered in forests that regrow after harvest. We present a dynamic model that allows users to interactively develop wood bioenergy scenarios and explore their carbon and climate impacts over time. The model enables users to vary the type of trees, harvest regimes, and post-harvest land use assumptions for wood bioenergy that displaces coal, natural gas, or a zero-carbon energy source such as solar or wind. We find that the carbon and climate impact of wood bioenergy is worse than coal for decades to centuries under a wide range of wood source, harvesting, and post-harvest assumptions. Increasing the use of wood bioenergy over time only worsens these impacts, as the pace at which 'carbon debt' is incurred through burning wood outstrips its 'repayment' through photosynthesis and carbon sequestration. Our work and others' raise questions about how AASHE and its member institutions should track wood bioenergy emissions, educate our students and other stakeholders about its impacts, and lead the way to a science-based transition to carbon neutrality.",University of Massachusetts Lowell,1729,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,,,,,,"bioenergy,biofuels,decarbonization",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Juliette Rooney-Varga,"Director, Associate Professor",University of Massachusetts Lowell,1729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2405,Paper and Plug Load Energy Reduction: How Focusing on two Issues Broadened our Reach,"In the current climate of fiscal restraint faced by many post-secondary institutions, it can be challenging for Sustainability Offices to advance their reach and impact with new programs and initiatives. In 2017, the Sustainability Office at Red River College found a way to grow our team by creating a position rooted in cost-savings. As a result, the Resource Reduction Specialist position was created to focus on two issues College-wide: paper and plug load energy reduction. Over the course of a two-year term, the Resource Reduction Specialist engaged staff, faculty and students in projects and initiatives to reduce paper and plug load energy consumption at the College while broadening the overall reach of the Sustainability Office. The creation of this focused position and the project's subsequent success can be attributed to four key factors: it was strategic, it was responsive, it was timely, and it capitalized on the existing strengths of the Sustainability Office. This presentation will explore these factors and how they were essential to securing the funding for this unique position and to building the key partnerships and relationships which helped the project succeed. The strategies and initiatives undertaken to engage the College community in paper and plug load energy reduction efforts will be discussed as well as the overall impacts of these efforts, including how the Sustainability Office's reach and impact were advanced among staff, faculty and students. Tips and lessons learned will be shared that can be applied not only to other paper and plug load energy reduction projects but to any effort to grow the capacity of sustainability initiatives.

1952,Strategic Planning of Energy Retrofits That Drive Cutting Edge Projects in GHG Reductions,"In 2014, Humber College (Toronto, Canada) faced a challenge familiar to many institutions. Despite years of incremental energy efficiency gains, large reductions in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions remained elusive, and government reduction targets of 30% by 2030, and 80% by 2050 were far out of reach. In 2015 Humber undertook a more strategic approach by developing a 20 year Integrated Energy Master Plan (IEMP) as a roadmap to reduce energy and water use by 50% / sqft and carbon by 30%, all while meeting financial payback targets and tying into academic programs. By leveraging short paybacks on projects like retro-commissioning we were able to include projects that do not normally get tackled like building envelope, which are critical to bringing down GHG emissions. The IEMP has been incredibly useful at providing both direction and quick approval for energy efficiency projects, but even more so by creating a culture of sustainability that has driven cutting edge projects that reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions. This presentation will describe the process of engaging senior level decision makers throughout the development of the IEMP, and showcase Humber's retrofit of Building NX using one of the highest-level building standards in the world - Passive House. Built in 1989 as a library, Building NX had a poor building envelope made of aluminum sandwich panels and glass block. Energy use was over 400 ekwh/m2/yr, making it one of the worst on campus, and there were constant complaints about leaks and temperature swings. Energy use data before and after the retrofit will be shared. The final project design has 14' thick exterior walls, Passive House certified windows and a new VRF mechanical system with an air source heat pump. The retrofitted building is projected to use only 64 ekwh/m2/yr and will be certified Net Zero Carbon. Through this project Humber has demonstrated one way to reduce carbon emissions by over 90% in an existing building.",Humber College,1979,,,,,,,,,,,Energy,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"emissions reduction,retrofits,planning,master plans",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Spencer Wood,"Director, Facilities Management",Humber College,1979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Wood_1653.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16263/0830_Wood_1653.pptx,,,,,,
2550,Working Towards Carbon Neutrality in Michigan Dining: Assessing the Impact of Sustainable Mondays,"In Fall 2018, the University of Michigan publicly pledged to a carbon-neutrality initiative. This pledge addressed carbon emissions from energy production and purchasing, but did not consider Scope 3 emissions, which include other ways the University contributes to climate change. Michigan Dining (MDining) hopes to harness the current momentum to address their emissions independent of the university-wide pledge. This research assessed the impact of MDining's Sustainable Mondays initiative, and is intended to be the first step of a broader project to create a roadmap to carbon-neutrality of MDining operations within ten years. Sustainable Mondays is a recent initiative for MDining; neither its efficacy nor reception have been assessed. During the 2018-2019 school year, MDining asked all nine dining halls to reduce or eliminate red meat from menus on Mondays, leaving implementation largely up to individual halls. Researchers worked with MDining Sustainability and Systems teams to collect estimated food purchasing data using order guides in the Foodservice Suite (FSS) system. This data was compiled for each week of the 18-19 school year, for each dining hall. For this analysis, only Monday and Wednesday data were used in order to compare Sustainable Mondays operations to a comparable typical weekday. To assign emissions values, the team labeled ~1700 unique food items by food product and food category. Using a recent meta-analysis (Heller et al., 2018) of food product Life Cycle Analyses, each food product was assigned an estimated greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) per kilogram. Once compiled, these estimates allowed the researchers to assess Sustainable Mondays' impact in each dining hall, compare among halls, and examine the food categories that played the largest role in emissions totals. These findings can be used to adjust Sustainable Mondays' implementation, and guide MDining's best path toward reducing emissions.",University of Michigan,1744,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,,,,Dining Services,,"carbon neutrality,vegan & plant-based foods,meat reduction,campus dining",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Krysten Dorfman,Graduate Student,University of Michigan,1744,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Dorfman_1926.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18462/1530_Dorfman_1926.pdf,,,,,,
2265,"Diverting Waste, Feeding Communities: The Cardinal Cupboard","Facing the highest rates of food insecurity amongst faculty, staff, and students of the University of Louisville and large amounts of food waste from on-campus dining facilities, student leaders opened the very first sustainable food pantry on UofL's campus: the Cardinal Cupboard. This pantry, student lead and operated, has served to address the social justice challenge of meeting the hunger needs on campus while combatting UofL's environmental impact. Through the Food Recovery Network national organization, students are trained to collect food at the end of the day from dining service locations on campus, transport the food to the Cardinal Cupboard, and make it available for students, staff, and faculty to access free resources when in need. Operating on a, 'take what you need, give what you can,' principle, the Cardinal Cupboard has created a unique culture of sustainability on the University of Louisville's campus as it serves as an approachable gateway for sustainable education in one of the most visited campus facilities. By having the ability to create sustainable education programming within and around the events associated with the pantry, student leaders have been able to both reduce the stigma of food insecurity on campus and promote sustainable lifestyle habits that are utilized within the pantry. From accessible education on recycling and compost to the reuse of materials, the pantry fosters a spirit of open-mindedness and sustainable economy not only through its internal practices but also its community impact. When food nears expiration within the pantry, it is delivered to charitable partner organizations within the Louisville community to enforce our support of and relationships with the greater area. The Cardinal Cupboard addresses a vast issue of our campus and community, so the body of research on food insecurity at UofL increases with the breadth of our work.

1976,Action in Campus Food: Developing a Framework to Measure Progress in Campus Foodscape Transformation,"This presentation will share the results of a systematic review of 23 institutions' campus food policies and projects using a dataset derived from the STARS food and dining reporting category. The review will be the basis of an action framework that can be used by institutions wishing to engage in campus foodscape projects and policies. This presentation seeks to address how STARS reporting is driving action in campus foodscapes and seeks to address the components of campus foodscape action which are not accounted for in the STARS questionnaire. Universities are considering how to transform their food environments across the world and the USA is at the forefront of this trend. However, until now there has been little attempt to make a systematic, interdisciplinary assessment of the types of policies and projects occurring in campus food environments. Action in campus foodscapes includes institutional moves to create more sustainable, healthier, more equitable and more inclusive food environments. This is being seen in the creation of policy and projects for change through programming, teaching, research and extra-curricular opportunities as well as action in procurement and infrastructure. This review and analysis seek to present a systems-focused view of work in campus food environments, considering governance, sustainability, public health, equity and inclusiveness, stakeholder relations as well as research and curriculum. This research is useful for institutions seeking to understand how to start work on their campus food environments. It will also consider this assessment in an international context and seek to address if the current STARS food and dining categories are relevant to international institutions with vastly different food and dining landscapes. This presentation is a component of a larger doctoral research project on action in campus foodscapes.",University of Melbourne,4556,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"food systems,policies,campus dining",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Sophie Lamond,Doctoral Student,University of Melbourne,4556,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Lamond_1764.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16332/1400_Lamond_1764.pptx,,,,,,

University of the Incarnate Word will discuss the development of their on Campus Pantry; Cardinal Cupboard and how their institution is addressing food insecurity personally. UIW will walk the audience through logistical, and physical transformations of the Cardinal Cupboard. Appalachian State University will give an overview of their Food Resource Hub and Free Store sharing their support system, and unique innovations. ASU will also share recurring issues and successful solutions that have helped their efforts become more efficient and impactful. Utah State University will be focusing their presentation on the collaboration of disconnected programs and creating a network of food insecurity fighters to maximize the sustainability of efforts.

2522,Student Food Security: Multi-Tiered Solutions to Reach all Food-Insecure Students,"Student food insecurity is a social justice issue that University and College Boards, Administrators, and Students are looking to solve. There are no silver bullet solutions, a comprehensive, multi-faceted solution that engages the entire campus community and reaches all food-insecure students is needed to truly end hunger on our campuses. Sodexo dining teams across more than 650 campus locations are working to deploy these solutions. This session will spotlight two Sodexo campuses we are partnering with to end student hunger, Northern Arizona University and University of Denver. Additionally, the leading nonprofit addressing hunger among college students, Swipe Out Hunger, will introduce their meal-share program that is active at University of Denver and many other Sodexo campuses. Northern Arizona University student food security strategy includes a meal plan scholarship that Sodexo supports, end-of-year student dining dollar donation to the campus pantry, Food Recovery Network donations, and a catering leftover program that is facilitated by a mobile-app notification system. University of Denver is working to address student food security with collaboration between departments and Student Outreach & Support. University of Denver students may receive food assistance through SNAP benefits, the campus food pantry and through the Swipe Out Hunger Meal Assistance program. Swipe Out Hunger will share University of Denver's Swipe Out Hunger model and how you can bring this program to your campus. Swipe Out Hunger and all the before mentioned programs, together, provide multiple touch-points and create a strong network to ensure we reach all our food insecure students and that they feel supported throughout their student journeys.

2071,"Lessons Learned from a Campus Food Pantry: Sustainability, Social Justice, and Campus Partnerships","Hunger and food insecurity are growing problems on college campuses. The rising cost of a college education and the increasing number of nontraditional students mean that more students are struggling to navigate the costs of paying for college, housing, food, and other living expenses while on tight budgets. Food insecurity, the lack of reliable access to sufficient quantities of affordable, nutritious food is common at higher education institutions throughout the country. Feeding America (2017) found that 30.5% of students reported having to choose between food and educational expenses. Seeing a rise in food insecurity among students, the University of Denver began a campus Food Pantry housed in the Center for Sustainability. Campus food insecurity programs are typically run out of Student Life Departments rather than Sustainability Centers. This unique program allows the university to link hunger alleviation to campus gardens, food waste initiatives, and sustainable food policies, facilitating a unique multi-pronged approach. The case study detailed here provides specifics on how linking student support and campus sustainability efforts can result in social sustainability impacts and leverage resources in new ways to better support students. Other campuses should consider how food insecurity initiatives that live in offices of student life can partner with Sustainability Centers to address other food-related causes. This case study describes an innovative program at the University of Denver that works to address food insecurity by linking the provision of a campus Food Pantry with sustainable food and the incorporation of social sustainability into a systematic mission. Housing the campus Food Pantry program with the Center for Sustainability allows for multiple intersecting approaches to address food insecurity.",University of Denver,2186,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,"food banks & pantries,food security,social justice",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Elizabeth Kepl,Food Pantry Team Lead,University of Denver,2186,Emily Schosid,Sustainability Program Coordinator,University of Denver,2186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Kepl_1476.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16702/0830_Kepl_1476.pptx,0830_Kepl_1476.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16702/0830_Kepl_1476.pdf,,,,
2130,Creating a Student-Led Campaign for a Self-Operated Dining System: How to get Started at Your School,"At Western Washington University, students have been leading a multi-year effort to implement a self-operated dining system after the decade long contract with Aramark expires in 2021. Currently, WWU is one of the roughly 70% of universities nationwide contracted by one of the 'big three' dining corporations: Aramark, Sodexo or Compass Group. Collectively, these three corporations operate across the globe providing food for universities, hospitals, and prisons. Alternatively, a self-operated dining system would be run entirely by the university, rather than with a third party corporation - such as one of the 'big three' - in which university administration outsources dining responsibility. Being self-operated would grant students more transparency in the food sourcing process and allow for more student input into what kind of food is being served. Self-operated dining would also mean breaking from the prisons and jails that the 'big three' profit off of. These monopolistic corporations exploit the disproportionally black and brown prison populations by serving cheap and unhealthy food, thereby supporting an already violent institution. Additionally, each of these corporations uses the kickback system - corporate bribery which acts as a significant barrier for small food providers who may otherwise try to compete for dining contracting bids - and each have bad track records of labor exploitation and mismanagement. Becoming self-operated is the next step towards becoming a school that champions food justice and student voices, but we know that this effort is more easily attainable with a large network of universities collectively fighting for that change. Join us during our session to learn more about the process we've taken to get here, how we've structured our organization, and what it would look like to begin a similar campaign on your own campus. This will also be a time to analyze the specific hurdles unique to your school and get connected to others.",Western Washington University,1876,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,,Dining Services,,"social justice,equity,students,campus dining",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Michael Prostka,Undergraduate Student,Western Washington University,1876,Emmaline Bigongiari,Sustainability Staff,Western Washington University,1876,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2302,Food Systems Down Under: Lessons from the Australian Context and The Fair Food Challenge,"This presentation will look at action in campus food systems in Australian universities. Australia has been slow to adopt action in campus foodscape transformation and there have been recent advancements in engagement in this area. This presentation will provide an overview of policies and projects at Australian universities and networks in the Australian sustainability higher education sector. It will also draw heavily on the presenter's own experiences starting and developing an organisation to advocate for food system projects on campus. The organisation Fair Food Challenge was started in 2015 as a student run initiative at the University of Melbourne with an aim to transform the campus food environment to a more healthy, fair, equitable and sustainable system. The Challenge runs a series of projects such as community kitchens, a serving ware re-use service, a portable bike kitchen, community lunches, food waste workshops, a community food store and free fruit boxes in the library. As well the team conducts research, facilitates community feedback and empowers students to participate in university policy decisions that shape the future of the institution. This presentation will share some of the successes and barriers that this project has had in working to transform the campus food environment to be more sustainable, inclusive and healthier. It will also consider the institutional context of The University of Melbourne and the roll of out of its Sustainability Plan. It will then discuss how this project has developed in response to similar projects in international contexts and ask how we can strengthen international communities of practice for knowledge sharing in this arena.",University of Melbourne,4556,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,"Australia,international,food systems",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Sophie Lamond,Doctoral Student,University of Melbourne,4556,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Lamond_1779.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17330/1530_Lamond_1779.pdf,,,,,,
1995,Leveraging the Power of Institutional Purchasing to Create a Sustainable Economy through Fair Trade,"Fair Trade Campaigns is a powerful grassroots movement mobilizing thousands of conscious consumers and Fair Trade advocates on campuses and in communities across the U.S. Our Fair Trade Colleges & Universities program partners with over one hundred campuses via food service, sustainability and procurement commitments to co-create a sustainable economy, as well as with students to be active participants in the sustainable economy through their consumption choices and advocacy efforts on campus. Fair Trade helps co-create a sustainable economy not only here in the U.S., but for farmers and workers across the globe that produce the products we consume daily, by enabling sustainable livelihoods through community development funds and a minimum price guarantee, two core staples of Fair Trade. In this session, we will provide an overview of the three main pillars of Fair Trade, social, economic and environmental standards and uncover how campuses can help co-create a sustainable economy for producers abroad by completing the steps to earn designation as a Fair Trade College/University. In addition to gaining a basic understanding of Fair Trade and the Fair Trade College/University designation process, attendees will hear first-hand how two designated Fair Trade Universities, Arizona State University and the University of California at Irvine, are leveraging their institutional purchasing power and partnering with campus stakeholders to co-create a sustainable economy by sourcing and promoting Fair Trade. In addition, representatives from both campuses will share how earning the Fair Trade Campus designation has enabled them to meet their campus food service provider's socially responsible purchasing goals and achieve additional credits under STARS 2.1 Exemplary Practices, a new type of credit within the Innovation & Leadership category of STARS.",Fair Trade Colleges & Universities,0787,Aramark Higher Education,3691,Arizona State University,4531,"University of California, Irvine",4502,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Purchasing,,Dining Services,,"fair trade,third party certifications",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Kylie Nealis,Campus and Community Engagement Manager,Fair Trade Colleges & Universities,0787,Krista O'Brien,Sustainability Manager,Aramark Higher Education,3691,Nick Cookson,Program Manager,Arizona State University,4531,Enola Fulgencio,"Sustainability Coordinator, UCI Dining","University of California, Irvine",4502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Nealis_1364.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16408/1100_Nealis_1364.pptx,,,,,,
2137,Fair Trade Campus Advocacy for a Sustainable Economy,"Fair Trade Campaigns is a powerful grassroots movement mobilizing thousands of conscious consumers and Fair Trade advocates on campuses and in communities across the U.S. Our Fair Trade Colleges & Universities program partners with more than one hundred college campuses via food service, sustainability and procurement commitments to co-create a sustainable economy, as well as with students to be active participants in the sustainable economy through their individual consumption choices and advocacy efforts on campus. Fair Trade helps co-create a sustainable economy not only here in the U.S., but for farmers and workers across the globe that produce the products we consume daily, by enabling sustainable livelihoods through community development funds and a minimum price guarantee, two of the core staples of Fair Trade. In this session, we will provide a brief overview of the three main pillars of Fair Trade, social, economic and environmental standards. We'll also engage in an interactive discussion around how students can help co-create a sustainable economy for producers abroad by advocating for Fair Trade and leveraging their institution's purchasing power in favor of socially responsible and sustainable purchasing. We'll also cover best practices for campus advocacy, and the valuable role that strategic partnerships play in successful efforts, while asking attendees to share insights from their own campus advocacy efforts. Joining the session will be representatives of Gonzaga's Fair Trade University campaign, who will share how their campaign has approached the process of earning the Fair Trade University designation, and the successes and challenges they've faced along the way.

1991,The Future of Real Food,"The past ten years have seen a dramatic shift in real food purchasing on college and university campuses. Local food and sustainability are now common conversations in campus dining. Values around fair labor and animal welfare are increasingly present, with new initiatives and resources supporting those changes. There is more transparency in food on campus, with the student-led Real Food Calculator tool and other systems for tracking purchasing, setting clear goals, and educating the campus about our food system. More than 80 institutions have made formal commitments to real food (local & community based, fair, humane, and ecologically sound), and countless others track their purchasing towards similar goals. At the same time, only some campuses have seen these changes, and only some farmers, ranchers and fishermen have been able to reap the benefits of selling to institutional markets. Campuses with deep research ties to large food and agribusiness companies or those with fewer financial resources have faced significant barriers. Black farmers, community-based fishermen, local minority-owned businesses, and others who are critical to an equitable, sustainable, and resilient food system continue to be shut out of the market. Join us for an interactive workshop to discuss learnings from 10+ years of organizing for real food in higher ed and to explore a new campaign to fundamentally re-orient the foodservice industry towards real food. Together, we will explore how higher ed can continue to catalyze the transition to a more just and sustainable food economy.",Real Food Challenge,6891,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Public Engagement,Purchasing,,,,"real food,racial & ethnic diversity,social justice,food purchasing,food systems",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Tina White,Program Coordinator,Real Food Challenge,6891,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_White_1329.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18124/0915_White_1329.pdf,,,,,,

Also tied closely with EAT-Lancet Commission recommendations on Food, Planet, and Health and the Sustainable Development Goals, Harvard's Sustainable & Healthful Food Standards (April 2019) align our major food partners around a broad definition of success. This framework includes focuses on (1) climate and ecosystems, (2) consumer well-being, including nutrition, (3) education and food literacy, (4) reduction of wasted food, (5) animal welfare, and (6) worker and community well-being throughout the value chain. Harvard students, faculty, and staff have been using the campus as a living lab to test new strategies for driving demand for sustainable healthful food through the dining halls, retail locations, and catering. OFS worked with faculty and students to create a Sustainable Meeting and Event Guide and a Plant-based Eating Guide. By addressing both demand and supply sides, all internal and external stakeholders have a role to play in creating a better food system.",Harvard University,4451,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Research,,Sustainability Office,,"food systems,applied research,living labs",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,David Havelick,Sustainability Staff,Harvard University,4451,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Havelick_1485.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18285/1100_Havelick_1485.pptx,,,,,,

We are nearing upon the 2020 deadline of 20% Real food. We would like to share our progress and lessons we have learned throughout this journey. The most exciting recent purchasing shifts have come from our implementation of the Vote Real campaign and integration of humane meat on campus. Our partnership with Sodexo, our on-campus food service, and the local farm co-op LINC has allowed us to steadily grow our percentage of Real food. We have plans for the Spring Semester to involve the larger student body in celebrating Vote Real and humane meat purchases by building on existing events and capitalizing on Earth Week. As the Real Food Challenge comes to a close in 2020, we are working to ensure lasting change through a school food policy and fostering a culture that prioritizes healthier, more sustainable food.",Gonzaga University,2258,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,,,Dining Services,,real food,10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Annie Wissmiller,Real Food Club,Gonzaga University,2258,Emma Hayden,Student,Gonzaga University,2258,Ellen Bradley,Student (Senior),Gonzaga University,2258,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2050,Training Future Food System Leaders Using Campus Food Economies,"This session is guided by two principle questions: 1. What are all the aspects of a campus food economy and how are students engaged? 2. What structures are in place for students to participate in their campus's food economy? The two main objectives of campus farms and gardens are to grow local food and to develop future food systems leaders. Institutions of higher education have the privilege of focusing on the latter. However, to be authentic living-learning laboratories, campus farms and gardens must also contribute authentically to the campus food economy. This panel will focus on the necessity of a balance between these two objectives. Programs built around growing food and supplying it to campus eaters provide students not only with applicable life skills but also the opportunity to co-create their campus's food economy. The presenters manage operations of various scales, located on distinct campuses. Each program focuses on unique goals while facing different challenges growing produce and building interdisciplinary programming. Each program has aspects only seen at their campus. For example, one campus uses a greenhouse facility on top of a residence hall, the only one of its kind in the nation. The presenters will share case studies from their respective universities on the importance of student co-created food economies using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as an organizational framework.",University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,University of Utah,3994,Loyola University Chicago,1865,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,,,,,"campus grown foods,leadership,students",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Thomas Bryan,Program Coordinator and Greenhouse Manager,University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,Jessica Kemper,Sustainable Food Initiatives Manager,University of Utah,3994,Kevin Erickson,Sustainable Agriculture Manager,Loyola University Chicago,1865,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Bryan_1748.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16631/0915_Bryan_1748.pdf,,,,,,
2134,We Have POWER: Building a Movement for Food Justice on Campus,"Our food system is in crisis. From the fields to the factories, people who work in the food chain face low wages, sexual harassment, and dangerous working conditions. Food insecurity is on the rise on college campuses. Black farmers have lost 14 million acres of land since the 1920s, and now make up only 2% of farmers in the U.S. Fishermen and farmers are fighting for fair prices as big food corporations gain increasing control of the market. And across the world, rural economies are threatened as these same companies push people off of their land, exploit labor, and market unhealthy foods to communities. These big food companies are the same ones we see in our dining halls and our stadiums, in our research labs and our classrooms. Colleges and universities have the potential to be powerful anchors for a sustainable and equitable food economy. But all too often, they put the interests of Big Food corporations first, over the students and community members they are meant to serve. All too often, they are part of the system upholding racism and white supremacy, instead of one that is truly equitable to all. We know that another way is possible -- for our communities to have real control in the food system, and for institutions of higher ed to support the vision of a food system that nourishes all of us. Join us to learn about a new campaign and movement strategy to challenge Big Food corporations and white supremacy in the food system, and to bring real food to campuses across the country! In this workshop, we will explore the leverage that we have as students to build a more just and sustainable food system.

2484,Big Red Eats Green: Empowering Students to Engage in their University Food System,"This presentation will share the details of an established, multi-year endeavor that focuses on the relationship between students and the university food system. An event that celebrates and showcases that IU is attempting to make a dent in the local economy encourages students to take a more active role in university food purchasing. This presentation will go over a successful model of engaging students in the sustainability work of institutional dining that could be applied to other universities around the nation. The food system on many college campuses, including Indiana University, is not transparent in the purchasing of food, the vendors supplying the food, and the effect a university has on its food system, environment, and regional economy. An annual event, Big Red Eats Green (BREG), hosted by Sustain IU and IU Dining on Indiana University's campus seeks to make visible those invisible elements going on behind the scenes that students do not often get to see. BREG bridges the gap between the food the students see in dining halls and the vendors, growers and farmers that supply that food. The goal of the event is to create an inclusive environment that allows for conversations to occur between Real Food Challenge vendors and students, exploring issues such as: sustainability, workers' rights, local economies, and the humane treatment of animals. Each vendor represents an aspect of the Real Food Challenge- a national organization that sets sustainable food procurement guidelines for universities to follow. By engaging students with vendors, students feel more empowered to make changes in their own food system and increase awareness of the effect that student influence can have in university purchasing.",Indiana University Bloomington,6354,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,,,Dining Services,Sustainability Office,"real food,student engagement,food systems,campus dining",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Emma Schuster,Student,Indiana University Bloomington,6354,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2112,Implementing Experiential Education to Change Food Culture in Non-Land Grant Universities,"This presentation will cover lessons learned in creating and adapting an experiential sustainable agriculture program as it applies to a non-land grant university, without a dedicated agriculture program. Indiana University has a unique campus farm model: the farm is located adjacent to campus in collaboration with a local historic restoration nonprofit. The University has no agriculture or horticulture program, thus success of the IU Campus Farm has been garnered by diverse and creative partnerships with faculty in public health, conservation, and recreational sports, as well as philanthropy, administrator buy-in and student engagement. The last 18 months have seen the start of a campus farm and the expansion of an individual garden plot program, both with the focus of increasing awareness and hands-on opportunity in the production of sustainable food for students, staff and faculty. We will present the staff and volunteer structure of the Farm, Farm Advisory Board model, including results of farm visitation, diversity of engaged student backgrounds and the changing of some University food purchasing policies. In addition to success in these fields, we will give insights into some key challenges, both institutionally and programmatically, with implementation. Throughout, the presentation will utilize both published literature (notably from Leslie Duram) on the benefits of this style of program, as well as the findings of our own iteration. Lastly, this presentation will look to apply this work to other universities by challenging audience members throughout to consider the direct and indirect effects of sustainable food engagement: local food procurement and affecting food culture, to consider where a hands-on educational component could be implemented.",Indiana University Bloomington,6354,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,,,,,"experiential learning,sustainable agriculture,farms,community engagement",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Adam Diersing,Undergraduate Student,Indiana University Bloomington,6354,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2195,"The Pursuit of Delicious, Carbon-Friendly Food","This year, with customer health and the environment in mind, Cal Dining defined their vision statement as 'serving delicious food that happens to be nutritious and sustainable', understanding that serving menus that prioritize plants at the center of the plate is necessary to achieve carbon neutrality goals. According to research conducting by the World Resources Institute, limiting meat consumption would reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly enough to help our planet feed 10 billion people by the year 2050. After our plant-forward cafe, browns became the most popular dining location on campus, we started to explore opportunities to improve plant-forward options in our all- you -care-to-eat dining halls. There, we are consistently asked to serve more vegetarian and vegan options, however, we still see a limited number of customers eating our plant-based options. We recognized that our traditionally- trained chefs are skilled at adding value to animal products but have less experience with plant-based dishes. With the goal of serving delicious, carbon-friendly dishes, the Housing & Dining Sustainability Team partnered with chefs throughout Cal Dining to host the 'Plant-forward Recipe Challenge'. Each week a chef was challenged to create a unique dish with a locally grown vegetable and plant-based protein. If the dish did contain animal products, the vegan option needed to be equally delicious. Sustainability Team members collected student reactions from the dishes to ensure the dishes were first and foremost, delicious. This project not only engaged students in eating more carbon-friendly meals, but the dining staff is also fully engaged in getting the best scores from the student surveys. By the end of just one semester, we will have collected 14 new student-approved plant-forward recipes for next year's dining hall menu!","University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,,,Dining Services,,"vegan & plant-based foods,meat reduction,vegetarian foods,campus dining,student engagement,outreach campaigns",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Samantha Lubow,Sustainability Coordinator,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Lubow_1586.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17038/0830_Lubow_1586.pptx,,,,,,

2115,Combating Food Insecurity Through Sustainable Student-Led Initiatives,"This case study will include information on the efforts of staff, faculty, and students to eliminate food insecurity among students on Baldwin Wallace's campus. The project began about three years ago and has continued to grow and expand since that time. University President Robert Helmer signed the Presidents United to Solve Hunger (PUSH) Initiative in 2017 and spurred a greater discussion about hunger on campus. Our goal at BW is to reduce food insecurity through multiple channels and help students flourish. In 2018, Dr. Jill Fleiser conducted a study of BW students and found that food insecurity is a major problem on our campus and has caused students to miss class, skip meals, feel ill, and suffer decreased engagement. These findings urged BW to address the challenges of food insecurity in an efficient and sustainable manner. Campus Kitchens, a student-led hunger relief organization that focuses on food recovery, has motivated students to become involved and provide meals to those in need. By involving the students in the discussion, we created a space for students needs to be heard. Campus Kitchens partnered with faculty and the administration to create a Sustainable Food Taskforce to tackle the growing problem of food insecurity and food waste on our campus. This task force has led a multi-pronged effort to help students who are food insecure. Part of their work has been to develop an app that will help connect hungry students with free food on campus that would otherwise go to waste. BW students are contributing to this innovative effort through software design and participation in the planning process. When this app launches, it will encourage more students to come to events, prevent food waste, and decrease food insecurity. To do this, the Sustainable Food Taskforce has placed donated refrigerators around campus so any recovered food can be moved by a team of students, and be kept at a safe temperature until it can be picked up by hungry students.",Baldwin Wallace University,3384,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,Wellbeing & Work,,,,"food security,food recovery,food waste,student engagement",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Sarah Myer,Undergraduate Student,Baldwin Wallace University,3384,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1960,Meatless to Mindful Monday: The Progression of Promoting Less and Better Meat at UNC Asheville,"In this presentation, we will review the evolution of one school's efforts to promote less and better meat eating on campus. In 2015, UNC Asheville Dining Services began hosting monthly 'Meatless Mondays' as part of our commitment to raise awareness of the environmental implications of meat consumption. Unfortunately, this initiative did more harm than good with certain clientele leaving bad remarks on our social media page. Next, we shifted to 'Less Meat Monday,' where we feature multiple plant-based entrees and a select higher welfare meat dish. After several months we noticed a decline in business on those days and an increase of participation at other locations that serve proportionally more meat. It became clear that the intention was not creating the desired outcome. Here began the switch to 'Mindful Mondays.' We found shifting the term from 'less' to 'mindful' gave a better feeling to the diners, and subsequently attendance improved. Using peer to peer education, students passionate about meat consumption and its inter-sectional effects on the built environment and surrounding ecosystem, team up with Dining Services to share messages about resource use, flipping the plate, protein comparison and much more. All tables are interactive, engaging and drive home the message that you don't need to give up meat entirely to make a difference. It was understanding and adapting to our community needs that made this initiative successful. Through incremental steps and with the help of students, including 5 who identify as vegans, Dining Services at UNC Asheville also successfully launched a local and humanely-sourced beef burger blended with 33% local mushrooms. This presentation will share steps it took to create, launch and ultimately offer this burger on the menu full time.","University of North Carolina, Asheville",4237,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Campus Engagement,,,,,"meat reduction,outreach campaigns",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Meghan Ibach,Sustainability and Marketing Manager for Dining Services,"University of North Carolina, Asheville",4237,Danielle Holtz,Student; Chartwells Sustainability & Marketing Intern,"University of North Carolina, Asheville",4237,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Ibach_1683.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16288/1400_Ibach_1683.pdf,,,,,,
2038,Supporting a Sustainable Economy Through Partnership With Local Food Hubs,"This session will showcase how to effectively collaborate with local producers to build a more sustainable economy through increased purchases of local products and to raise awareness about food systems on campus. Supplier partnerships with organizations like the Local Inland Northwest Cooperative and the Puget Sound Food Hub have proven to be a mutually beneficial model for connecting campus communities to small, local producers in the Pacific Northwest. It supports growth of the regional food system and expands offerings of local, in-season products to campuses. As organizations closely connected to local producers, co-ops and food hubs are conduits to small producers that may not otherwise have access to larger buyers. Co-ops communicate buyer needs to farmer members which may vary from the needs of individuals or smaller restaurants. Seasonal crop planning with farmers allows chefs to align menus with locally available products to maximize support of the farmers. This close relationship fosters community-based agriculture and healthier lifestyle choices on campus and allows producers to grow their business over time. It has resulted in greater procurement of local products as measured by AASHE STARS or the Real Food Challenge, which is a priority for many campuses. Furthermore, these partnerships provide students the opportunity to connect directly with their food- a transparent model that teaches sustainable food system knowledge and imparts lifelong awareness. Locally sourced meals provide students with a sense of place and seasonality, while visits by local producers connect the campus community to the broader local community. Finally, as we expand plant-based menus to meet growing demand and reduce our impact, local produce figures prominently. Not only does the natural seasonality of product create variety in the menu, but it also provides fresh, wholesome and delicious meals.",Sodexo USA,3600,LINC Foods,9508,Puget Sound Food Hub,9506,Gonzaga University,2258,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,Public Engagement,,Dining Services,,"local foods,local purchasing,community partnerships,food purchasing",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Lara Seng,Regional Sustainability Manager,Sodexo USA,3600,Chris Studtmann,Senior Area Executive Chef,Sodexo USA,3600,Dan Jackson,Director of Sales and Marketing,LINC Foods,9508,Mark Whims,Sales Manager,Puget Sound Food Hub,9506,Annie Wissmiller,Real Food Club,Gonzaga University,2258,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2007,Going Beyond Local to Build Just and Sustainable Rural Economies,"Historically, the phrase 'sustainable food' focused exclusively on environmental impacts of food production, but to build a truly sustainable food system we must broaden the aperture to consider how the food system supports (or doesn't) the farmers responsible for producing our food. The dominant industrial food system leaves independent farmers, who often prioritize environmentally sustainable and humane practices, to compete with massive agriculture companies that have manipulated markets to benefit them. Today, farmers make just 14.8 cents of every dollar that consumers spend on food, and in the last 40 years, the U.S. has lost 95 percent of its egg farmers, 90 percent of its pig producers, and 88 percent of dairy producers. Institutions of higher education have a key role to play in helping to build an equitable food system that prioritizes fair economic practices that support successful independent farmers. By shifting dining options from large agriculture companies that prioritize profits over people to independent farmers, colleges and universities have the power to build a truly sustainable food economy; one that preserves our lands and water, protects animal welfare, and supports rural communities for generations to come. This panel will feature a leading academic whose research focuses on sustainable agriculture and rural economies; a student activist who is working to add fair food to their dining services; a representative from a sustainable meat company committed to fair partnerships with their farmers; a university sustainability manager; and an advocacy leader who has successfully worked with institutions to shift to higher-welfare meat. In addition to providing historical context about industrial agriculture, this panel will focus on how colleges and universities have successfully made the transition to more humanely raised meat in the face of tight budgets, restrictions from food service contracts and other hurdles.",Niman Ranch,9036,Farm Forward,7604,University of Missouri,3593,Aramark Higher Education,3691,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,,,"food systems,farms,economic development",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Ron Mardesen,Farmer/Field Agent,Niman Ranch,9036,Andrew deCoriolis,Executive Director,Farm Forward,7604,John Ikerd,Professor Emeritus,University of Missouri,3593,Carolyn Gahn,Sustainability Manager,Aramark Higher Education,3691,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Ikerd_1428.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16457/1100_Ikerd_1428.pdf,,,,,,
1990,"Local, Sustainable, Grassfed and Delicious: Harvest Table North Carolina Case Study","More than two decades of work to promote local, sustainable and real food in colleges has transformed what it means to succeed in foodservice. It's raised awareness of the carbon footprint of meat and also how colleges can contribute to local food economies. But one thing has remained unchanged: burgers still are the most popular sandwich on campus. Getting local and sustainable values between the buns is one of the biggest opportunities in foodservice and one of the most important places to start to make foodservice more sustainable. That's the challenge we took on in North Carolina, where Harvest Table Culinary Group is making a dramatic change in what it means to cook, serve and eat a burger. Harvest Table switched ALL of the beef used in every burger and other dishes to local grass-fed beef while also blending it with chopped mushrooms, removing conventional commodity beef from all dining operations at Wake Forest University and other campuses. In doing so, we used a proven culinary strategy to achieve a big local and sustainable food change. The 'blend' has been used before with conventional meat and lowered the carbon footprint of a burger, with mushrooms also adding umami (instead of salt), texture and moisture to make a tastier and healthier burger. Grass-fed meat has been used in college dining, but only occasionally and alongside conventional beef because of cost. Also, grass-fed beef is healthier but has less fat, so some foodservice operations blended in more beef fat. Our approach brought the two together for some remarkable and delicious outcomes. Our presentation will show 1) How we made the switch to local grass-fed beef affordably! 2) The recipes and culinary techniques used to get there. 3) All the performance indicators we used to measure environmental, nutrition, and local economic benefits as well as foodservice operational metrics and student diner satisfaction which can be used to build the case for changing foodservice at other colleges.",Changing Tastes,8296,Wake Forest University,0475,Harvest Table Culinary Group,9509,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,Dining Services,,"meat reduction,campus dining",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Arlin Wasserman,Partner,Changing Tastes,8296,Dedee DeLongpre Johnston,Chief Sustainability Officer,Wake Forest University,0475,Matthew Thompson,Chief Culinary Officer,Harvest Table Culinary Group,9509,Tim Vandermeersch,Wake Forest Harvest Table,Wake Forest University,0475,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Wasserman_1328.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16387/1445_Wasserman_1328.pptx,,,,,,
2510,Sustaining Local Producers Through University Purchasing,"Universities have the opportunity to play a pivotal role in their local economies by buying local. Through their large purchasing power in food procurement, universities can support a local food system specifically. There are many benefits to buying local such as job creation, minimizing environmental impact, and closer producer-purchaser relationships. There are however several challenges to this exchange. Universities tend to have a large and seasonal demand, and small businesses can struggle to meet requirements for institutional purchasing. How can institutions and local producers overcome their barriers to successful partnership? In our workshop, we will walk through case studies of partnerships between Johns Hopkins University and several local food producers. We will share interviews between dining procurement coordinators and local vendors as well as Bon Appetit staff and other institutional purchasers. A mix of growing pains and miscommunications along with successful opportunities for expansion can be seen in these stories. Through the research shared, we will examine why and how some of these partnerships have failed while others have flourished. Together we'll brainstorm some of the best practices necessary to support both producers and universities in buying local.",Johns Hopkins University,0515,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,Dining Services,,"local foods,local purchasing,food purchasing",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Katherine Smith,Student,Johns Hopkins University,0515,Riya Gupta,Undergraduate Student,Johns Hopkins University,0515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Gupta_1303.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18280/1445_Gupta_1303.pptx,,,,,,
2548,Turning Values Into Results: The Real Food Calculator and Real Food Procurement,"Through their purchasing power, institutions of higher education are in a position to create positive change in our food system that is currently dominated by industrial agriculture and exploitative, unsustainable practices. The Real Food Calculator allows colleges and universities to audit their campus food system to quantify the impact they have through their food purchasing. How can we effectively use the Real Food Calculator in our institutions? How do we use that research to further the goals and values we strive for in food procurement? Students, sustainability staff, campus dining administrators, and faculty will learn how to set up Calculator research and interpret its results. We will also identify our real food values (Local/Community Based, Fair, Ecologically Sound, and Humane) and explore with other institutions creative ways and best practices to pivot their food purchasing towards these shared values. Attendees will take away tangible tools to measure their real food impact, a network of peer institutions to be supported by, and a renewed sense of energy to guide their institutions towards a just and sustainable food system for all. This networking session is intended for institutions that want to learn more about the Real Food Calculator and gather insights from peer institutions on how they've utilized this tool. It is also intended for institutions in the Real Food Challenge network that would like to share their experience and learnings while being in discussion with other institutions in the network.",Real Food Challenge,6891,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Purchasing,,,,,"real food,food purchasing",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Tina White,Program Coordinator,Real Food Challenge,6891,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1645_White_1889.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18454/1645_White_1889.pdf,,,,,,
1874,Menus of Change University Research Collaborative: Collaboration to Change the Food System,"The MCURC is a working group of scholars and campus dining leaders from invited colleges and universities interested in accelerating efforts to move American consumers-and college/university students, scholars, and staff in particular-toward menus that integrate both health and sustainability imperatives. MCURC leverages the unique position of universities to advance healthier, more sustainable life-long food choices among students by connecting a diversity of insights from faculty, dining services, students, and researchers. The collaboration recognizes that a significant amount of energy for food systems transformation today is being driven by concerned university students and forward-looking faculty and administration, and understands that university food systems hold considerable untapped potential to further catalyze existing efforts. This presentation will share research findings and best practices from the 60+ universities in the collaborative in making campus dining more sustainable through research, education, and a collective greenhouse gas reduction initiative. This presentation will focus on the following MCURC sustainability programs: -research on students' food choices and food waste, a national study on food waste at universities, research on whether a class on food and climate can change students' eating behaviors, and a peer-reviewed study on food labeling and plant-forward food choices, -a collective impact initiative focused on reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from food purchases from almost 30 universities, -a food waste study that understands the metrics and sources of food waste from multiple universities, -sustainable food education and outreach best practices from over 30 universities, -MCURC student fellows' best practices to engage students in sustainable food behaviors, and -sustainable menu recipes created by the MCURC Chefs' Committee focused on implementing the 24 principles set forth by the Menus of Change.",Boston College,2230,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Research,Public Engagement,,,,"food systems,inter-campus collaboration",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Julianne Stelmaszyk,"Manager, Regional & Sustainable Food Systems",Boston College,2230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Stelmaszyk_1195.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18308/0830_Stelmaszyk_1195.pdf,,,,,,
1871,Closing the Loop on Food Waste: Leftovers From Catered Events Feed Hungry Students,"Food waste at catered events is an issue we see so often as most event planners tend to over order, while at the same time we see a growth in the number of college students facing food insecurity. At Northern Arizona University, we have implemented a program, Louie's Leftovers, to combat food waste at catered events that can also address the issue of food insecurity. Louie's Leftovers was created through an interdepartmental food insecurity task force which included members from our student government (ASNAU), dining services, first-generation office, faculty senate, and ITS. This program is open to all students, faculty, and staff who sign up to receive alerts through our university's app. During our session, we will explain the need for the program, details on the protocol on the catering end, how students can sign up for alerts, how event hosts can send an alert, hurdles and successes, and details on working with ITS to set up this alert system.",Northern Arizona University,0567,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Waste,Wellbeing & Work,,Dining Services,,"food waste,food security,catering",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Gabriela Galvan,"Sustainability Coordinator, Campus Dining",Northern Arizona University,0567,Casey Fisher,Director of Marketing and Strategic Planning,Northern Arizona University,0567,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Galvan_1186.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16043/1445_Galvan_1186.pptx,,,,,,
2117,"Food Insecurity, Recovery, and Redistribution: Sustainable Food Practices for Institutions","Bemidji State University finds itself in a paradoxical struggle: many of our students struggle with food insecurity, but we are so overwhelmed by an excess of food that much of it must be thrown away at the end of the day. The problem is making a connection between these two parties. Working closely with our on-campus food service provider Aramark the Sustainability Office has taken food labeled as excess, expired, or undesirable and brought it to hungry students. The Food Recovery Network is an on-campus and community effort. The food we recover or receive goes to the campus ministry church, the Women's Shelter, the community food shelf, and when possible (due to timing) it's brought to student events. Food that would otherwise go to a landfill outside of Bemidji is now serving as breakfast, lunch, and dinner for many students and community members. Currently, the Sustainability Office recovers and redistributes food every single day. Bagels, pastries, and bread slices are regular, in addition to whatever has been served and leftover from the food court that day. Food recovery can prove challenging. The donations are uncertain, for example, the number of leftover bagels can't be determined until the coffee shop is closed. When the last chance to sell the food has passed, our food recovery volunteers have to be on-call to collect the food and find it a home. BSU's Sustainability Office has a unique community contact form outlining which businesses are able to take what amount and type of food, when they are available, and who to call. It also includes office staff with vehicles able to help pick-up in the case of a large donation. A secondary problem with food recovery is maintaining food safety standards. The Sustainability Office must always be operating within the 'critical period' or time between when food has been served and when it will be consumed.",Bemidji State University,4554,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Waste,Wellbeing & Work,,Sustainability Office,,"food recovery,food waste,food security",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Anna Haynes,Student Worker,Bemidji State University,4554,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1415_Haynes_1619.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16849/1415_Haynes_1619.pptx,,,,,,
2307,Food Waste to Energy: Partnering with Dining Halls for Waste Diversion and Electrical Production,"Central CT State University has partnered with our food service vendor to collect food waste from our dining halls. The waste is brought to nearby Quantum BioPower where it produces clean, renewable energy through anaerobic digestion and production of biogas which is used to produce electricity. Since 2014, Connecticut has required any business that generates at least two tons of source-separated organic material per week to divert it for processing - as long as a facility is available within 20 miles. This presentation will describe how the project began with a pilot in one dining hall and has progressed to include the main dining facilities on campus. It will plot the methods used for collection of food waste, marketing and communications, logistics of transportation, quantities of waste diverted from the landfill, cost savings of the diversions, and greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The success of this program is due to the partnerships built with our food service vendor, Facilities staff, Sustainability staff, student interns, and interested faculty who have used this program as a teachable classroom project. Education about food waste to our student body has been well received and generated interested student volunteers in other areas of sustainable campus living.",Central Connecticut State University,4373,,,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Waste,Energy,,Dining Services,,"campus dining,biogas,renewable energy,waste diversion,food waste,waste-to-energy,biodigesters",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Karen Misbach,"Director of Environmental Health, Safety & Sustainability",Central Connecticut State University,4373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2230,Sustainable and Local Food Diversity and Affordability: Successful Procurement Case Studies,"Sustainable and local sourcing was once a movement of privilege used by high-end chefs to delight dining patrons. In this informative session, you will be taken into several case studies to explore how local and sustainable foods procurement can be a catalyst for diversity, inclusiveness, affordability and healthy access. FarmLogix, the leading technology platform for local and sustainable sourcing for institutions, will present three successful food programs that reach all neighborhoods and communities through statewide and regional collaborations between institutions that include universities, healthcare systems, and K-12 school districts. By providing a system to procure together everyone wins. Farms are provided with the forward contracting they need for economic sustainability, purchasing institutions, including universities, are provided the benefit of affordability through demand aggregation, and diverse communities are provided with local, healthy and sustainable foods with measurable outcomes. Learn how technology can be used to support collaborations, relationships and vital storytelling in this informative presentation. The presentation will be led by Linda Mallers, CEO of FarmLogix, and Carolyn Gahn, Sustainability Director for Aramark for the University of Kentucky Dining Services. FarmLogix' program was Google's Earth Week Podcast in 2018, and Linda Mallers speaks frequently on the use of technology to create food access and regional supply chains, most recently at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management and at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley. Carolyn Gahn is the Sustainability Director for Aramark for the University of Kentucky Dining Services. In this role, she oversees $2.5+ million dollars annual spend with local farms and businesses. Carolyn worked with local partners to create Aramark's signature farm-to-table programs, The Local Salad Bar and the Whole Animal Program, establishing an annual commitment-to-buy with local farms of 28,000 lbs. of organically grown produce and 72,000 lbs. of humanely raised beef and pork.","FarmLogix, LLC",6525,Aramark Higher Education,3691,,,,,,,,,Food & Dining,Diversity & Affordability,,,Dining Services,,"local foods,collaboration,food purchasing,local purchasing,affordability",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Linda Mallers,Business Representative,"FarmLogix, LLC",6525,Carolyn Gahn,Sustainability Manager,Aramark Higher Education,3691,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2521,The VCU Pocket Park: Creating a sustainability-oriented green space on a dynamic university campus,"Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) is a growing, changing university in the heart of the city of Richmond, VA. Green space is limited on this dense urban campus. The VCU Office of Sustainability is working with the VCU Urban and Regional Studies and Planning Department to create the university's first 'pocket park' as a way to create new green space, and potentially to improve existing green space by replicating successful park design elements elsewhere on campus in the future. In April 2019, students in the planning program will submit park designs for a small hardscape space on campus that is not currently utilized, which will be reviewed by sustainability and planning staff. Students must consider the following topics in their pocket park design: mitigating the urban heat island effect, managing stormwater runoff, supporting biodiversity in an urban area, integrating art into the space, incorporating sustainability educational opportunities into the space, and creating a space that supports health and wellness. Students are also encouraged to submit designs with a modular element or elements, so that the park infrastructure can potentially be altered, moved and/or replicated as the VCU campus changes. A student-created design or designs will serve as the foundation for the pocket park design and implementation. The aims of this pilot partnership include: 1) Creating a sustainability-oriented green space open to students, staff and community members. 2) Establishing a sustainable, replicable park design to potentially be implemented throughout campus in the future. 3) Highlight successful departmental partnership strategies. 4) Highlight the feasibility of increasing purposeful green space on campus through small projects (such as this pocket park).",Virginia Commonwealth University,1546,,,,,,,,,,,Grounds,Public Engagement,Curriculum,Design,Sustainability Office,,"green spaces,urban design,project based learning",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Sara Barton,Learning Garden Coordinator,Virginia Commonwealth University,1546,Sera Erickson,Bicycle Program Coordinator,Virginia Commonwealth University,1546,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Barton_1406.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18335/1445_Barton_1406.pptx,,,,,,
2120,How to Start an Herbicide-Free Campaign on Your Campus!,"Herbicide-Free UC's mission is to stop the use of toxic herbicides across all University of California campuses. We are currently at four UC campuses, but the UC system is just the start; we plan to take the campaign to the national level and mentor students at every university to start and carry out successful Herbicide-Free campaigns. This campaign has three major components that we will go over in our workshop: Groundskeeper Support & Engagement, Student Education, and Research. We teach students how to cultivate the necessary relationships with groundskeepers and learn the landscape needs of the campus, as well as what specific information and resources the groundskeepers need in order to reduce herbicide usage. We provide resources in the form of data, student support, financial support, as well as training and instruction for the groundskeepers in alternative maintenance methods. If students are interested in starting a campaign, we train them through a Campus Fellowship program. With support from Food & Water Watch, Herbicide-Free UC trains students to be effective campus organizers and educates them on how to work with the administration on transitioning to an herbicide-free campus. We also teach students how to conduct the necessary research on evaluating the costs of either a different relationship to weeds or a different approach to pest control. We teach them how to seek answers to the benefits, in groundskeeper, student, staff, and faculty health; in aesthetics; in food security; in environmental consequences, as well as what approach works best and how much it will cost. In order to institutionalize these efforts across the UC system, we offer support to develop consensus-based language for university policy as well as a system-wide best practices guides for campus units implementing this policy. College campuses can choose to go in two directions: take the opportunity to start a movement or wait to be held liable for culpable ignorance.","University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,Grounds,Campus Engagement,,,,,"herbicides,outreach campaigns,pesticides",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Mackenzie Feldman,Founder,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1015_Feldman_1309.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16858/1015_Feldman_1309.pdf,,,,,,

In addition, honeybees are responsible for pollinating about one-third of all food crops. However, honeybee populations have been declining at an alarming rate. Extensive research has been investigating what is causing this decline. Globally, apiculturists are exploring methods of protecting bee colonies from accidental destruction by various sources including pesticide use and climate change. At the state and local level, the South Carolina Beekeepers' Association serves to support local beekeeping associations through education and research grants. Locally, many people are asking the question, 'What can be done to protect the honeybee and increase its numbers across South Carolina?' The Rock Hill Educational Community Garden his home to two colonies where visitors are learning to overcome his or her fear of 'bees' while exploring the importance of local beekeeping, maintaining and protecting hives, and the process of harvesting honey. This poster will illustrate the benefits of local beekeeping on Winthrop University's campus and the need to protect honeybees. We will provide information about educational programs and national, state and local support available for those who are interested in the process of producing locally harvested raw honey for consumption. The authors have earned certification as Certified and Journeyman beekeepers successfully maintained colonies and successfully gained approval for bottling and labeling local honey for distribution.",Winthrop University,0144,,,,,,,,,,,Grounds,Campus Engagement,,,,,"bees,pollinators",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Christopher Johnson,Sustainability Coordinator,Winthrop University,0144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Johnson_1560.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17484/1530_Johnson_1560.pdf,,,,,,
1872,Creating a Buzz Across America: Supporting a Healthy Food Economy with Beekeeping,"Higher education is an ideal platform to champion environmental practices toward a sustainable economy. Community colleges are at the forefront of raising awareness of the role pollinators have on their campuses and in their communities. Join this lively conversation of three geographically diverse colleges as they demonstrate collaborative, student-centered, academic, and community initiatives in support of pollinators. Newly certified, Delta College will share their pathway to certification and their plans to meet the seven goals required of Bee Campus USA. You will learn about their well-developed pollinator gardens, a monarch migration plot, and the transition of a campus/community forest trail to a bee corridor complete with habitat, interpretive signage, and campus as a living lab opportunity. Their community 'Common Good' classroom introduces pollinator-focused learning including beekeeping, creating sustainable outdoor spaces, herbal living, and the impact of seasonal changes. Central Community College in Nebraska teaches basic and advanced beekeeping courses to turn a hobby into a profitable business. Student beekeepers are encouraged to shop locally for equipment, create products to sell, and provide products to local businesses such as building apiaries on the top of downtown businesses, organic farm pollination agreements, and providing ingredients for craft breweries and bakeries. Portland Community College established a nascent apiary in 2014 and has since grown its program in support of the college's Bee Campus USA designation. Current projects include using BroodMinder software to check winter hive health through temperature, weight and humidity and broadening the experiences for students in the beekeeping class to include making products from beeswax, learning formal honey tasting language, larvae extraction for queen rearing and pollen collection.

1899,Creating Living Laboratories Through Campus Ecological Restoration,"At Eastern Washington University we are currently working to restore 120 acres of campus farmland back to native habitat with the goal to preserve natural landscapes, sequester carbon, promote sustainable practices, and engage both the campus and Inland Northwest communities. EWU Faculty from across the curriculum are collaborating on how to use the space as a living laboratory to develop research projects and hands-on learning experiences for students. A network of multi-use trails will invite users to explore the landscape and connect with the bioregion. Historical and science-based signage will dot the area and inform visitors of the region's natural and cultural heritage, as well as the present-day research projects taking place onsite. Community organizations and individuals have been involved since the early stages of design and are active partners in developing plans, making this a truly collaborative project. The restoration project is a multi-year project and we are currently in the initial stages of project design and baseline data collection. Site development and planting of a pilot demonstration site of native grasses are scheduled for Fall 2019. Plants to be restored to the area include a long list of native grasses, forbs, and trees. We are working with non-profit, government, academic, and tribal agencies to identify the best options for restoration and to develop a seed bank for future planting. For this project to be successful and to meet the needs of the campus community, a diverse range of stakeholders are involved in the project. The EWU Office of Sustainability is charged with managing the project and working to coordinate activities and facilitate engagement across academic, operational, administrative, and community boundaries. Once completed this project will serve as a regional example on how to promote science, sustainability, outdoor recreation, exploration, and community engagement while restoring landscapes to their native state.",Eastern Washington University,7933,,,,,,,,,,,Grounds,Campus Engagement,,,Sustainability Office,,"living labs,ecological restoration",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Erik Budsberg,Sustainability Coordinator,Eastern Washington University,7933,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2299,Bees : How UTSA is Connecting Sustainability and Undergraduate Research Opportunities,"The University of Texas at San Antonio's newly established Office of Sustainability awarded the department of Environmental Science and Ecology funding for a 3 year program to facilitate the expansion of their pollinator program. This initiative is an extension of the on-going efforts of the office of Sustainability in promoting pollinators on campus as well as an effort to provide research opportunities for UTSA undergraduate students. The proposal included funding for student training, supplies, research, tuition relief, a small stipend, and student travel. The program commenced in the spring of 2019 with two current undergraduate students currently working on research projects. These students will present their findings at the 2020 International Pollinator Conference in the summer of 2020. This initial year of the program will be followed by two additional undergraduate students each of the following two years. This program will provide students the opportunity to work in a collaborative manner in pursuit of innovative solutions for addressing our society's environmental challenges, engage in applying this research knowledge to address our region's environmental needs, and in promoting sustainability policies and practices here at UTSA and beyond.

2008,Monetizing Campus Sustainability: Converting Operations Into Assets to Increase Revenues,"During the first couple of decades of growth in campus sustainability, 'green' operations were perceived as causing additional costs with limited direct paybacks. However, as sustainability has grown in college sports, operations such as zero waste, water conservation, local food, renewable energy, etc. have created a business model opportunity that enlightened brands are aligning with through corporate sponsorships. The same potential is also there for sustainability operations across campus to increase external sponsorship revenues as values-aligned brands seek authentic partners embraced by Millennials and Gen-Z students. In short, sustainable operations previously viewed as cost-centers are now increasingly seen as assets capable of winning revenues for the campus-and for sustainability departments. In this session, three seasoned campus sustainability and marketing professionals will review how campus operations need to be re-framed, bundled, and marketed. Examples from the University of Florida, the University of Colorado Boulder, and the University of Louisiana Lafayette sports programs will be demonstrated. Also, approaches to marketing campus-wide sustainability systems will be presented by the VP of the Learfield IMG College Campus + program which works with dozens of campuses to translate campus operations into monetizable assets. As a result of the session, attendees will understand how to redefine sustainability cost-centers into assets, how campuses market their systems, how additional revenues can boost the operations of campus sustainability offices, what the market for and appetite of potential brands sponsors may be, and lessons learned from examples of asset monetization already in place.",University of Colorado Boulder,2130,University of Louisiana at Lafayette,1617,Learfield IMG College,9511,,,,,,,Investment & Finance,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,Finance & Administration,Athletics & Recreation,"athletics,corporate partnerships,marketing,cost savings,revenue generation",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Dave Newport,"Director, Environmental Center",University of Colorado Boulder,2130,Monica Rowand,Sustainability Coordinator,University of Louisiana at Lafayette,1617,Megan Eisenhard,Business Representative,Learfield IMG College,9511,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Rowand_1429.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16462/1100_Rowand_1429.pdf,1100_Rowand_1429.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16462/1100_Rowand_1429.pptx,,,,

2037,Creating a Strong Alumni Base for Meaningful Engagement and Mutual Economic Benefit,"Many sustainability practitioners seek to engage alumni in various ways: fundraising, expertise, guest speakers, jobs/internships and mentorship for students. Learn from Lehigh University and the University of Virginia about how to start engaging alumni, growing your base and identifying new opportunities for developing relationships with alumni. This overview is intended to provide concrete examples of various opportunities to leverage sustainability and development and alumni relations' expertise to advance a strategy for alumni engagement and fundraising for campus sustainability. Some questions we will answer are how can you articulate the value of campus sustainability to alumni? How might that translate to additional engagement or donations? How do you leverage alumni engagement to best prepare students for success in a more just and sustainable economy? Long term, how can alumni engagement translate to higher level partnerships or research opportunities?

2315,Student Approved Projects on Campus: What Could Go Wrong and What Could Go Right?,"Like many universities, Western Michigan University has instituted a grant to fund student-led sustainable change on campus. What sets Western Michigan University apart, however, is that the allocations of these funds are controlled by students; administrators and staff only help while drafting the application. And that's not to say that Western Michigan University's grant structure is perfect, as students may not always choose the grants that are favored by sustainability professionals, but the positives of such a setup outweigh most concerns. This grant structure encourages students to be more involved in the process, to develop their own ideas, and to evaluate their peers' suggestions for what needs to be changed on campus. The autonomy granted to students to initiate and guide change on campus is powerful in that it emboldens and empowers tomorrows leaders to make changes today. The presentation will outline the positive aspects of this student-led grant initiative while addressing some areas of concern a brief history of how the program began will also be offered, hoping that other institutions might begin their own similar programs.

That is not true with everyone at the campus, and this presentation will show graphics and projects to entice the business office to pay attention. AASHE STARS does a fantastic job of gathering this data. Those involved understand and use this data to reduce operations and improve sustainability. However, not all campuses are able to implement STARS. Two national member associations that both belong to AASHE: facilities (APPA) and finance (NACUBO), joined forces to gather basic data on an elementary level. There are five years of data, and corresponding projects, from the APPA/NACUBO Key Facilities Metrics survey that can be brought forth to your finance or business office to encourage reduction of energy, electrical, water, waste, and carbon. See and hear innovative ways to present data, which can be used by students, staff, faculty, and senior administration for decision-making to improve campus costs and ecology.

1969,"Harvard's Campus Sustainability Innovation Fund: Bringing Students, Faculty, and Staff Together","In 2016, Harvard University enhanced its Living Lab Initiative by launching the Campus Sustainability Innovation Fund. This fund supports projects that use Harvard's campus or the neighboring community as a test bed for envisioning and piloting innovative solutions to sustainability challenges, including, but not limited to, climate and health. Projects tackle real-world challenges faced directly on campus or in the local community, and lead to the practical application of emerging technologies or strategies that can be used to inform the University's implementation of its Sustainability Plan. All project teams must include at least one student, one faculty member, and one staff member - to ensure that the projects are academically rigorous and operationally viable. By bringing diverse multi-disciplinary teams together, students have the chance to learn about real-world implementation challenges and staff members are able to access and test cutting-edge creative technologies and strategies. Now three years in, there is a multitude of lessons learned and successes to share. How do you make the case for a fund like this? What are some examples of the funded projects?

1904,Creating Positive Energy: Using Utility Rebates to Power Student-led Contributions to Society,"In the spring of 2019, Millersville University established a Positive Energy Award Program in celebration of the first-year anniversary of the University's positive energy Lombardo Welcome Center. The Positive Energy Award Program provides micro-grants to faculty, staff and students to complete projects that contribute positively to the local community using the Sustainable Development Goals framework. Projects encourage social entrepreneurship focused on goals such as ending poverty, fighting food insecurity, and combating climate change and link to the University's Climate Commitment obligations to support a regional climate change response in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. With 21 B Corporations, Lancaster has a growing social entrepreneur community that is directly working to create a sustainable economy. The Positive Energy Award Program seeks to foster this entrepreneurial spirit among Millersville's student to accelerate local solutions to the interconnected economic, social and environmental challenges confronting the world. Millersville established the award program funds using dollars from utility rebates associated with campus energy efficiency projects, including the University's zero/positive energy building.

2133,Moving Toward Climate Justice Through Divestment and Community Reinvestment,"All colleges have an endowment that they use to invest in a broad range of industries. Divestment is a powerful tactic where institutions can use their political and financial power to target the financial stability and social capital of companies profiting from injustice. Since 2011, the fossil fuel divestment movement has been taking root on campuses across the world, calling attention to the climate crisis and the role of the fossil fuel industry in causing this crisis. The movement has mobilized thousands of students to take action, and to date, over 140 colleges across the world have committed to fossil fuel divestment. We have seen how divestment is a powerful tactic to reduce the harmful corporate influence of immoral industries. Community-based reinvestment is another tactic that has been emerging from divestment as well as solidarity economy movements to further the vision of a 'just transition' from dirty, extractive energy to a renewable and equitable energy economy that works for all people. Through reinvestment, students and colleges have the opportunity to support and learn directly from the growing number of thriving, local economies built by and for communities who have been marginalized and disenfranchised by current oppressive systems of power. We will discuss the underlying moral and political arguments behind divestment, the basic financial considerations, the movement's current direction in centering climate justice and reinvestment, and go over a 'how-to' for a campaign. Participants will receive materials to help them start campaigns of their own and will be plugged into the national campus fossil fuel divestment network. As the organization facilitating this network, Divest Ed will also share our history and why student organizing work is essential to our mission of advocating for climate justice.",Better Future Project,8627,,,,,,,,,,,Investment & Finance,Public Engagement,,,Finance & Administration,,"divestment,endowment,climate justice,community partnerships,reinvestment",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Alyssa Lee,Director of Campus Programs,Better Future Project,8627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Lee_1827.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16896/1530_Lee_1827.pdf,,,,,,
1951,What is the Potential of Fossil Fuel Divestment in Higher Education? A Data-Driven Analysis,"Fossil fuel divestment has become a major activist movement in higher education, with campaigns at colleges and universities across the country. This movement has driven critical conversations about institutional responsibility in the face of climate change and acted as a training platform for the next generation of climate activists. Sustainability professionals have often, one way or another, found themselves involved in these conversations. Despite two recent high profile announcements, the rate of fossil fuel divestment announcements has slowed in the last 2 years. What is going on? We analyze a database of fossil-fuel divestment announcements along with endowment data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) to suggest that endowment dependence may play a significant role in which campaigns have succeeded to date. These constraints have strategic implications for fossil fuel divestment campaigns and their likely impact on higher education investment patterns. We will also discuss other climate-related leverage points that students and other activists may pursue within their educational communities.",Smith College,4705,,,,,,,,,,,Investment & Finance,,,,Finance & Administration,,"divestment,endowment,data",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Alex Barron,Assistant Professor - ES&P,Smith College,4705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2515,Fiduciary Duty and University Fossil Fuel Divestments,"One of the founding principles of Soka University of America is to 'foster leaders for the creative coexistence of nature and humanity.' Soka University has one of the highest endowments per students due to its very generous financial aid program. Universities must be a major part of the global fossil fuel divestment movement since it can help demonstrate their commitment to the altruistic values they inherently hold. The fiduciary responsibility of a university guides the board of trustees to act in the best interest of the institution. For Soka University of America, their best interest lies in maximizing returns in order to support scholarships for students and safeguard the endowment. The foundation of all university endeavors is based on its mission statement which is to foster a steady stream of global citizens committed to living a contributive life'. Most universities aim to maximize their short term returns at the cost of other factors. Many institutions often face an ethical dilemma where making enough returns to support students helps justify a policy of continuing to invest in fossil fuels. However, fiduciary duty encourages a diversified portfolio where a non-passive investment strategy is also acceptable. Moreover, ESG investments are contributing to long term risk assessments since investing in climate change is an imminent problem. Soka University recently invested 30 million of its endowment with Generation Investment Management LLP, a prestigious firm known for its strong commitment to constructing portfolios based on low-carbon, equitable, and high-performing sustainable companies. Unfortunately, fossil fuel divestments lower portfolio risks in the carbon bubble industry. This poster aims to explore alternative existing solutions from across the globe for universities to invest in Climate Change and help support a circular economy.

2012,The Role of Rural Campuses in Building Community Resilience and Responding to Extreme Weather,"Rural colleges/universities are often one of the driving cultural and economic forces in their region. As a result of this position, they can be a great resource in the community to convene stakeholders, accelerate climate action, and build climate adaptation to meet the needs of underserved impacted residents. This panel will highlight how campuses in rural areas are working with their communities to build a sustainable and resilient society in the face of a changing climate. While there are common elements to resilience at any institution, the diverse political and economic landscape for campuses in rural regions of the US is often different from that of urban or coastal areas. Features of rural regions include natural resources, open space, an economy reliant on agriculture and tourism sectors closely tied to climate, and a strong sense of community. These features impact how rural campuses are affected by climate change, and how they adapt. Three geographically diverse schools will describe responses to unnatural disasters of extreme weather. California State University-Chico will share how it was impacted by and responded to the Camp Fire and flooding, Central Community College extreme heat/cold events and rainfall shift, Black Hills State University Storm Atlas and Crow Peak fire, and Randolph College tornado and flooding events. The schools will discuss how resilience planning partnerships were formed, and how this will benefit the campus and community in the future. The conversation will also highlight different methods schools used to complete resilience assessments in the context of the Presidents' Climate Commitment. Each school will discuss how they identified assets, vulnerabilities, and initial indicators of resilience both on campus and in the surrounding communities.

Signatories to the commitment pledge to engage with the community beyond the academic institution, collaborating with other stakeholders to develop strategies for increasing resilience. In many ways, this is a more complex and daunting task than that of reducing carbon emissions. The presenter will draw on his experience leading this work at a liberal arts college located in a mid-sized community. The approach taken there has focused on using the college's resilience planning commitment to spur the broader community to also make resilience planning a priority. Thus a driving question: how can resilience planning efforts at a college catalyze action in the broader community? The success of the careful, step-by-step approach taken in this case highlights methods that can be used in other communities. This session will also provide examples of how a variety of institutions have tackled this task, with the aim of highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches.

1975,From Zero Energy to Energy+: Community-University-Industry Partnerships for Sustainable Housing,"From community design charrettes to international student design competitions, two housing research organizations at Penn State have collaborated with local affordable housing organizations and home builders to address long-term housing affordability since 2013. A prominent project within these partnerships was the research, design, and construction of an affordable net-zero energy duplex with a local Community Land Trust (CLT), the 2015 Department of Energy Race to Zero competition team, and a local design/build company. This presentation will examine the following dimensions of community-university-industry partnerships to sustainable affordable housing challenges: 1. The process, design, and impacts of the GreenBuild duplex project, a Zero Energy Ready Home (ZERH) duplex built in Penn State's host municipality (State College Borough) 2. How the significant number of lessons learned from the GreenBuild duplex project are informing the next emerging initiative to tackle energy efficiency and resiliency in existing affordable housing within these ongoing community-university-industry partnerships 3. The unique university constraints, opportunities, and lessons learned that make for these rich partnerships, including risk management issues and financial constraints 4.

1971,Spreading the Word: Crafting Communications Around Large Campus Sustainability Events,"UW Sustainability works with student groups and other organizations across campus in hosting two large-scale campus-wide sustainability events each year: the Sustainability Fair in October as part of Campus Sustainability Month, and Earth Day in April. These events provide an opportunity for UW Sustainability to connect with a campus audience which may not already know about or follow our regular communications, and provide our highest-visibility opportunities to connect with students, faculty and staff at the university. This session will detail the communications strategies behind promoting the events, and how we drive hundreds of attendees to these events through digital, print and targeted outreach across campus, as well as how we attempt to connect with attendees and get them to follow us on social media or sign up for emails so that we can continue to communicate with them after the event ends. In the past two years our office has particularly wanted to emphasize diversity, equity and environmental justice aspects of sustainability. Through these events, we've worked to include organizations and communities who may not have traditionally felt part of the sustainability conversations.

2194,Empowering Students and the Community Through Green Chemistry and Sustainable Science Outreach,"Sustainable STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) outreach can have a significant impact on youth, empowering students to be problem-solvers and engage in their communities as change makers, and inspiring students to pursue career paths in the sustainable STEM fields. This session will feature sustainable STEM outreach programs that utilize college students as role models and mentors to engage K-12 students and community members through hands-on activities demonstrating green chemistry and sustainable science innovations. Green chemistry is a pro-active approach to pollution prevention, which aims to reduce the intrinsic hazard of a chemical or material, rather than reduce exposure. As a solutions-based science, green chemistry focuses on innovating products in a more sustainable way that reduces waste, maximizes efficiencies, and relies on renewable resources. Beyond Benign, a non-profit organization dedicated to green chemistry education, it runs a community engagement program that uses hands-on activities to demonstrate innovative solutions to global challenges. This program develops college students into ambassadors of sustainable science to K-12 students and community members. Beyond Benign's program, along with additional College outreach programs, will be featured in this session. Through green chemistry and sustainable science outreach, students can engage in hands-on activities that demonstrate cutting edge technologies such as the Blackberry Solar Cell activity where students make solar cells from benign materials and test efficiencies, or an Ocean Plastics activity to learn about the issue of plastics in the oceans and explore innovative solutions. Through hands-on activities, K-12 students and community members can better understand the role of STEM in providing solutions to these challenges. This session will feature hands-on activities that can be immediately implemented in existing environmental and STEM outreach programs on campuses",Beyond Benign,7596,State of Washington,9521,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,Curriculum,,,,"k-12,green chemistry,STEM,sciences",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Irv Levy,"Director, Green Chemistry Commitment",Beyond Benign,7596,Saskia van Bergen,"Green Chemistry Scientist, Department of Ecology",State of Washington,9521,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_vanBergen_1516.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17036/0915_vanBergen_1516.pdf,,,,,,
2349,Bringing the Campus Community Together Through Gardening and Gardening Workshops,"The Garden Commons is a community garden space on the campus of the University of Louisville, located next to the Cultural Center and the Student Activities Center. It exists as an open space for students, staff, faculty and community members. At the Garden Commons, we offer education through various different workshops throughout the year that touch on numerous topics having to do with urban agriculture and sustainability. We also offer regular workdays where people are welcome to come to the Garden and learn about gardening. These workshops offer a springboard for conversations about sustainability and engagement with agriculture in an urban campus setting. The Garden also offers access to fresh fruits and vegetables during the growing season; this access is important because bringing fresh, organic produce to campus can help improve overall student health - not to mention, many students at University of Louisville report food insecurity. Finally, one of the most important parts of the Garden Common's message is that the Garden Commons is a successful experiment in the gift economy. Anyone may take from the Garden, regardless of their involvement. By implementing this accessible, free green space on campus for the purpose of urban agricultural education and engagement, we provide an example for other universities. Successful engagement through a community garden when it's part of the university landscape offers a blank canvas for many different learning opportunities. Outlined in the proposal are several examples of workshops we have lead and partnerships we have created; 'Seed Starting' is one example of a workshop where we partnered with the Jefferson County Agricultural Extension Services to offer education and also engage people to start the seeds that would later be planted in the Garden. These various workshops offer diverse opportunities to learn that reflect our diverse student body and could easily be applicable in many different collegiate settings.",University of Louisville,1647,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,,"gardens,urban agriculture,food security",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Avalon Gupta VerWiebe,Undergraduate Student,University of Louisville,1647,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_GuptaVerWiebe_1481.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17455/1100_GuptaVerWiebe_1481.pptx,,,,,,
1867,Growing Sustainable Communities Together Through Leadership in Higher Education,"The South Metropolitan Higher Education Consortium (SMHEC) is a unique partnership of 10 higher education institutions in the south metropolitan area of Chicago extending west to Joliet, south to Kankakee and east to the Indiana state-line. Our members are two and four-year, public, private and for-profit degree-granting institutions, which provide a distinct opportunity to address key issues with one, stronger voice. In 2014, SMHEC launched a regional effort to 'link' and 'leverage' community resources to make the Chicago southland the 'greenest region.' Communities within SMHEC's boundaries began meeting regularly to share success, identify areas of opportunities and leverage resources. In 2016, our key stakeholders made the decision to create three distinct sub-regions, identified through community college boundaries, to begin and expand sustainability efforts. Through this, the Will County region, Prairie State region and Alsip region were developed to connect people, communities and resources to make lasting improvements to each region's economy, ecology and social equity. In 2018, to demonstrate their collaborative commitment to sustainability and the communities they serve, Joliet Junior College, Lewis University and the University of St. Francis made a formal commitment to link and align existing sustainability efforts to build and leverage relationships between all stakeholders including government, higher education, businesses, non-profit entities and community members, and to establish an infrastructure to support the activities of the network. As a result of SMHEC's link and leverage efforts, two large-scale sustainability conferences have been hosted and two formal networks have been launched to expand sustainability efforts in the communities within SMHEC's boundaries. This session will address the creation of these networks, the benefits and challenges faced working with multiple sectors, and the results seen to date.",Prairie State College,2552,Joliet Junior College,2163,University of Saint Francis,2877,Lewis University,4227,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,,"regional collaboration,inter-campus collaboration,community partnerships",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Allessandra Kummelehne,Executive Director,Prairie State College,2552,maria anna rafac,Professor/Sustainability Coordinator,Joliet Junior College,2163,Janine Hicks,Sustainability Coordinator,University of Saint Francis,2877,John Lerczak,Sustainability Staff,Lewis University,4227,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Kummelehne_1172.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16030/0915_Kummelehne_1172.pdf,,,,,,
2004,Green STEAM: Rocket Fuel for a Sustainable Economy,"For decades, the environmental movement has been trying to infuse sustainability into the mainstream ethos. While the science is irrefutable, most people are not moved by science alone. One example of this was the wide held myth that smoking is a harmless habit despite the scientific consensus to the contrary. This myth was dispelled within a generation through creative education campaigns. These campaigns brought a toxic industry to its knees. Similarly, college campuses can inspire future green leaders through dynamic public engagement and help usher in an emerging green economy. During the first part of this session, Joey 'FineRhyme' Feinstein will share STEAM-based approaches to learning which are designed to delight and educate the audience about sustainability. These include raptivism (activism through rap), repurposed fashion, and bringing environmental science to life through storytelling. He will also share the pedagogy behind these techniques while showcasing a pedal powered (actual bicycle!) sound system that will amplify sound for the duration of the presentation. Subsequently, Stephenie Presseller and Deb Kutska will - describe how public and student engagement through STEAM has been extremely successful - provide examples of other STEAM related, co-curricular activities that can be replicated on campuses - discuss the results of this method of delivering STEAM to students and working with Joey through different events This presentation will help audience members think about and develop fresh and innovative ways to engage their campus and student body around sustainability. It aligns with the theme of co-creating a sustainable economy as college students will become both the future leaders of the economy and the most high-powered consumers. The issues they care about will steer the economy at large along with their personal purchasing decisions.

2088,Sustainable Energy Education Through Demonstration (SEED) in Secondary Education,"Sustainable Energy Education through Demonstration (SEED) is a ten-week program that educates students on the mechanics of renewable energy production and the value of these energies in combating climate change. This program was designed by undergraduate students at State University of New York at Geneseo who are passionate about sustainability and was successfully administered by these students at the nearby Geneseo Central School. SEED attracts students from a multitude of backgrounds, especially those interested in the natural sciences. It inspires them to pursue careers or higher education degrees related to sustainability or simply gain a better understanding of how sustainability can become a part of their adult lives. High school students involved in the program garner a better understanding of the issues of anthropogenic climate change and environmental degradation, how different forms of renewable energy function, and what sustainability initiatives look like in their own community. Through this program, students became more engaged in issues relating to sustainability, all the while creating a greater connection between the local college and the central school. SEED fills a vital role in a holistic, sustainability-minded education that also connects high school students to college students in their community. This program is an opportunity for undergraduates to hone their knowledge of sustainability and practice teaching about environmental conservation. It is the first program of its kind at State University of New York at Geneseo and is laying the groundwork for college to high school sustainability education, region and nationwide.",State University of New York at Geneseo,1442,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,,"renewable energy,community engagement,K-12,student engagement",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Scott Williams,Undergraduate Student,State University of New York at Geneseo,1442,Catherine Fedor,Undergraduate Student,State University of New York at Geneseo,1442,Grant Grieble,Undergraduate Student,State University of New York at Geneseo,1442,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2469,Sustainable Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network,"This networking meeting will be an opportunity for attendees interested in, researching, and/or implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are a set of 17 goals to be achieved by 2030, developed through a comprehensive dialogue convened by the United Nations and adopted by 193 countries around the world. At present, no country, US state, or US city are on track to achieve these far-reaching goals. They center on six main transformations, all underpinned by the Leave No One Behind Agenda: (1) Education, Gender, and Inequality; (2) Health, Well-being, and Demography; (3) Energy Decarbonization and Sustainable Industry; (4) Sustainable Food, Land Use, Water, and Oceans; (5) Sustainable Cities and Communities; and (6) Digital Revolution for Sustainable Development. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), convenes universities and research institutions to mobilize research, action, education, and collaboration on the SDGs. There are thirty-three National and Regional Networks around the world, including one in the United States, as well as a number of thematic networks centered on specific issue areas such as Sustainable Cities and Data and Statistics. The US chapter has over 120 members from 44 states, Washington DC, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The purpose of this networking meeting is to invite AASHE conference attendees who are working on the SDGs or curious about them to convene, network, and discuss opportunities for collaboration. The SDSN USA team will be present to share ideas and discuss the activities of the global networks, and we hope that others will join us and share examples of their own initiatives.",Sustainable Development Solutions Network,8936,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,,,,,,"networking,Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Caroline Fox,SDSN USA,Sustainable Development Solutions Network,8936,Alainna Lynch,Senior Research Manager,Sustainable Development Solutions Network,8936,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2343,"Challenges, Successes, and Opportunities of Collegiate Farming","The Colgate Community Garden was started in 2011 by Green Thumbs, a student group that works to manage and promote the activities of the garden. The purpose of the garden is to serve as an educational space providing students and community members first-hand opportunities to learn about small-scale, sustainable agriculture. We produce over 30 different kinds of organic vegetables and 20 different herbs. Half of this food is donated to the local food cupboard, and the other 50% is sold at our weekly farmstand or to local businesses. The garden is operated by student interns along with a part-time garden manager. Additionally, there are 11 plots that are rented by community members. Despite the many successes since its establishment, the garden has also faced many challenges. The garden has been moved twice throughout the years, and will likely change sites again in 2020. Currently the garden is situated a fair distance from main campus, and this can make it difficult to have many students actively aware of the garden and the activities held there. We also lost our greenhouse two years ago, due to a winter storm. While this was an unfortunate event as the greenhouse allowed us to start seedlings and get a head start on the growing season, we are optimistic about future plans regarding new ways to utilize the space. Within the past year, we have struggled to gain involvement with Green Thumbs. The group has had difficulty finding dedicated members, and without this group the future of the garden is unknown. However, the lull in engagement may prove as an opportunity to revamp the group and find new ways to promote student support of the garden. We have suggested that the group have a stronger focus on food security and reimagining the garden's role in the local food system.

2474,Breaking the Bubble: Using Video to Demystify Sustainable Living,"This poster presentation details an online video series entitled 'What Can You Do to Live More Sustainably.' Nine videos featuring students, staff and faculty across the University of Kentucky provide accessible information to learn more about actions people can take to live more sustainably. These videos include three important characteristics: the knowledge and communication style of the interviewee; the video duration; and the simple, concrete and unexpected elements of the video which make the ideas stick. Each interviewee is well-recognized within their peer-networks. Working as brokers, the interviewees bridge various networks and provide information to make sustainable living more accessible. Based on research, video attention spans only lasts for two minutes before the audience will click away from the online content. Therefore, these videos were designed to be one minute segments. One-minute videos work with social media because they upload easily and are short enough to engage audiences. For example, one of the videos features the University of Kentucky Chair of the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences. She discusses the importance of soil health and plant yields, but then transitions to the social impacts of food insecurity and how viewers can live more sustainably by making smart food purchasing choices. This video series was designed to 'stick' by ensuring the videos conveyed enough information to engage and educate without alienating audiences new to the conversation.",University of Kentucky,1600,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,,"videos,community engagement,communications",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Hannah Phillips,Student,University of Kentucky,1600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Phillips_1885.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18103/1100_Phillips_1885.pdf,,,,,,

2143,Recipes for Effective Campus-Community Partnerships: Perspectives on Food Security & Justice,"This combined session will present two cases of campus-community partnerships centered on food. The Stone Soup Collective College of Charleston Chapter is comprised of dozens of collectivists and volunteers who collaborate with local community partners to create and distribute plant-based soup to build and nourish a community. Exemplifying the tenet that wealth does not equal money, this highly collaborative and empowering collective utilizes the hidden wealth in its community, whether it be an underutilized kitchen at a senior center, the knowledge of a local chef, or an excess of 'ugly fruit' summer squash. In this session, we strive to highlight how this nexus was formed and the value of redefining 'wealth' to include the realignment of existing resources to directly address food security. The University of Utah Campus-Community Food Justice project approaches sustainability through an equity lens. The project engages partnerships to uncover key themes for food justice. The West Side of Salt Lake City, one of the most ethnically diverse areas of the city, also includes several USDA designated 'Food Deserts.' While food is being grown here in small farms and community gardens, systemic barriers to food sovereignty persist. This presentation will discuss multiple phases of a participatory action research project, including an examination of an urban CSA farm, local residents' perceptions of the farm, and their desires and visions regarding broad scope food access and justice initiatives. The project uncovers shared challenges that many organizations both internal and external to this community face in their efforts to address food insecurity and uses findings to shape campus garden projects in hopes of creating inclusive landscapes.

2352,A Collaborative Approach to Sustainability and Inclusion at the 2018 Special Olympics USA Games,"This bright, colorful presentation and discussion will cover the value and importance of a cross-functional team and holistic sustainability strategy for large-scale events. We will share the story of how we created and implemented a comprehensive sustainability strategy for the first time at the Special Olympics USA Games, hosted primarily by 3 Seattle universities in July 2018. In this session, we will share the creative approach that led to sustainability being embraced by the Organizing Committee, the essential role of the Sustainability Advisory Committee that was created, and the key lessons learned around each of the six pillars of the sustainability strategy: accessibility & inclusion, waste & recycling, food & beverage, responsible sourcing, transportation, and education & legacy. The mission of the Special Olympics is to empower athletes with intellectual disabilities (ID) with year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports. The Special Olympics USA Games, hosted in Seattle, WA, July 1-6 2018, were the first USA Games ever to create and implement a comprehensive sustainability strategy. The University of Washington, Seattle University and Seattle Pacific University were each host venues for events along with five other Seattle-area facilities. The Games welcomed 10,000 athletes and coaches from across the country along with over 7,500 family members, 15,000 volunteers and an estimated 120,000 spectators throughout the week. A key legacy project was to create a Playbook & Toolkit that could be shared with future Special Olympics USA Games and state programs. Many of the key elements are transferrable to a wide range of large- and small-scale events. In collaboration with Seattle U. Department of Sports Management, we were able to survey athlete families both before and after the Games and learn about how our sustainability and inclusion initiatives impacted their experience and post-Games thoughts and behaviors.",Elysium Events LLC,9528,Playback Sports,9520,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,"disability access,inclusion,athletics,planning",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,David Muller,Sustainability Consultant,Elysium Events LLC,9528,Karlan Jessen,2018 Special Olympics USA Games,Playback Sports,9520,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Muller_1492.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17464/1100_Muller_1492.pdf,,,,,,

2401,"The Importance of Community, Culture, History, and Education for Sustainability","In this presentation I will share the story of Keokuk, Iowa - my hometown - a river town community along the Mississippi River, which is considered the most dangerous town in Iowa and the town with the highest poverty. Keokuk (population around 10,000) is located in the southeast corner of Iowa and is a beautiful community, however it struggles with low wages, alcohol and drug addiction, environmental pollution, etc... name something negative and most likely you will find it in Keokuk. One woman from Iowa described, 'Keokuk [as] a place you don't go out after dark'. However, Keokuk also has a rich history that includes Teddy Roosevelt, Mark Twain, and Roger Maris. In this case study I will introduce audience members to this Midwest community. I will explain the issues the town is facing and I will highlight the interesting history and culture and discuss the people who call Keokuk home. Then, my presentation will focus on the importance of community members knowing and understanding a community's history. I argue the importance of local schools teaching about a community's cultural history and connecting people from today with people from the past. I also discuss community education, which I believe will help engage citizens, increase 'hometown' pride, and spark community revitalization. In my presentation I will discuss how communities can create community education programs to promote cultural education and improve morale and motivate sustainable change.

2030,Weatherization Programs: Partnerships to Address Community Issues,"The benefits of weatherization programs are extensive. These programs have the capacity to address social and economic inequality, the historical effects of gentrification, and the growing impacts of climate change on our most vulnerable communities. Furthermore, they offer an avenue to promote sustainable economic development by freeing up resources otherwise spent on utilities that residents can then invest in their homes and communities. Universities involved with weatherization programs have a unique form of engagement with the community that emphasizes peer learning, face-to-face interaction, equity, and addressing disproportionate utility burdens of underserved, low-income residents. Both the University of Florida and Furman University have embraced the opportunity to be involved with/in a weatherization program. At the University of Florida, working with the local non-profit Community Weatherization Coalition (CWC) has allowed them to expand their programming to serve more homes than ever before. CWC's intensive training engages volunteers throughout the community to address a locally specific issue of racial inequity, especially when it comes to utility burdens. Furman University's weatherization program, the Community Conservation Corps (CCC), began 10 years ago with a mission to reduce energy consumption, promote the financial stability of homeowners, and increase environmental awareness in the surrounding community. Data collected through these programs has proven that home weatherization can save homeowners hundreds of dollars on their energy bills each year, offering them more leverage in the development of a sustainable local economy. Involvement with these programs has offered the universities many lessons in terms of best practices for community engagement, the role of universities on a local level, and the need for action in addressing inequalities.",Furman University,3836,University of Florida,2088,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Energy,,,,,"weatherization,cost savings,community engagement",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Hannah Dailey,Program Coordinator,Furman University,3836,Fiona Hogan,Strategic Projects Manager,University of Florida,2088,Kelly Grant Purvis,Associate Director of Sustainability Programs,Furman University,3836,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Dailey_1555.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16546/0915_Dailey_1555.pptx,,,,,,
1940,Rooted in Community: Collaboration with Local Land Trusts,"As higher education institutions, and specifically sustainability offices, seek to broaden and deepen collaboration with local organizations, the land trust community is a natural partner. In many cases, both the college/university and the local land trust have a long history and retain an anchor presence in a city or rural area. Both entities bear significant responsibility for shaping local land use patterns, environmental impacts, and sense of place. The presentation will offer perspectives from two institutions, a small, private, liberal-arts institution and a large, public, doctoral institution, who have forged strong partnerships with local land trusts. The respective land trusts also offer unique perspectives. Specifically, the mission of the Freshwater Land Trust in Birmingham, Alabama includes traditional land conservation initiatives along with a flagship urban trail system, developed through inclusive planning processes, that accessibly connects communities, protects watersheds, and promotes multi-modal transportation. In contrast, the Davidson Lands Conservancy seeks to provide the citizens of Davidson and surrounding areas alternatives to urban living by protecting natural lands and other open spaces for ecological and aesthetic purposes. This session seeks to acquaint attendees with the land trust movement, including its history, mechanisms for land protection, culture, and current priorities as identified in the Land Trust Alliance's Standards and Practices. The presenters are both higher education sustainability directors who serve on boards of their local land trusts. Through these dual roles, the presenters will articulate shared strategic goals between the two professional fields and draw on their own experiences as well as examples from other institutions to share successful town-gown partnerships and the resulting community-wide impacts.",University of Alabama at Birmingham,4407,Davidson College,8012,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Grounds,,,,,"town-gown,community partnerships,conservation,land use",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Julie Price,Sustainability Manager,University of Alabama at Birmingham,4407,Yancey Fouche,Director of Sustainability,Davidson College,8012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Price_1595.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16237/1400_Price_1595.pptx,,,,,,

2377,Building Bridges Through Reuse,"For this session, the presenters will focus on the Hoosier to Hoosier Sale at Indiana University Bloomington (IU). The Hoosier to Hoosier Community Sale is a reuse program that aims to divert waste from the landfill in Terre Haute, Indiana, reduce resource consumption by selling the collected items to the university and the local community, and raise funds for local organizations. From an environmental perspective, this program alleviates the harm that comes from landfills and the transportation required to get the waste to the landfill. From a social standpoint, the Hoosier to Hoosier Sale is a program that engages the community and allows for people from all demographics to work together toward a common goal. There are also economic sustainability aspects to this program, which can be most visible by examining the flow of money within the program. The money made from the diverted waste is used to compensate the volunteer groups, institutions, and intern that help divert waste and make the sale possible. The flow of money is a closed loop that benefits organizations in the Bloomington, Indiana area. The Hoosier to Hoosier Sale is an initiative that encompasses all three pillars of sustainability: environmental, social, and economic. Although the Hoosier to Hoosier Sale encompasses all three pillars of sustainability, the presentation will focus on campus engagement and culture. Community engagement, and social sustainability, in general, are an important part of sustainability that is often disregarded. Without partnerships and community engagement, it becomes difficult to meet a sustainability agenda, such as diverting waste and reducing resource consumption. The Hoosier to Hoosier Sale is a partnership between Indiana University, the City of Bloomington, Cutters Soccer Club and The Warehouse and allows for IU students and community members to be involved through donating, volunteering, and shopping.",Indiana University Bloomington,6354,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Waste,,,,,"reuse,community engagement,resale,waste diversion",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Amanda Keene,Student,Indiana University Bloomington,6354,Steve Akers,Indiana University,Indiana University Bloomington,6354,Makayla Bonney,Sustainability Staff,Indiana University Bloomington,6354,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Akers_1663.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17530/1100_Akers_1663.pdf,,,,,,

We have some thoughts and experiences to share. Furman University, a liberal arts school, focuses on engaged learning throughout our students' four-year experience. In order to broaden our range of experiences, we partner with many organizations throughout the local community on numerous research projects and internship opportunities. The David E. Shi Center for Sustainability operates a sustainability-focused Student Fellows Program that allows students to work with local organizations and government entities to benefit their education and their community at the same time. Given the wide reaching nature of sustainability, we work hard to partner with diverse organizations to provide experiences that appeal to students in all majors offered at Furman. These opportunities are possible because both endowed and grant funding provides stability and consistency for the program. The David E. Shi Center funds all the salaries for our student fellows giving us an advantage over programs that share funding and/or offer unpaid opportunities for students. These advantages include requiring project-focused experiences for our students, working with organizations that are too small or too underfunded to support an internship alone, and providing needed assistance to locally owned small businesses or nonprofits in the startup phase. Additionally, students are able to make these fellowships the focus of their summer because their financial needs are met; and our community partners gain much needed, highly skilled labor to further their work. With ten years and over 300 fellowships supported to date, we have experienced the benefits and the pitfalls of funding an engaged learning program that partners with the community. We will share these experiences and detail the aspects of the program's funding that have allowed us to provide so many rich student experiences.",Furman University,3836,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,Campus Engagement,,,,,"funding,internships,student engagement,community engagement",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Kelly Grant Purvis,Associate Director of Sustainability Programs,Furman University,3836,Weston Dripps,Executive Director,Furman University,3836,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2408,How Do We Build a Bridge Between Science and Decision Making? Narratives Matter,"Every decision is being made at in local, regional, national and global contexts. Researchers at universities are discovering solutions to be more sustainable and community colleges are equipping students to succeed in a four-year university or in their workplace. This proposal presents the best practices of Yale students of the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and Sociology students of Cedar Valley Community College (CVC). These students did a joint research project that resulted in a multi-stakeholder analysis with the PESTEL methodology to determine the core values of each group. Then a narrative was developed to talk about sustainable economic development based on these values. The students of both institutions worked on a proposal that solved the main challenges of southern Dallas County, where Cedar Valley is located. With concepts of regenerative economy a 'Learning- Living Center was proposed to address the challenges of mobility, food insecurity and affordable housing, that were determined by the sociology students of CVC. This is an example of how career pathways were strengthened by doing undergraduate research between a 2 year and 4 year higher education. The project-based model worked well to incorporate the concepts of both courses and encourage critical thinking skills to improve the quality of life of the community. We will share what worked and what didn't work and how we have kept the project going for almost 3 years. Data is being collected on student success that will be analyzed in the summer semester to present at AASHE. The question that will be answered are: has the collaboration of these students in a real life project enhanced their learning? Are they better stewards of the people planet and prosperity of their communities?

In 2010, UCLA began piloting the use of a survey tool to measure licensees' readiness and levels of progress on key metrics for supply chain management including transparency, risk, mitigation, and purchasing practices. Licensee responses were compared to the supporting documentation they submitted as well as external data sources to verify accuracy of the responses. Results were summarized, scored and subsequently used by UCLA to select companies to receive new or renewed license contracts. By comparing a licensee's scorecard results from year to year UCLA was empowered to select and award renewal agreements to those licensees who progressively demonstrated greater levels of compliance-ready management systems and implementation of best practices over those licensees who did not.","University of California, Los Angeles",4167,,,,,,,,,,,Public Engagement,,,,,,trademark licensing,10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Cynthia Holmes,"Director, UCLA Trademarks & Licensing","University of California, Los Angeles",4167,Elizabeth Kennedy,"Director, Ethical Labor and Sustainability, Trademarks & Licensing","University of California, Los Angeles",4167,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Holmes_1803.ppt,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16340/1400_Holmes_1803.ppt,,,,,,

2407,Data-Driven Sustainability: How Universities Can Use Data to Make Ethical Licensing Decisions,"Poor working conditions at a factory in China that manufactures t-shirts bearing a university's logo aren't that university's problem, right? Wrong. Universities are increasingly called to account (in a very public way!) when factories licensed to use their logos practice forced labor or harm the surrounding environment. The bad news: Even universities committed at their cores to sustainability have historically struggled to attain the data essential to making business decisions that keep people, revenue, and the planet in mind; factory workers and the environment suffer as a result. The good news: Things are changing. Universities can (and some already do) use social and environmental data to get a snapshot of factory conditions and licensee ethical sourcing practices, and then collaborate with business partners to cultivate improvement where it's needed. In this way, universities can proactively use information on ethical sourcing performance to make decisions about who is acceptable for them to work and grant logo licenses to. This session will offer evidence-based advice about how data can be used to make ethical licensing and sourcing decisions at the university level. Get ready to discover-via discussion and a mini case-study-which data is ripe for the picking, which tools universities can use to gather it (sorry, it's not free), and what they can do with it when they have it.

2480,"Can Buying Better Products Help Reverse Global Warming? Toward Circular, Carbon-Storing Procurement","What does Procurement have to do with global warming? Research indicates that the embodied carbon (the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere from product supply chains, manufacturing and transport) purchased by many higher education institutions may be far in excess of the carbon emissions resulting from all other operations. Beginning with emerging strategies in the building products sector for reducing embodied carbon of purchased materials, we will engage participants in imagining a world where we can sequester excess carbon from the atmosphere in everything we buy and help reverse global warming.",Interface Americas,4908,,,,,,,,,,,Purchasing,Air & Climate,,,Purchasing/Procurement,,"carbon sequestration,green purchasing,carbon footprint,scope 3 emissions",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Mikhail Davis,"Interface Americas, Inc.",Interface Americas,4908,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Davis.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18171/0915_Davis.pptx,,,,,,
2042,Improving Health in the Built Environment Through a Class-Based Approach to Chemicals of Concern,"This panel introduces purchasers (and manufacturers) to the targeted chemical class-based approach to help provide clarity grounded in science about how to avoid the most common chemicals of concern in everyday products. This framework can be easily understood and applied to prevent the all-too-common 'chemical whack-a-mole' problem, where one harmful chemical is eliminated from a product only to be replaced by a related chemical that has a similar harmful profile. This approach protects well-intended healthier materials goals from falling short of the desired sustainability and well-being outcomes. Harvard University and the Center for Environmental Health will present how they have used this approach to shift procurement to healthier products while mitigating performance and cost concerns. Our panel will cover the health, environmental and financial rationale for categorizing chemicals by class, demonstrating how the class concept reduces harmful chemicals in the supply chain. Participants will learn how to get started and use newly developed tools and resources -including scientific documents, specifications and how-tos for project teams and suppliers. Participants will be able to apply a chemical class-based approach to purchasing healthier products including furniture, carpeting and foodware. Harvard will discuss using its own campus as a living lab, bringing students, faculty, and staff together to pilot impactful ideas and promising new solutions that address real-world sustainability challenges, including health in the built environment. To target chemical classes of concern in the built environment, Harvard is working with a diverse group of stakeholders to pilot and institutionalize healthier materials into its capital projects and operations-addressing the challenges of systemic sustainable purchasing as a model to scale this work and help other organizations ground their strategies in the latest science and get results.",Harvard University,4451,Center for Environmental Health,8979,,,,,,,,,Purchasing,Buildings,Curriculum,,,,"environmental health,human health,chemicals,built environment,building occupants,living labs",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Heather Henriksen,"Managing Director, Office for Sustainability",Harvard University,4451,Judy levin,Pollution Prevention Director,Center for Environmental Health,8979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2279,Outdoor Program Gear Purchasing: Applying Leave No Trace Ethics to Create a Circular Economy,"This session will explore how outdoor programs can become more sustainable in regard to purchasing, maintenance, and transportation while effectively educating the student population on these topics. Presenters are two student trip leaders from University of North Carolina Asheville and Auburn University, who both work closely with their campus' sustainability offices as well as their outdoor programs departments. The 2017 Outdoor Recreation Economy Report stated that the outdoor economy commerce is responsible for $887 billion dollars annually with $20 billion coming from trail sports gear alone. While Outdoor Programs units on campus emphasize Leave No Trace (LNT) ethics to protect the lands they use, they typically spend less time discussing the impact that gear manufacturing, other supplies, and transportation have on the environment. Learning how programs can, with a limited budget, purchase sustainably, repair gear effectively, and teach students the importance of purchasing sustainable gear is a necessary next step in the industry. Through local purchasing, proper evaluation of gear specs, and developing better in-house repair capacity, campus-based outdoor recreation programs can contribute to sustainability education and engagement goals. Often, campuses and universities Outdoor Programs are a student's first adventure in the outdoors. In light of that, programs have a responsibility to bring LNT principles and other sustainability considerations to students early and often.","University of North Carolina, Asheville",4237,Auburn University,1910,,,,,,,,,Purchasing,Campus Engagement,,,,,"outdoor learning,leave no trace,on-campus collaboration",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Cade Justad-Sandberg,Co-Director of the Student Environmental Center,"University of North Carolina, Asheville",4237,Ferrell Sullivan,Sustainability Staff,Auburn University,1910,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2423,Leveraging Institutional Buying Power for Sustainable Procurement: A Strategizing Session,"Many colleges and universities have separate conversations with the same suppliers. Imagine the impact we could have on the environment if higher ed coordinated sustainability requests of these companies and their supply chains! Increasingly, campuses are seeking to use purchasing power to drive sustainability goals yet lack the leverage, as a single institution, to shift supplier behavior. At the same time, some suppliers are seeking to integrate more sustainability value into their services yet have limited understanding of campus sustainability priorities. This networking session aims to bring together higher ed institutions that are interested in sustainable procurement. Specifically, it aims to identify strategic areas that institutions can work together on to drive sustainable procurement. Key topics that will be addressed include: 1) Where might a collective voice among higher ed purchasers help to shift supplier behavior towards a partnership that helps campuses solve supply chain driven campus impacts? 2) What scales of collective voice might best serve higher ed institutions? Perhaps we develop a collective ask for specific national-scale suppliers and see regional-scale alignment for regional suppliers? 3) How can sustainability staff build trusting relationships with procurement staff so that sustainability staff can become more involved in large-scale procurement decisions, such as the RFP process for new suppliers and performance review of existing suppliers? What are best practices among peers that can be shared and replicated? 4) What are key supply chains that sustainability staff should focus on? (e.g., apparel, food, electronics, cleaning supplies, furniture, etc.) Where do sustainability offices have greatest leverage to drive impactful outcomes? 5) What are key questions that should be asked of suppliers and key sustainability priorities to emphasize with suppliers?

1864,Supply Chain Partnerships: MSU and SPLC Pilot BENCHMARK in Higher Ed Operations,"Organizations around the world have recognized the need for supply chain sustainability in order to reduce the environmental, social and economic impacts of their purchasing while protecting and delivering value to their operations, products and services. Whether your organization is just beginning this journey or has been leading the way, a common set of questions exist: What does a leading sustainable purchasing program look like? How does my organization measure up to this? How am I doing compared to my peers? What can I learn from this information? How do I most efficiently and effectively plan our organization's next steps to become a global leader in sustainable purchasing? Higher Ed is no exception. Michigan State University has partnered with SPLC (Sustainable Purchasing Leadership Council) to pilot BENCHMARK in our facilities and operations supply chain. While MSU is actively improving the carbon and water impact of our supply chain, the value of BENCHMARK will help assess the maturity of our work, effectiveness, improve risk, demonstrate leadership and allow us to more efficiently formalize our program across the organization.

Passing Sustainable Purchasing Policies or Procedures can help empower employees of schools to be creative and include a lens of sustainability when purchasing. This session will provide an overview of Bow Valley College's 2018-2019 sustainable purchasing initiative. This was a three-tiered process: a) introducing sustainability into all of our competitive bids, b) working with individual departments to respond to and shape their unique purchasing needs, and c) aligning our language and initiatives with the college's wider values and new strategic plan. This session will also include a practical overview on how competitive bids are scored when vendors submit them to the college (approximately 10 min of the presentation). This session will focus on the distinct struggles small public institutions face when trying to implement sustainable purchasing initiatives. The failures, successes, and complexities from Bow Valley College's story will be shared in the first half of the session. The second half of the session will be facilitated as a problem-solving workshop (world-cafÃ© style). Participants will be invited to provide specific purchasing challenges from their institutions, and then work with members of their table group to develop solutions.

1909,California State University Says Goodbye to Single-Use Plastics,"The California State University includes 23 campuses, 500,000 students and sustains more than 150,000 employees. A new system policy enacted in December establishes purchasing practices aimed at eliminating disposable plastic items which make up a significant proportion of the waste campuses send to landfills-while giving preference to reusable, compostable or recyclable products instead. According to the policy, all CSU campuses must eliminate plastic straws and carryout bags beginning in 2019. In addition, campuses must phase out Styrofoam food service items by January 2021 and discontinue sales and distribution of single-use plastic water bottles before January 2023. The plan expands upon the Board of Trustees' Policy on Sustainability by making sustainability central to the CSU's business processes.

2304,Leveraging Campus Buying Power to Get Toxic Chemicals Out of Our Food and Off School Grounds,"This session aims to educate, inspire, and equip purchasing decision makers, relevant staff and students to take action, collaborate with other purchasers, and employ creative solutions to eliminate toxic chemicals on university campuses. Numerous products and services use toxic chemicals that pose risks to students, faculty, staff and the broader community. Environmentally preferable purchasing plays a critical role in creating healthier campuses and contributing to a more sustainable economy. How can universities make these important decisions particularly when it comes to the widespread use of hormone disrupting chemicals, carcinogens, and other toxic chemicals in everyday products and practices? Participants will learn about the unique concerns posed by hormone disruptors and they will gain tools and resources to get these chemicals of concern off campuses - walking through examples in foodware, school grounds and food. 'Non-stick' fluorinated chemicals in the same family as Teflon and Scotchgard (PFAS) are gaining notoriety as hundreds of communities across the US are finding these extremely persistent chemicals in their water. PFAS have been linked to kidney and testicular cancer, immune system damage, infertility and thyroid disease. PFAS are widely used in some single-use foodware, where they can migrate out of products into food and stay in our bodies for many years. Many of the herbicides sprayed on UC campuses contain glyphosate, the active ingredient in the most widely used herbicide, Roundup. In the recent historic court case, Johnson V Monsanto, the jury awarded millions in damages to a school groundskeeper who developed cancer after ongoing use of the controversial chemical. Herbicide-Free UC will share their successful experience with UC Berkeley. Unfortunately, glyphosate is also used on food crops and concerning levels have been found in popular cereals such as Cheerios and Quaker Oats, as it is sprayed on oats right before harvest.",Center for Environmental Health,8979,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,Purchasing,Grounds,Wellbeing & Work,,,,"chemicals,green purchasing,purchasing power,environmental health,pesticides,herbicides",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Sue Chiang,Pollution Prevention Director,Center for Environmental Health,8979,Mackenzie Feldman,Founder,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Chiang_1788.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17334/1530_Chiang_1788.pdf,,,,,,
2495,Breaking the Cycle of Convenience Culture: Inspiring Accountability Through Ownership,"College and university campuses are not closed systems. The population changes day to day, depending on class, staff, and vendor schedules and activities. With an ever-changing population with diverse needs and challenges, how do you shift from a culture of single-use to reuse? Many solutions have been proposed to solve the problem of single-use cups - compostables, reusables, shared ownership programs. How do these solutions preserve or abolish the status quo? How can we successfully implement reuse programs to drive long-term sustainability? In this session, KeepCup will explore strategies to break the cycle of convenience culture and move away from the 'take-make-waste' model. KeepCup will discuss best practice and explore how ownership inspires accountability and how, through individual and collective action, student, staff and vendors can help lead the cultural shift away from single-use.",KeepCup,8738,,,,,,,,,,,Purchasing,Waste,,,,,"reuse,single-use plastic,waste reduction,consumption",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Jamila Williams,Business Development Manager,KeepCup,8738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Williams_1878.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18216/1400_Williams_1878.pptx,,,,,,
2492,Beyond Green - Can Your IT Purchasing Also Drive Supply Chain Responsibility?,"IT hardware is a complex category for institutional purchasers. Institutions are concerned about not only environmental impacts of their IT infrastructure, but also working conditions in the manufacturing supply chains behind the computers and other devices they purchase. Institutional purchasing is a powerful influencer of IT industry progress. When multiple purchasers stand behind the same sustainability criteria, the industry can respond more effectively. As an independent certification, with criteria and verification of both environmental and supply chain responsibility, we wanted to investigate the influence on IT factory working conditions, when purchasers use TCO Certified in their IT purchasing contracts. The study assessed Code of Conduct compliance in a final assembly factory, manufacturing computers for six global IT brands. Over 2.5 years, a series of independent social audits in the factory was carried out to assess initial status and monitor progress of corrective actions. Through independent verification, we concluded that when the supplier factory is left to correct audit findings themselves, there is relatively little improvement. In a third audit, led by the IT brand customer, there was measurable improvement, but still remaining non-conformities at the 'major' level. It was only when when multiple brand customers brought with them the leverage of purchasers wanting TCO Certified products, that the certification's built-in system of accountability and independent monitoring drove significantly improved closure results in areas like worker health and safety, labor rights and working hours. The case study concluded that purchaser use of TCO Certified in purchasing criteria has a direct impact on IT supply chain responsibility, as the system holds brands and their suppliers directly accountable through continued monitoring of code compliance.",TCO Certified,9532,,,,,,,,,,,Purchasing,,,,,,"supply chains,information technology,third party certifications,purchasing power",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Clare Hobby,"Director, Purchaser Engagement Global",TCO Certified,9532,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Hobby_1904.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18202/1530_Hobby_1904.pdf,,,,,,
1910,Sustainable Procurement in Laboratories: It's Time to Act,"Recent years have seen an increased focus on sustainable procurement across a multitude of industries. Yet with little information or sustainability standards for laboratory products, it has been challenging for procurement specialists and scientists alike to consider greener products in the lab. This is starting to change due to the recent development of an eco-nutrition label - ACT - by the non-profit My Green Lab. ACT stands for accountability, consistency, and transparency. It is also imperative, as research labs continue to be some of the largest consumers of energy and water, and the largest producers of waste, at research universities. By providing much-needed information on the environmental impact of manufacturing, using, and disposing of laboratory products, the ACT label enables organizations to meet research goals while also assisting with satisfying broader institutional goals around carbon neutrality and zero waste. By the end of 2019, there will be over 200 laboratory products with the ACT label. These products include equipment, chemicals, and consumables. As the product list grows, organizations are increasingly able to request this information from their suppliers and to empower their scientists to make smarter, more sustainable purchasing decisions. This presentation will discuss the details of the ACT label program and will provide concrete steps for how we can work together to promote transparency and integrate sustainability into the procurement of scientific products.",My Green Lab,7705,,,,,,,,,,,Purchasing,,,,,,"procurement,green purchasing,green labs",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Allison Paradise,CEO,My Green Lab,7705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1927,Improving Sustainable Purchasing Through Business Services Systems and Practices,"The purchase of supplies by staff in universities is connected to the use of energy, water, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste. The types and quantities of supplies purchased in universities can be influenced by business administrative processes. Universities can strategically establish or modify business service systems and practices to make it easier for staff to reduce the quantity of supplies purchased or transition to more environmentally-friendly supplies. This presentation will summarize several recent initiatives at Stanford University to improve the sustainability in its purchasing through business system and process changes. Examples of these initiatives include: reducing printing by establishing consistency in how software is used to ease online file-sharing; reducing the need for printing and the purchase of single supplies by encouraging and providing resources for remote-collaboration; and transitioning to more environmentally-friendly supplies by providing staff with departmentally-specific user-friendly environmental supply lists. Specifically, the presentation will include details of the internal research done by Stanford's Sustainability Staff about the cost impacts of transitioning to environmentally-friendly supplies, as well as lessons-learned to help others ease the change management related to these transitions.

The role of actors as drivers, participants, and resistors of sustainability will be presented, with examples of key areas in which actors are influencing sustainability uptake. The extent to which historically marginalized groups are involved in SHE will be presented, including on the basis of gender, race, and other forms of diversity. We found evidence of three types of policy-practice relationships: high policy-high practice, low policy-high practice, and low policy-low practice. At some institutions, policy and practice were largely aligned, while at others, participants' perceived a greater focus on one or the other. Additionally, we found institutional specific characteristics that influenced these relationships, such as size of institution, local culture, and campus sustainability actors. SEPN's research provides information on patterns and trends in factors influencing educational policy development to inform global environmental and sustainability education policy initiatives and future monitoring efforts. The presentation will end with considerations for students, community members, and professionals, including policy decision-makers, administrators, faculty, sustainability staff, and education policy researchers, seeking to advance sustainability at their institution.

1891,"The Best Worst Way to Pick a Sustainability Culture Instrument, and How to do Better Next Time","Sustainability culture can't be measured using using meters or gauges, so community members and researchers need a different kind of instrument. The go-to instruments are surveys to support a better understanding of sustainability-related constructs, but the quality of the data collected through these instruments is limited by the instrument design and implementation. This presentation introduces the important concerns of instrument reliability and validity, which must go hand in hand during instrument selection and development, so that investigators can appropriately answer their research questions. It takes examples from the process used in fall 2018 - spring 2019 to identify a sustainability culture instrument for use at the University of Northern Colorado to explain where good intentions fall short and how to do better. By incorporating the knowledge and experience of other disciplines like psychology and statistics, the audience will learn how relatively minor changes in identifying and implementing a sustainability culture instrument can lead to more robust and defensible conclusions.

2440,"Native Bee Conservation: Bridging the Gap Between Research, Sustainability, and Educating the Public","Approximately 85% of flowering plants depend on animals for pollination. Bees, one of the most important pollinator groups, not only enable reproduction of most wild flowering plants, but also play an important economic role as they lend pollinator services to approximately 75% of crops. Although the honey bee has been widely used for crop pollination, recent reports of unusually high rates of loss of managed colonies have highlighted that has become unsustainable to rely on a single species for their pollinator services. Also, native bees have been shown to provide better quality pollination. Their presence enhances cross pollination and fruit set in a wide variety of crop species. This suggests that conservation strategies focused on increasing wild bee diversity have the potential to improved yield in animal pollinated crops. Central College is a liberal arts institution. Part of a liberal arts education is to connect different disciplines. Our undergraduate research program on native bees encourages students to not only study the biology of bees but to apply this knowledge to inspire communities to use sustainable practices that will lead to the conservation of native bees. The Iowa based research seeks to determine which native prairie plant species attracts the higher number and diversity of bees. The goal is to educate farmers on which prairie species to plant in their un-farmable land to increase pollinator services for their crops, while also conserving native bees. Our Costa Rica based research seeks to provide information useful to stingless beekeepers. Stingless bees are native to Costa Rica and keeping these bees provides communities with income, while helping preserve the bees and their ecosystem, in addition to crop pollination. Finally, Central College is a certified Bee Campus and therefore, we have developed programs to educate diverse audiences on the importance of native bee conservation.",Central College,4371,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Public Engagement,,,,,"bees,biodiversity,Bee Campus USA,pollinators",10/29/2019,AASHE,Poster,Elizabeth Sheldon,Student,Central College,4371,Paulina Mena,Associate Professor,Central College,4371,Alexis Engen,Student,Central College,4371,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Mena_1861.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17931/1100_Mena_1861.pdf,,,,,,
1961,Questions that Need Answers: Resolving Data Gaps as an Opportunity for Communities and Universities,"As research deepens around the sustainable economy, theoretical and analytical gaps in knowledge are becoming clearer. Universities can use this information, and their position as interdisciplinary institutions, to direct their research toward filling the data gaps most critical to their communities. SDSN USA produces two indices assessing progress toward the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030 at the city and state level in the US. In the process, data availability and gaps were identified. Through the presentation of these gaps, SDSN USA will 1.) Highlight specific areas where university research could have the greatest impact on addressing SDG data limitations 2.) Present case studies of how universities have developed programming, centers, and outreach that leveraged their expertise to fill these gaps. Universities that have taken these questions on have been able to provide value to their communities, raise their profiles, and strengthen partnerships with communities and governments.

2501,Green Behaviors and Preferences Among College Students,"Our article contributes to the literature by investigating college students' environmental preferences and behavior by investigating their recycling attitudes and frequencies, their preference between tap versus bottled water, their willingness to deny a single-use plastic straw, and their choice of printing settings at the campus library. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the denial of single-use plastic straws as a green behavior. We specifically study how demographic and college-related characteristics influence environmental attitudes and affect the likelihood of these pro-environmental actions. In other words, our study aims to inspect recycling attitudes and green behaviors among college students while controlling for clearly defined external variables, holding all other variables constant. Our study builds upon existing literature that focuses on recycling and green behavior among college students using multiple regression analysis (Meyer, 2016). Through our research, we hope to provide insights for the design and promotion of economic incentives and behavioral nudges that will decrease campus pollution and therefore improve sustainability on campus. Sharing our research with faculty, students, and staff has sparked discussion among campus administrators and student-based clubs. From these discussions, two specific policy changes have been implemented at the college. First, the default printing setting at the campus library was switched from single-sided to double-sided printing which will decrease the amount of paper printing every day at the library. Second, the food dining services on campus are moving toward only offering biodegradable straws in the dining halls.",Manhattan College,3261,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,"student attitudes,behavior change,campus culture,single-use plastic",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Jimena Gonzalez-Ramirez,Assistant Professor,Manhattan College,3261,Veronica Cheng,Undergraduate Student,Manhattan College,3261,Sierra Arral,Student,Manhattan College,3261,Heyi Cheng,Undergraduate Student,Manhattan College,3261,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_GonzalezRamirez_1531.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18242/1445_GonzalezRamirez_1531.pdf,,,,,,
2383,"Using Sustainability Principles to Impact Library Education: Information Literacy, Resources and Services","Libraries are the ultimate hubs of sustainability on academic campuses. Libraries are built for everyone, provide services to everyone, and seek to house information - physically and digitally - on every topic. Recently, the American Library Association (ALA) voted to include Sustainability as a core value of Librarianship. This inclusion serves to further the ALA Library Code of Ethics to include making strategic decisions that will affect future generations of library users. Research has long been heralded as a cyclical, instead of linear, process. Borrowing from systems thinking to help explain concepts related to information literacy serves two purposes: To better enable learners to grasp the various factors that impact the research process; and to offer an opportunity to infuse all learning with systems thinking to promote a more mindful, holistic perception of the world.

2047,Getting There from Here: Improving Data Collection and Reporting Related to Commuting Impacts,"For more than a decade, tracking greenhouse gas emissions and other impacts of commuting has been one of the more crazy-making aspects of sustainability reporting and planning. In 2019, University of New Hampshire and Second Nature convened a Working Group of leaders in sustainability tracking and reporting with the overarching goal to identify the most efficacious way to gather, track, and calculate information on the current state of commuting for the institution. This panel discussion will focus on the findings and recommendations of the Working Group, opportunities to implement those findings (for calculation and reporting tools like SIMAP and AASHE, and for individual campuses), and any progress made toward such implementation. The findings focus on four primary objectives: 1) data alignment between platforms, in order to minimize the need to parse data multiple ways for multiple platforms and to have a body of metrics that are coherent and consistent 2) standardization of data collection methods and instruments, whether survey or more objective data sources, in order to reduce the need for every campus to develop its own methodology from scratch 3) updates to the methodology in SIMAP (and potentially other tools) for customizing emissions factors and fuel efficiencies, and incorporating electric vehicles effectively and clearly in the GHG inventory 4) identification of other long-term opportunities for improvement, research needs, etc. For each objective, presenters will discuss the findings and recommendations as they relate to the presenters' campuses and those of the other Working Group members.

2542,Revolutionizing Transportation & Mobility Data Surveys with AI and Smart Phones: A pilot study,"Data science, artificial intelligence and smart phones carry the potential to revolutionize transportation/mobility planning and scope 3 greenhouse house gas inventories. Traditional transportation surveys are conducted by hundreds of AASHE-member campuses to meet reporting requirements for both campus-wide greenhouse emissions calculations, and for building-level LEED certification. Data collection and analysis can be time consuming. Ultimately data from traditional transportation surveys carries several uncertainties and restrictions that limit deep insights and further planning. In traditional surveys, data is typically self-reported, rather than capturing real mobility behavior across space and time. The geospatial information resulting from traditional surveys may be limited to total distance travel, or origin and destination at best, but typically contains no information about travel path or aggregated travel density. Detailed temporal information (time of day) is also often omitted. Here we present the results from a pilot study conducted at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, in Syracuse NY, in the Spring of 2019, and using new technology developed by B-Line Analytics. B-Line Analytics uses mobile phone GPS, an App-based interface to track user mobility in space and time with high resolution. Artificial intelligence algorithms are used to classify modes of transportation of users. Data is then aggregated to show spatial 'heat map' patterns of travel for an entire organization, as well as total greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, the user interface on the B-Line smart phone App also allows for increased user engagement and education. The study was conducted in the context of LEED Existing Building Certification. Further campus-wide uses, including for campus-wide GHG emission and for research in environmental health and pollution exposures are also discussed.",State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry,1404,B-Line Analytics,8650,,,,,,,,,Transportation,Air & Climate,Coordination & Planning,,,,"commuting,surveys,information technology,GIS",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Alex Poisson,PhD Candidate and Sustainability Staff,State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry,1404,Aaron Short,CEO,B-Line Analytics,8650,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Poisson_1668.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18434/0915_Poisson_1668.pptx,,,,,,

2119,"How Providing Public Transit Passes Not Only Helps Students Financially, But Empowers Them Too","Environmental Action Committee (EAC) is a student led campus organization working on sustainable initiatives that benefit both the campus and student body at Augsburg University. One of the group's main goals since its creation has been to make public transportation more accessible to students, hoping this would help reduce emissions harmful to the environment while addressing financial accessibility inequities. With Augsburg University being in the heart of Minneapolis, EAC came together with the school's administration and the Twin Cities' public transportation operator, Metro Transit, to create a 3-year, pilot program, providing each day-student with a Metro Pass that would cover their fares. Augsburg University was one of the first higher education institutions in Minnesota to offer a program like this to its student body. EAC provided insight from the students through surveying and found that many struggled to pay for transit fares, even if it is their primary form of travel. Concluding that free Metro Pass availability would provide equal transportation opportunity, the program could additionally be used for more curricular and professional engagement throughout the Twin Cities, empowering students. EAC and Augsburg University went forward to approve a budget and will launch what has become known as the Metro Transit Auggie Pass Program in the fall semester of 2019.",Augsburg University,1933,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation,Campus Engagement,,,,,"u-pass,public transit",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Skye Rygh,Student,Augsburg University,1933,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1928,Safer Streets: Applying the Volpe National Side Guard Standard for Large Trucks on a Campus,"In February 2018, Harvard University announced a new initiative to improve pedestrian and cyclist safety by becoming the first higher education institution on the East Coast to install side guards on its large trucks. The truck-safety initiative applies not only to vehicles owned by the University, but extends to trucks operated by major vendors as well. Led by the Office for Sustainability, representatives from a variety of Harvard departments, including Strategic Procurement, Fleet Management, and Environmental Health & Safety, partnering with the U.S. Department of Transportation Volpe Center (Volpe), worked over a year to develop a leading truck-safety program aligned with the Volpe Side Guard Standard. It includes two major components: (1) After a successful pilot installing the side guards on Mail & Delivery Services box trucks, Harvard fleet technicians installed side guards on all existing, eligible Harvard-owned trucks, including box trucks and solid waste and recycling trucks. When appropriate, new trucks purchased by Harvard will include side guards. (2) Harvard has also begun asking vendors that drive large trucks to campus to install side guards on eligible trucks as quickly as possible. In response, the University's waste-management vendors, Republic Services and Save That Stuff, have installed side guards on all waste-service trucks serving Harvard's campus. Moving forward, contracts for preferred vendors that bring eligible trucks onto campus will include a requirement to develop and share a plan for meeting the Volpe Side Guard Standard. This session will share lessons learned and will give tools to the audience for implanting a program like this at their school and/or community.",Harvard University,4451,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation,Coordination & Planning,Wellbeing & Work,,,,"safety,pedestrians,bikes,fleet management",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,David Havelick,Sustainability Staff,Harvard University,4451,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Havelick_1484.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16208/1400_Havelick_1484.pptx,,,,,,
1982,Charging Ahead: Plan and Collaborate to Support Electric Vehicle Adoption by Commuters and Fleets,"Vehicle electrification is creating new demands on universities to provide electrical charging stations for commuters, visitors, and campus-owned vehicles. Rapidly increasing demand for these services is evidenced by the exponential sales growth of plug-in electric vehicles, along with the increasing number and types of electric vehicles available to consumers and fleet managers. However, while vehicle electrification offers promise of greenhouse gas emissions reductions, campuses also face many potential barriers in supporting commuter and fleet electrification, including limited capacity on the campus electrical grid; existing parking policies and revenue collection; purchasing of vehicles and charging infrastructure; financing priorities; safety concerns; air emissions reduction questions; and accessibility (e.g. ADA) requirements. A geographically diverse panel of three university sustainability officers will discuss lessons learned from early attempts to provide electric vehicle charging on their campuses -- and how they are working with on- and off-campus allies to plan for future installations. Panelists will emphasize how to create relationships and processes that can scale up to meet growing demands for electric vehicle charging along with emerging opportunities for electrification of campus vehicles.","University of North Carolina, Charlotte",0725,University of Pittsburgh,0760,University of Florida,2088,,,,,,,Transportation,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"electric vehicles,charging stations,electrification",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Michael Lizotte,University Sustainability Officer,"University of North Carolina, Charlotte",0725,Aurora Sharrard,Director of Sustainability,University of Pittsburgh,0760,Matthew Williams,"Director, Office of Sustainability",University of Florida,2088,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1100_Sharrard_1246.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16349/1100_Sharrard_1246.pdf,,,,,,
2114,Benefits of Technology Platforms for Improving Alternative Transit Modeshare,"Biking is one of the most efficient, environmentally-friendly, and economically sustainable ways to travel in an urban environment. Not only does it have huge financial and environmental benefits by eliminating a need for gas, but it also has numerous health benefits. Biking has therefore become an increasingly popular transportation method, and in turn, Dockless Bikeshare programs have enjoyed a ferocious popularity. During this period and through taking advantage of this trend, the University of Denver was able to capture really excellent data that helps us understand the impacts and benefits of utilizing new technology platforms. The technological developments that are encompassing the modern era have the capabilities to not only provide us with data about alternate transit preferences and habits, but can help us shape our communities into a more sustainable model. The University of Denver utilized a dockless bike share program (ofo) for a period of five months. By analyzing the data collected over these months (ride length, ride frequencies, GPS data, monthly trends, and new rider rates) and comparing it to the long-term trends of DU's bike shop activity, campus bike audits and transportation surveys, we can better understand the effect that ofo had on DU's modeshare. This case study will discuss the relationship between bike share programs and general campus biking trends, and how we can use this data to carve our college campuses into more bike-friendly and sustainable areas. Participants will leave the sessions with an understanding of how other universities and student groups can more effectively take advantage of technological resources in an economically advantageous way to get communities more inspired to use alternate ways of transportation.",University of Denver,2186,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation,Research,,,Transportation & Parking,,"bike share,bikes,alternative transportation,information technology",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Laura Braun,Undergraduate Student,University of Denver,2186,Max Michalec,Undergraduate Student,University of Denver,2186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1415_Braun_1395.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16840/1415_Braun_1395.pptx,,,,,,
2298,Employer-Provided Mobility: Energy Efficient Commuting to Empower Early Career Workers,"Higher education prepares students to succeed in their careers. This should include the knowledge that those entering the job market have substantial power toward co-creation of sustainable economic practices. One powerful lever is choosing an employer who supports energy efficient commuting options as offered through employer-provided mobility (EPM) benefits. EPM is any employment-based benefit designed to enhance mobility for employees, provided in a manner similar to employer-provided health or retirement benefits. EPM benefits vary, and may include transit pass subsidies, micro-mobility options, coordinated shared commuting services, or advanced door-to-door shuttle services. In the present competitive job market, employers seek to attract and retain the most talented employees. With many potential employees of younger generations who are less inclined to want to own or drive a car, a benefit to support an employee's commute to work is a strong reason to choose one employer over another. Via EPM options, both employer and employee may benefit by reclaiming commuting costs in time and money, shifting unproductive time spent driving a car to productive time, while reducing the stress of commuting. EPM has emerged as popular and growing in high-tech areas of dense employment on the West Coast, but is appearing in much less dense cities, such as Buffalo, Columbus, and Denver. Municipalities increasingly look to employers to mitigate the impact of commuters at peak congestion, further motivated by limited funding and geographic impracticality to build more infrastructure. Young workers are empowered to co-create a new commuting paradigm by demanding employers provide better, more efficient commuting options. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is developing approaches and tools to understand the potential of EPM to reduce energy use and optimize commuting experiences.",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,7506,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation,Wellbeing & Work,Public Engagement,,,,"employers,sustainable transportation,workforce development,commuting,employee benefits",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Andrew Duvall,Transportation Behavior Analyst,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,7506,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2057,Financially Justifying Sustainable Transportation Changes Through Right-Sizing the Fleet,"The campus fleet is one of the most visible areas a university can make improvements to its sustainability. However, the vehicles have a job to do, so the solution needs to work. Also, fleet spending is being cut across the country, so the solution needs to be financially justifiable, or pay for itself. The University of California San Diego, the University of Texas Austin and the University of North Carolina have all made great progress in this area and would like to share how they did it. This is to be a panel discussion with Chris Facente, Fleet and Automotive Supervisor at UNCC, Jim Walker, Director of Sustainability UT Austin, Gregory Nishihira, the Assistant Director of Fleet at UCSD and Russ Ziegler, the College and University Specialist for Polaris GEM. Chris, Jim and Greg have all spearheaded projects at their universities to make sustainable changes. They have done this by right-sizing their fleets. They are going to discuss where they started, the challenges they encountered and help lay out a path forward for universities hoping to make a change. One main topic of discussion will be utilizing electric Low Speed Vehicles (LSV's) in place of traditional internal combustion over-the-road vehicles. This change allows for a reduction in CO2 emissions as well as substantial cost savings, both in acquisition and operating cost all while still being able to do the job required of the campus fleet.

1977,Dynamics of Campus Interconnectivity: The Mobility-Energy-Productivity Metric,"Campuses are microcosms of emerging mobility advancement to connect people with opportunities, employment, goods, and services, and where modes such as bike and car shares, electric scooters, ride-sourcing, and ride-sharing are rapidly proliferating. Recognizing that future mobility will no longer be dominated by individually owned vehicles, but rather a rich mixture of various modes, the Department of Energy has struggled to transition from miles per gallon to mobility per gallon. Existing transportation analytics poorly reflect emerging mobility dynamics of parking, convenience, access, sustainability, and quality of life. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory created the Mobility Energy Productivity (MEP) metric as a new paradigm for evaluating mobility options that take into account the ability to reach education or job opportunities, goods, and services based on travel time, cost and energy. MEP scores can enable individuals or institution to readily assess mobility options. This facilitates co-creation of sustainable economic outcomes by improving equity of access by various demographic groups and identifies where improvements can be made to make energy-efficient modes more safe and appealing. MEP is multi-modal in scope, measuring the relative efficiency of accessing a variety of opportunities with respect to travel time, cost and energy, and can be computed from readily available data sources. The MEP metric can be used to reflect the impact of new modes and technologies, understand the variety of shopping or food outlets at a location, inform either residential or business relocation, ultimately guiding us to a more sustainable, holistic urban mobility systems. With the American Society for Civil Engineers (ASCE), the MEP is moving forward as a foundational provisional standard metric for Smart City assessment. As students venture into the workforce, it may soon be common to ask an employer, 'By the way, what is the company MEP score?'",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,7506,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"transportation mobility,metrics",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Andrew Duvall,Transportation Behavior Analyst,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,7506,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After six months, the provider pulled the bikes off campus. Later that year our university signed a MOU with another provider. This time we developed a plan for the launch of the program and it is operating successfully. We have also had to deal with the city prior to the initial launch of the bike share program since they had signed a contract with another provider 18 months prior to our MOU with the first provider. Even though the city program was not operating, we had to follow restrictions of the use of our bikes on the city's right-of-ways. After the launch of our second bike share program, the city signed a contract with a scooter provider. Eight months prior to the scooters arriving in the city our campus administration created a policy prohibiting scooters on the campus. However, the scooters soon were showing up on our campus.

2251,A Shareable Economy and the Use of Ride Shares,"A 'shareable economy' is where profit is still made, but the environmental impacts are mitigated or reduced. This type relies on the temporary ownership of goods and/or the purchase of services that replace the need for ownership. Through this model, consumers are buying the opportunity to 'share' something that someone already owns. This reduces the need to purchase and build more products/buildings as the needed items/amenities are more or less rented. We propose an idea that would allow the university to partner with a business that would create a more economically and environmentally sustainable university by partaking in the sharing economy. The proposal is inspired by Vanderbilt University's Commodore Card that students can use to pay for rides on the Lyft app. This ensures that students have a safe and reliable way to get around, as well as reducing the need for single person auto usage, but doesn't put a dent into Vanderbilt's budget. We propose that the University of Louisville partners with local rideshare companies to provide a significantly lower ride price for students. This would require the university to pay the rideshare company for a code (or alternative method) that students can input for a discounted price. A system like this would be useful because it could potentially reduce the amount of people using personal cars, as this cheap and convenient alternative transportation can eliminate the need for students to bring/buy cars while living on campus (less space for parking lots equals more potential green space) while also increasing the need for jobs which benefit local community car and business owners. This proposal incorporates all three branches of sustainability by benefiting the social need for safe rides, economic gains from community drivers, and environmental gains through the decreased demand for parking lots and car ownership while living on or close to campus.",University of Louisville,1647,,,,,,,,,,,Transportation,Campus Engagement,,,,,"safety,ridesharing",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Razija Mehinovic,Zero Waste Intern,University of Louisville,1647,Samantha Hudson,Digital Communication Intern,University of Louisville,1647,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2192,Beyond Diversion: The New Zero Waste Roadmap Strategy - PLAN's Atlas Project,"While diversion has been the go-to metric for evaluating our waste reduction efforts, it skips over several levels of the waste reduction hierarchy, resulting in the prioritization of recycling and composting rates over source reduction and aversion. During this session, we will hear from campuses who worked with PLAN to Pilot a new framework that informed the creation of a holistic, feasible plan to reduce campus waste production. We call this the Zero Waste Atlas Project. We will discuss the types of qualitative data integral to understanding campus waste management operations, in addition to quantitative metrics that go beyond diversion. This interactive session will walk you through the steps to creating a Roadmap to Zero Waste specific to your campus. We'll address the key pieces involved in developing a plan including materials management infrastructure, stakeholder input, identifying existing initiatives and determining opportunities for improvement. Attendees will use a sample Atlas tool to conduct a brief initial assessment of their campus programs, and then work with presenters to create a list of recommendations that they can begin to utilize in developing a campus-wide Zero Waste Plan.

1881,E-Waste: A Catalyst for Campus Innovation and Collaboration,"Electronic waste is increasingly recognized as the fastest growing component of our waste stream and presents a global challenge that will continue to grow as technology advances. So, how do and how should universities manage this quickly growing waste stream? What department manages your e-waste and what collaborative efforts could help close the loop for electronic repurposing and responsible recycling? University efforts to manage e-waste do not readily follow a template and management strategies can vary widely and be influenced by the campus departments where they reside. This session profiles the efforts of two university campuses grappling with these questions while seeking to turn institutional challenges into opportunities for electronics repurposing and e-waste management. Jonathan Latko, Director of Temple University's award-winning Computer Recycling Center (CRC) will provide an overview of how he has been able to create a widely successfully model for electronics management and surplus sales. The CRC is revenue positive and a valuable resource for the university and the community. Eva Rocke and Derek Kanwischer from the University of Montana will provide an overview of their effort to build a responsive and responsible program in the rural state of Montana. While still a budding program, UM's efforts have been informed by work done at Temple and other universities across the country. This case study will provide details of the process to overcome institutional hurdles through building campus partnerships.

2272,Good as New: A Discussion on Reducing Waste While Increasing Equity,"For the past three years, the Tishman Environment and Design Center at The New School has coordinated and executed a free sale event for students called 'Good as New' in an effort to reduce waste and serve critical student needs. The 'Good as New' program is designed so that students across the campus are asked to donate unneeded school supplies and materials at the end of the school year. These materials are collected in central locations and then sorted. At the start of the Fall semester, when incoming students are beginning their courses, we host a 'Free Sale' event where these items are displayed for students to select. This has been a great way to help offset the waste that students leave in their lockers at the end of the year and to provide perfectly good (and often costly) materials for students that may have trouble affording them. We believe that this is a good model, particularly for dense urban campuses with limited space and design schools with high cost, specialized school supplies required for courses. Through the 'Good As New' program, we've diverted over a ton of waste each year while providing valuable resources to students in need. We propose to share this model program with other institutions of higher education and also receive feedback and ideas for further developing our program.",The New School,2334,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,,,,"waste diversion,resale,free stores,move-in,move-out,reuse",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Mike Harrington,Assistant Director,The New School,2334,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Harrington_1529.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17246/1530_Harrington_1529.pdf,,,,,,

These include a permanent Free Store, a yearly Move-Out Program, and most recently, a Spring Cleaning Yard Sale. Future goals include a permanent repair shop and repair workshop events. Additionally, the Free Store has worked with a number of campus groups to create staff and event t-shirts on the unprinted sides of donated shirts. These initiatives are visual and interactive, allowing students to see their environmental impact and benefit directly from it. Through community connections, items from the 2018 Move-Out reached 1500 local families in need. Students are engaged in a small-scale sharing economy every time they donate and shop at the Free Store. This session will focus on the structure of these programs and how they are maintained by students.

Still, much work remains. In this session, staff and faculty members from TRU and UW-Madison will share two initiatives that seek to influence consumer recycling behavior by using Community Based Social Marketing (CBSM), qualitative and quantitative social science research, and social prompts. Audience members will learn about the background and motivation behind these initiatives; the processes of research, analysis, and implementation of the two behavior change campaigns; the role of cross-campus partnerships and student engagement; and the current status of the initiatives, including future trajectories. There will then be a Q&A period where audience members will be invited to share their own stories about recycling communications campaigns and brainstorm future projects and research.

2442,"A Solar-Powered Automatic Composter: Students Combine Engineering, Science and Community Engagement","The University of Houston-Downtown's Center for Urban Agriculture and Sustainability (CUAS) has a number of student initiatives focused at creating future sustainability leaders. One area of focus is to foster collaboration within a group of students in order to address a community need. The CUAS experiential summer program is one such program. This year one group of students created a solar-powered automatic composter that rotates daily on a timer. The team that created the composter includes students of biology, engineering and technology and one in business. Their goal was to make composting easier for the average busy Houstonian. If the composter were to mix automatically then it would not matter if the composting household forgot to mix their compost for long periods of time. The solar-powered automatic composter is also a renewable energy solution for solving the problem. This is not only good for reducing the carbon footprint, but gives the system the flexibility of being placed far from standard power access. In addition to building this system, the students are analyzing the composting process and determining the community impact of their design. A batch of compost was split between the automatic composter and a standard composter which is mixed manually every few days. Weekly samples have been collected all summer to determine differences in nitrogen accumulation and microbial density between the two systems. The automated system was demonstrated to local non-profits and community garden organizers and during the Houston Food Conference held at UHD in June of 2019. The students have also created a survey to evaluate the hurdles to composting within the general community and to determine how this system may overcome such hurdles.

2276,"Waste Not, Want Not: How Campus Waste Reduction Becomes Part of the Circular Economy","Rising carbon emissions and the increasing visibility of waste from our linear system of production and consumption have precipitated urgent conversations about how to grow an effective circular economy. Aimed at 'optimizing the use of resources and reducing or eliminating waste' a circular economy provides one way to move past the environmental degradation associated with linear models of resource use. The University of Washington Tacoma (UWT), a largely non-residential campus serving primarily non-traditional students, has begun to implement efforts to reduce waste and costs on campus. These projects are often not funded by state dollars, and therefore sustainability must pay for itself in some way. This presentation describes in detail self-funded sustainability successes at UWT to date and then looks to the future with an online campus waste survey administered to students, staff, and faculty at UWT. In the survey, members of the campus community were asked open-ended questions regarding where they saw opportunities for waste reduction and increased energy efficiency. The results from the survey were coded to identify certain practices (e.g. landfill reduction, energy and water conservation, and composting) and events (e.g. student orientation and graduation). After identifying ways to reduce waste and increase efficiency, student and faculty researchers worked with campus administration and Facilities & Services with an eye towards what is often referred to as the 'triple bottom line' - ensuring that social, environmental, and financial benefit are achieved in tandem. In doing so, this campus case study addresses the benefits of working within a circular economy and the new 'sustainability paradigm.' This presentation will make available to participants both the survey questions and research structure, enabling other campuses to use this methodology to similarly identify areas for waste reduction and greater efficiency.","University of Washington, Tacoma",7862,"University of Washington, Seattle",4030,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,"circular economy,waste reduction,surveys,energy efficiency,triple bottom line",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Ellen Moore,Senior Lecturer,"University of Washington, Tacoma",7862,James Gawel,Associate Professor,"University of Washington, Tacoma",7862,Kaitlyn Conway,Sustainability Staff,"University of Washington, Tacoma",7862,Kaitlyn Crudge,Student,"University of Washington, Seattle",4030,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Moore_1562.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17256/1530_Moore_1562.pdf,,,,,,
2289,The Compost Stewards Program: A Case Study in Campus Composting,"This informational session will describe the Compost Stewards Program operated by the Office of Sustainability at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This program originated from a proposal to our campus Green Fund by an individual seeking to start composting office waste. This led to the purchase of thirty durable five-gallon bins for office compost collection. The development of the project was tasked to the Office of Sustainability because it had ready-made connections to campus offices, thus providing an ideal platform from which to launch a pilot program. Today, the Office of Sustainability distributes compost bins and provides instructions about proper compost collection. Participating offices independently dispose of their own compost at a designated campus drop-off location. UW-Madison compost is processed at a local biodigestion facility. In addition to producing compost, this facility also captures and sells the biogas byproduct to power local residences and businesses, helping boost the expanding market for renewable energy. The Compost Stewards Program has been an immediate, though modest success. All thirty of the original bins now are distributed to eight different campus offices. This is by design: the program aimed to start small, highlighting the feasibility of expanding compost without overwhelming the current system. This program also highlights an overarching goal of the Office of Sustainability: connecting everyday behaviors to larger, system-level sustainability efforts. The Compost Stewards Program emphasizes proper education of its participants, a deliberately small-scale pilot, and the key component of each office being responsible for its own compost collection. Presenters will offer guidelines for proper composting and the in-office protocol followed by participating campus offices that can help participants conceptualize composting at their institutions.

We start with a short presentation on the global impacts of waste and consumption and provide examples of tangible solutions to each of these dilemmas. The main focus of the workshop will be on empowering attendees to take action on their campuses. We will draw on our national experience with campuses from across the country to highlight innovative ideas for how students can view waste as a resource through which they can generate revenue, save money for students and campus departments, and benefit the environment. Examples include, but are not limited to: move out collection and resale programs, tool and bike shares, repair cafes, clothing swaps, campus thrift stores and more. We end with an exercise on power-mapping campus departments and a discussion on how students can take steps to implement change on their campuses: who to talk to, how to conduct those types of conversations, and where to turn when they face hurdles and challenges along the way.",Post-Landfill Action Network,6582,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,"zero waste,student engagement,waste reduction",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Kayla Conway,Atlas Zero Waste Strategist,Post-Landfill Action Network,6582,Alex Freid,Founder and Co-Director,Post-Landfill Action Network,6582,Yu-Shien Ni,Atlas Zero Waste Strategist,Post-Landfill Action Network,6582,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2243,"Waste Reduction - Connecting the Student Experience, Academics, and Sustainability","Wayne State University embarked upon an expansive campus-wide waste reduction program to support the goals of the Strategic Plan and Sustainability Plan. These planning documents call for increased operational efficiency in campus facilities and achieving a 60% diversion rate in recycling on campus by 2022. The program is built upon a focus on education, training, engagement, and process improvement. Importantly, students have an active role in the program's execution and two student leaders in this initiative will participate in the delivery of the presentation. A series of meetings were held to explain the program to stakeholders. This included several interactions with custodial services to understand process challenges and advance collaboration. Also, professional development training was developed and held with the custodial staff for process improvement. Next, the program included an assessment of the recycling needs and challenges in each building. A waste audit was conducted to fully understand the building habits involving waste disposal. This was followed by strategic placement of current and new recycling bins to maximize exposure and use in each building. The educational component sought to increase understanding of the recycling program and its benefits through building-level workshops and tabling. This effort was simultaneously coupled with a social media and promotion campaign that featured recycling/waste reduction best practices conveyed through tips, reminders, reporting, and success stories. Additionally, faculty utilized the program as a service learning project to expose students to real-world sustainability challenges related to recycling and waste reduction. The presentation takes a holistic approach toward assessment and solving campus challenges around recycling and waste reduction.

2281,The Compost Catastrophe: Our Adventure to Residence Hall Composting at Appalachian State University,"Appalachian State University has been composting on campus since 1999 and has grown and developed into one of the most successful programs in the country. Our facility has the ability to accept yard/garden waste, wood waste, pre and post-consumer food wastes including meats and dairy, as well as some manure and agricultural waste. Because of this proven success, and the many needs for compost on our campus, in the Fall of 2018 we expanded collection for compost into the residence halls. Through this process, we've found solutions to many of the common issues proposed when discussing the creation of a dorm composting program. This has allowed us to have a bigger presence in the dorms. Our Eco-Reps, a group of elected students that sit on the Resident Hall Council in each of their buildings, act as liaisons between housing and our Office of Sustainability being responsible for compost education and training. We created door hangers with specific instructions for collecting and storing food scraps and other compostable materials for compost collection and strategically placed compost collection bins outside of each residence hall. While this program has helped us further our zero waste education on campus, we've had numerous challenges with managing contamination. Compost bins are co-located with recycling and landfill bins, thus getting extremely contaminated when those bins are not emptied regularly. One solution that we've found to this problem is to have less compost collection bins and instead more centrally locate compost bins in designated drop off locations with more educational signage. By making the drop off locations more of a destination, we are anticipating much lower levels of contamination.",Appalachian State University,4398,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,"compost,residence halls,eco-reps,waste contamination",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Rebecca Walton,Sustainability Outreach Coordinator,Appalachian State University,4398,Jennifer Maxwell,Sustainability Program Manager,Appalachian State University,4398,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The program features piloting central waste stations and transitioning from traditional full-size trash containers, right-sizing infrastructure to triple stream compost and recycling stations with small side-saddle type 5G trash containers. The program has included extensive training for all stakeholders, and pre/post detailed waste audits. The session will highlight the issues that arose from balancing shifting streams while maintaining best practices for successful execution. This will provide key learnings for the audience to use in their own campus facilities. The session will also focus on culture and communication which are driving factors in the success of campus recycling and zero waste programs.

2073,Learning From Failure: Designing an Accessible Waste Management System,"Along with institutions around the world, Humber College in Toronto Canada (over 31,000 full-time students on two campuses), continues to struggle to reduce and manage waste effectively. In 2017, Humber reported a 72% diversion rate, however, an efficient waste management system goes well beyond a diversion rate and diversion rate isn't necessarily a good indicator of success. The college has numerous programs (e.g. recycling, compost, battery recycling, pen recycling, campus cleanups, etc.) to support the campus community, but has been receiving consistent feedback that our system previously designed for the whole campus, did not accommodate individual or departmental needs. As a result in 2018, Humber began designing a more accessible system by conducting discussions with individual faculties, shadowing staff, and surveying students. Using the information gathered, Humber ran a pilot of its waste strategy (new bins, signage, training, education) in one building on campus to gather feedback and further refine its approach. This process differs from traditional waste management plans as it embraces principles from Community Based Social Marketing and considers unique barriers and needs (psychological, physical, and systemic) facing a diverse campus community. Success stories from Humber's waste management approach will be discussed, which includes contamination rates and engagement levels of students, faculty, and staff in waste management.

UK POPs was designed to encourage the campus community to consider the impact of single use plastic consumption and how to be part of the solution. To do this, students, faculty, and staff volunteered to take a pledge to reduce their plastic consumption and in return received reusable items-aluminum water bottle, fabric shopping bag, and metal straw- to use as substitutes for common single use plastic items. A student-led research study on behavioral change was paired with the campaign to evaluate the efficacy of the individual giveaway items in reducing the use of disposable plastics. A series of surveys were sent to participants before and after receiving the reusable items to understand how plastic consumption changed. Thanks to the unique partners involved with this campaign, the initial survey was completed by 1,900 campus community members and more than 700 responses to two follow up surveys have been received. This session will highlight the results of the applied student research and frame them in a way that is hopefully replicable by other campuses seeking to reduce single-use plastics.

2259,Breaking the Disposable Mindset: How to Reuse Garment Waste on University Campuses,"Textile waste has become one of the leading issues in sustainability. With millions of tons of this waste produced annually, it can begin to seem as if there's no solution to the growing problem. University campuses are experiencing this issue now more than ever. The accumulation of annual athletic waste, the one-time use of caps and gowns, and the burden of college students frequently moving in-and-out of dorms is only adding to the rapid increase in textile waste. This poster presentation shifts its focus to various facets of potential waste outlets within the University of Louisville. During each season of the year, there will be a call for clothing donations, old caps and gowns, and previously used athletic-wear from students and alumni. The donations will be re-purposed or recycled with the help of student organizations and communities, such as Greek life, fiber and multimedia art students, theater students, and leadership groups. Following the re-purposing and recycling processes, some of the textile will remain with theater and studio art students to serve as supplies, tools, forms of media, and costumes. However, used athletic gear has been almost completely neglected in conversations pertaining to university sustainability. Clothing articles that cannot be resold (practice gear, ripped/damaged jerseys, undergarments, cleats, etc.) are thrown away. The presenters have proposed to give players and coaches an option to recycle unwanted/unusable textiles. Athletic-specific textiles can be re-purposed into athletic-wear to be donated or sold for a small price to local athletics throughout neighboring communities (specifically in impoverished areas). The presentation will demonstrate the powerful results that can occur within the university and local communities by utilizing a circular method of production. In addition, this re-purposing method will act as a template for all interested, sustainable-minded universities and students.",University of Louisville,1647,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,"reuse,recycling,thrift,textiles & apparel",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Landann Brown,Undergraduate Student,University of Louisville,1647,Matthew Harper,Undergraduate Student,University of Louisville,1647,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is even more confusion about what steps each of us can take. For colleges and universities, it's become very complicated to implement alternatives and empower the students with concrete actions.

2437,Promoting Sustainable Behavior Through the use of Personal Recycling Bins in Residential Halls,"College campuses provide a unique stage for waste diversion and sustainability efforts, especially in on campus housing. As students from all over the nation and world come and go from the residence halls within a matter of years, the need for sustainability education is constant for the changing population. According to Oklahoma State University's Department of Housing and Residential Life, the large majority of the nearly 6,000 students living on campus are freshmen. This gives the university only a short amount of time to build a foundation of sustainable living that will last throughout college and beyond. Furthermore, the diverse nature of universities means students have a wide range of familiarity with recycling programs. Because recycling is not a standardized practice among cities throughout the nation, significant differences exist between programs. The university's recycling program is likely different from that of the student's hometown, calling for education outreach regarding the specific recycling guidelines for the university. Understanding these challenges, the Oklahoma State University Sustainability Office and student Eco-Representatives launched a pilot program in hopes of increasing the university's on-campus housing recycling rate while decreasing contamination. While steps have already been taken to achieve these goals--such as placing recycling bins in more convenient locations, prompts, flyers, and signage--introducing personal recycling bins in each room is yet another way the university strives to be more sustainable. The bin pilot program was also aided by providing students with personal recycling bins and flyers while completing visual audits and surveys to determine the effectiveness of the program. Through visual dumpster audits, pre- and post- surveys, and feedback from residents, we have identified improvements that will allow for successful implementation of recycling bins in every residential room on campus.",Oklahoma State University,1071,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,Housing & Residence Life,,"residence halls,bins & receptacles,waste reduction,recycling",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Kristen Ball,Senior Sustainability Intern,Oklahoma State University,1071,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Ball_1836.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17923/1530_Ball_1836.pdf,,,,,,
2509,Driving Zero Waste Programming with Data in Dorms and Dining at Stanford,"Stanford is on the path to zero waste by 2030. Stanford's Residential & Dining Enterprises represents one-third of the campus where over 12,000 students live and eat. In this workshop we will share best practices in using data to drive zero waste programming that reduces waste, drives diversion and educates students to be conscious of their waste production for the rest of their lives. Residences: Upgrades in interior and exterior infrastructure over the last three years has resulted in a 20% reduction in serviced landfill capacity. Data collected on every pick up along with behavior change research has provided useful insights to where programs are working successfully and where opportunities exist to improve diversion. All students have access to 5 stream collection, including composting - from their kitchens and bathroom paper towels at over 300 buildings and 150 enclosures. Give and Go: Year round students have access to donation stations where clothes, shoes, small appliances, packaged food and other goods can be given to those in need. In 2018 over 40 tons of material was donated. Dining Hall Waste Measurement and Reduction: Stanford Dining has used a waste tracking platform to reduce food waste by 24% since implementation. Dining Hall Food Rescue: What cannot be reduced is either donated through a first of its kind refrigerated food truck that brings food directly into neighboring communities, such as local schools, to redistribute the food. Animal Feed: Post-consumer waste from the dining halls is processed by Stanford's waste hauler into animal feed which is a higher use on the EPA's Food Recovery Hierarchy. Student Learning and Engagement: Students are incorporated into all aspects of Stanford's waste reduction efforts. A group of 40 student interns helps with a variety of activities including auditing waste streams, observing student behaviors, developing animated videos to teach students how to sort the most confusing items and weighing and packaging.",Stanford University,4127,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,Dining Services,Housing & Residence Life,"zero waste,data,residence halls,campus dining",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Kristin Parineh,"Manager, R&DE Sustainability and Utility Programs",Stanford University,4127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Parineh_1333.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18277/0830_Parineh_1333.pdf,,,,,,

1865,Piloting a Pay-As-You-Throw Program at an Institution of Higher Education,"In January 2019, Yale University launched a Pay As You Throw (PAYT) pilot program, the first of its kind at an institution of higher education within the United States. PAYT is a materials management model where entities (typically homeowners) are charged for the amount of trash that they throw away, much like they are charged for other usage-based utilities such as electricity. By charging for garbage sent to the landfill or incinerator but lower to no charge for recycling and composting, this model has been shown to encourage more environmentally-sustainable waste habits. The Yale Sustainability Plan 2025 includes a goal is to create, pilot, and assess a PAYT system at Yale by January 2022. The steps for exploring the feasibility of PAYT at Yale include three phases of work: the formation of a task force, development of a strategy, and implementation and assessment of a pilot program. Goals from the pilot include reducing waste and increasing recycling by incentivizing participants to consider ways of generating less trash. It aims to transform the Yale community into conscious consumers by providing detailed information about disposal patterns. A successful PAYT program would result in decreased use of natural resources as well as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants. It is also an opportunity for academic research and collaboration between faculty, students, and operational staff. This session will describe each phase of the pilot program, from development to implementation to preliminary findings. Particular attention will be paid to the process of developing the pilot-including research, how this program was tailored for a university (and therefore differs from the standard municipal approach), data analysis, stakeholder engagement, and a communications plan. The session will include lessons learned so that other institutions can determine whether and how they might want to implement a similar program.",Yale University,3678,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,"recycling,waste reduction,incentives",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Lindsay Crum,Metrics & Program Manager,Yale University,3678,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Crum_1161.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16026/1400_Crum_1161.pdf,,,,,,
2054,Planning for Zero Waste and Beyond,"Zero waste has been the ultimate goal for many campus recycling and sustainability departments for the last two decades. Stanford has made great strides towards this target, increasing its landfill diversion rate from 30% in 1994 to over 64% in 2016, has developed a Zero Waste Plan to achieve its 90% diversion goal by 2030 while incorporating circular economy thinking: maximizing green procurement, prioritizing source reduction and reuse, and optimizing recycling, composting and material recovery programs. Stanford has developed a model incorporating the above strategies, and peer reviews also reveal that a sizable opportunity for cost savings from efficiency improvements is possible once the implementation course shifts to zero waste programming. 2,000 miles away, Indiana University has been making similar strides towards its diversion goals, and is in the process of developing an actionable, data-driven plan to reduce waste generation and increase diversion in spite of unique regional processing and infrastructure challenges. For this panel, Stanford and Indiana University along with their industry partner Cascadia Consulting will discuss the zero waste planning process and share case studies highlighting waste reduction and diversion successes. The content will focus on engaging stakeholders from diverse departments to develop holistic, impactful strategies within the following focus areas: 1) REDUCE waste by working with procurement departments and dining teams to develop enforceable purchasing policies and practices that prioritize waste minimization and recoverability. 2) REUSE existing material through comprehensive surplus collection and resale programs. 3) RECYCLE and COMPOST efficiently and with low contamination rates by collaborating with local haulers and campus planners, and developing engaging and effective outreach and education campaigns for the broader campus community.",Stanford University,4127,Indiana University Bloomington,6354,"Cascadia Consulting Group, Inc.",6326,,,,,,,Waste,Coordination & Planning,,,,,"zero waste,planning,recycling,reuse",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Fahmida Bangert,"Director, Sustainability and Business Services (former AASHE chair)",Stanford University,4127,Makayla Bonney,Sustainability Staff,Indiana University Bloomington,6354,Stefan Moedritzer,Senior Associate,"Cascadia Consulting Group, Inc.",6326,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1876,A Proven Upstream Funding Model for Waste Management from the University of Kentucky,"The University of Kentucky funds several of its materials management programs by charging all university accounts a disposal fee each time they purchase materials and supplies. This system has been in place for 25 years and has evolved as the materials management needs of the campus have grown. In this session, attendees will learn how this surcharge was established, how it is managed and adjusted, and how it is used to promote landfill diversion and safe disposal of a wide variety of waste streams. If you are looking for innovative ways of funding waste disposal, don't miss this session. Background: In 1994 the University of Kentucky established an 'Environmental Surcharge' that is imposed on the purchase of a broad range of materials, supplies, and capital equipment at the time of acquisition to cover the costs associated with the disposal of hazardous and radioactive material. Disposal costs for these materials had increased exponentially in the previous decade prompting University officials to develop a stable and fair funding mechanism. In 1997, the University expanded the scope of programs covered by the fee to include recycling. More recently, the structure of the surcharge was adapted to include funding for the University's Surplus Property Program. The fee is not currently used to cover the waste hauling contract for landfill-bound materials. In 2017-2018, the Environmental Surcharge generated $6,001,019.89 million. 65% ($3,899,602.14) of this was earmarked to Environmental Health and Safety to cover disposal of hazardous materials, lab inspections and biological safety. 24% ($1,421,467.88) was earmarked to the Recycling Program to cover equipment purchases, personnel costs, service contracts, and more. The remaining 11% ($669,102.14) was earmarked for Surplus Property to cover costs associated with the collection, organization, and sale and/or disposal of all surplus property.",University of Kentucky,1600,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Coordination & Planning,Investment & Finance,,Facilities Management,Finance & Administration,"waste management,funding,waste diversion,materials management",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Shane Tedder,Sustainability Officer,University of Kentucky,1600,Rachel Eldridge,"Business Officer, Environmental Health and Safety",University of Kentucky,1600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_Tedder_1202.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16060/1445_Tedder_1202.pdf,,,,,,

2087,Pursuing Zero Waste Goals Through Student-Led Projects,"Implementing a closed loop waste processing system at University of California, Berkeley is of high priority to achieving the campus' and the larger UC system's goal of reaching Zero Waste by 2020. One aspect of this system is processing literal tons of organic waste - which is no easy feat! The Vermicomposting team at UC Berkeley has been working since Spring 2017 to bring a large scale worm bin to campus to help process organic waste. Our project is funded by a The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) grant, and provides students experience in environmental project management. This presentation will discuss the challenges of implementing student-led sustainability projects within the bureaucracy of a university and the lessons learned from the process. The Vermicomposting Project is under the umbrella of the on-campus Student Environmental Resource Center (SERC). In order to advance responsible consumption and production on the UC Berkeley campus, the project aims to close the loop between on-campus dining hall food waste and the surrounding edible landscape and campus gardens. With community support, we hope to establish an outreach program to teach local elementary schools about the value of composting. This project has been in the works for two years and has faced some roadblocks along the way. Stakeholders in our project include the housing facility managers, residential dining hall, and an environmentally themed residential community. In collaborating with various departments, we have learned to balance different interests of stakeholders and developed an integrative program. As a student-led project, we have and will face challenges with institutionalizing the program.","University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Campus Engagement,,,,,"zero waste,compost,vermiculture,student engagement,closed loop",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Courtney McGuire,"Undergraduate Student, Project Supervisor","University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1892,Social Sustainability at NAU: Implementing Menstrual Cups on Campus,"This presentation describes an initiative carried out in Spring of 2019 at Northern Arizona University (NAU) that made free menstrual cups available to the NAU student body. The NAU Green Fund partnered with the NAU Health Promotion Office and Dot International to purchase and distribute menstrual cups as part of a sustainability and women's health campaign on campus. This is a unique proposal because, while a few universities have invested in free feminine hygiene products, very few have made menstrual cups free and available to students. This is a groundbreaking project that can be easily replicated in universities across the country that advocates for environmental and social sustainability. Using a menstrual cup is a waste-free alternative, so providing them to an entire student population promotes environmental sustainability. An individual uses about 9,000 disposable pads/tampons in a lifetime, so if every student switched to a reusable menstrual cup, this would significantly reduce plastic waste! This proposal also incorporates social sustainability in its emphasis on women's health issues and the importance of promoting healthy discourse around women's health and menstruation. Overall, this is an exciting project that takes a holistic view towards sustainability and improving the lives of menstruating individuals.",Northern Arizona University,0567,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,"waste reduction,women,hygiene products",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Bryce Thayer,"Public Relations Specialist, NAU Green Fund",Northern Arizona University,0567,Owen Murphy,Green Fund Treasurer,Northern Arizona University,0567,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Thayer_1244.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16111/1400_Thayer_1244.pptx,,,,,,
1950,"Fighting Irish, Fighting Food Waste: Converting Food Waste into Energy at Notre Dame","Nearly 40% of all food in the United States goes uneaten, and 95% of all wasted food winds up in the landfill. At Notre Dame, food and hospitality is a tremendous part of campus culture. Our University has numerous initiatives aligned with EPA's food waste hierarchy (e.g. food rescue, food reuse, feeding the hungry, feeding animals), but recognized that our remaining food waste at our two dining halls and catering unit amounted to 10% of our overall campus waste stream. Numerous student-led projects identified the need for a food waste solution. Thanks in part to the research of a sustainability intern, as well as building off prior student food waste research projects, the University made a capital investment in a food waste solution that pairs the Grind2Energy technology with a local anaerobic digester. The University invested in three systems and will divert from the landfill approximately 400 tons of non-consumable food waste a year. This is how the technology works: Food waste is collected in brightly colored bins that have messaging 'food waste into energy' and brought to a centralized grind table where it is macerated through a commercial grinder and piped to a 5,000 gallon tank. Every couple of weeks the food waste is serviced by a septic hauler and trucked to a nearby dairy farm where it is added to anaerobic digester operation. The digester converts the food waste along with dairy-waste into methane through cogeneration. The electricity created heats the dairy farm and is also sold back to the grid. This session will present a case example and explain the technology used, training of staff, and results to date. The session will also spend time providing our evaluation criteria for investing in this technology compared to alternative approaches (e.g. composting, biobins) and will encourage audience participation in sharing food waste reduction initiatives on their respective campuses.",University of Notre Dame,3704,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Energy,Food & Dining,,,,"food waste,biodigesters",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Allison Mihalich,"Senior Program Director, Sustainablity",University of Notre Dame,3704,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Mihalich_1646.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16258/0830_Mihalich_1646.pptx,,,,,,
2321,Closing the Loop: Connecting Education and Operations with a Food Waste Dehydrator Project,"In October 2018, in order to meet our sustainability goals and provide relevant connections to coursework in several of our program areas, Western Technical College student government and the facilities department partnered to purchase and deploy a pre-consumer food waste dehydrator in our main kitchen. Thus far, the project has kept four tons of food waste out of the landfill by turning it into one ton of biomass. Students amend the biomass into a usable growing medium in which to grow the micro-greens that are served in our campus restaurant salad bar. Moreover, we anticipate savings in waste hauling and the purchase of soil and potential savings in landscaping costs. The food dehydrator project engages students in our culinary arts program, our horticulture education program, in addition to a local not-for-profit organization and demonstrates to our students and community the benefits of closing one food production/consumption loop. This project is still young and very much a work in progress.

2032,Don't Let it Go to Waste: Three Scrappy Strategies for Managing Food Waste and Organics in Kentucky,"Food waste is all too often seen as nothing more than 'trash.' Yet capturing food waste for positive transformation can and should be a key component of campus sustainability efforts. Food waste recovery can connect student service to efforts to address food insecurity. Composting enables universities to divert organics from the landfill, avoiding climate-disrupting methane production and offers the opportunity to improve soil health on campus grounds. All aspects of food waste reduction and recovery can benefit students, staff and faculty through education, service, and research opportunities. Kentucky is not an easy market for organics diversion. Landfill tipping fees are low, there are limited municipal options available, and private sector markets for food waste are all but nonexistent. In this environment, Western Kentucky University, the University of Louisville and the University of Kentucky all have experience with organics diversion efforts that failed. Despite those setbacks and the difficult market, all three Universities have been able to establish successful composting and food waste management programs. Each campus has taken a unique approach, leading to three distinct models that utilize different composting methods, financial mechanisms, labor sources, local partnerships, and hauling/site selection. Two key factors unite all three models: the goal of reducing/recovering food waste and using the campus as a living lab. In this session, each university will highlight its programs and describe how they are structured, funded, and managed. We will also discuss the failures, challenges, and successes that we each experienced along the way.",University of Kentucky,1600,Western Kentucky University,1816,University of Louisville,1647,Aramark Higher Education,3691,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,Grounds,,,,"compost,food waste",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Shane Tedder,Sustainability Officer,University of Kentucky,1600,Elizabeth Gafford,Coordinator of Resource Conservation,Western Kentucky University,1816,Justin Mog,Assistant to the Provost for Sustainability Initiatives,University of Louisville,1647,Ellen Trahan,Sustainability Coordinator,Aramark Higher Education,3691,Carolyn Gahn,Sustainability Manager,Aramark Higher Education,3691,Brian Barnes,EcoReps Director,University of Louisville,1647,,,,,,,,,0915_Barnes_1588.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16559/0915_Barnes_1588.pdf,0915_Gafford_1588.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16554/0915_Gafford_1588.pptx,0915_Mog_1588.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16556/0915_Mog_1588.pptx,0915_Tedder_1588.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16553/0915_Tedder_1588.pdf
2465,University of Kentucky Organic Waste Composting Pilot Project: Growing Sustainability Partnerships,"In 2019, the University of Kentucky (UK) College of Agriculture, Food and Environment, UK Dining, Aramark, UK Physical Plant (Waste, Recycling, & Grounds), and UK Sustainability began a strategic partnership to compost campus green and food wastes. The compost product is utilized as a land-applied soil amendment to meet crop nutrient demand and build soil health, based on soil samples taken as a part of the UK farms' nutrient management plans. We are also using the finished compost product as an alternative campus landscaping material. This pilot project will be used to evaluate the economics, logistics, scaling, and the operational plan for a composting operation designed to address a greater portion of the campus green and food waste streams. The composting management team will develop guidance regarding facilities, equipment needs, personnel procedures, and specific logistics considerations synthesized from the observations, results, and a benefit-cost analysis of this project. Key outcomes of this project include: 1) Total landfilled waste reduction. 2) Determination of program labor, equipment, facilities, and maintenance requirements. 3) Evaluation of potential logistical/process efficiency improvements. 4) Beneficial reuse of a value-added compost product 5) Reduction of landscaping/fertilizer costs. This project will also be leveraged to engage UK and surrounding community members on food system sustainability topics through food-waste/composting education and outreach programming. Education and outreach programming will focus on raising participants' awareness of the impact of their consumption decisions on food waste generation and landfill diversion. We hope to be able to expand this pilot project to additional campus locations over the next several years.",University of Kentucky,1600,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,Grounds,,Dining Services,,"compost,food waste,soils,waste reduction",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Lee Moser,Agriculture Extension Associate Senior,University of Kentucky,1600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Moser_1859.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/18079/1530_Moser_1859.pdf,,,,,,
2429,Clean Plates at State-Raising Food Waste Awareness in Residential Halls at Michigan State University,"Clean Plates at State is a food waste audit conducted in all nine residential dining halls on Michigan State University's campus. This program helps to put environmental sustainability into perspective for campus diners, encouraging them to take simple steps to avoid wasting food. The main goal is to determine the amount of post-consumer food waste at MSU dining halls and analyze its implications for culinary services. Through our partnerships with academics, this program enhances the student experience by expanding their opportunity to learn and increase their enrichment of community, economic, and sustainable living. Our method starts with weighing three samples of each type of dish used in every dining hall. This weight provides the tare for our scales, so the weight of the plate does not factor into the weight of the food waste. These numbers are recorded into the registers and then are plugged into the scales. We conduct the audit during two different time periods, lunch 11:30am-1:30pm and dinner 5:00pm-7:00pm at each dining hall. Data collected during these shifts include total number of patrons who ate at the dining hall, number of patrons with food waste, number of zero waste patrons, total pounds of food wasted, average food wasted per person in pounds and in ounces. To count the number of 'Clean Plates' or waste free plates, a volunteer would hold a clicker and use it to count the number of zero waste plates we saw during the measurement period. Waste free is defined as all edible food is eaten; therefore, bones, peels, and other inedible pieces did not count against the patron. Clean Plates at State has been carried out every fall semester since 2012. Success can be determined when comparing averages from the first audit to the ninth, in 2012 the average ounces wasted per patron was 3.88 and in 2018 it was 3.16. These numbers are used to encourage staff and students to be mindful of their waste and how they can personally help environmental concerns.",Michigan State University,0439,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Food & Dining,,,Dining Services,,"waste audits,food waste,campus dining,on-campus collaboration",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Carla Iansiti,RHS Sustainability Officer,Michigan State University,0439,Emma Bellini,"Student Assistant, RHS Sustainability",Michigan State University,0439,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530_Bellini_1853.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/17798/1530_Bellini_1853.pdf,,,,,,
2359,Raising Food Waste Awareness in Residential Halls - Michigan State University,"A large factor in creating a more sustainable economy will come from changes in human behavior with an effort to live more sustainability. Part of this change will be individuals minimizing waste. Michigan State University has introduced awareness efforts through several programs and initiatives, specifically the Clean Plates at State food waste audit program. This program helps raise awareness about food waste affecting the environment as well as provides the university with data about post-consumer food waste behavior throughout campus. Through our partnerships with academics, this program enhances the student experience by expanding their opportunity to learn and increase their enrichment of community, economic, and sustainable living. This session will discuss the logistics of making this grassroots, primarily student managed program successful and how other universities can bring something similar to their institution. Clean Plates at State began in 2012 to encourage students to be mindful of their waste while eating in the campus dining halls and continues today due to the positive responses the programs receive each year. The program consists of two audits per dining hall, one during a lunch portion and one during a dinner portion. Sustainability staff and student volunteers measure customer food waste using an electronic scale that records a per pound waste factor for data purposes. Once the program has conducted audits at each dining hall, staff then begin the process of accumulating data for the final report. In Fall 2018 there were approximately 516,800 pounds of food wasted just during our audit, which is equivalent to 3.16 ounces per customer in one day. Once completed, this data is provided to university staff and students to show the impact of food waste. Data is also converted to show staff how much money is being lost based on food wasted. These numbers are used to encourage staff and students to be mindful of their waste and how they can help.

2489,Outdoor Waste Receptacle Removal: A Creative Approach to Waste Management,"Institutions across the country have found success in strategically phasing out outdoor waste receptacles and focusing their waste efforts on the management of indoor waste streams. Though perhaps counterintuitive to outdoor waste and diversion goals, removing outdoor bins can decrease ground litter, decrease staff time in litter cleanup, and gives more control of the movement of waste on a campus. This presentation will highlight the methodologies and successes of two large Midwestern universities, Indiana University and Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), in their efforts to remove outdoor waste receptacles. The results of this approach from two public institutions, one a large suburban campus (IU), the other mid-size and urban, suggests that this method has the potential to be successful at a wide spectrum of institutions.

2297,Worm Poop Creates Sustainable Economy!,"After almost fifteen years of trying to turn worm poop into sustainable community and economy, the good news is that this is possible. It's a good deal of work, though, since worms should be managed like livestock. Worms can contribute to the building of community gardens, education programs, work-release programs, guerrilla gardening, and urban renewal. Worms can be managed by otherwise vulnerable populations to create the backbone of a sustainable economy that is equitable, rich in carbon-negative activity, a producer of powerful foods, and a developer of nurturing relationships. Attendees will learn to create small, scalable vermiculture habitats, and they will receive both worm poop and red wiggler worms as part of attending (these may be donated to a local garden.) Relationship building and leadership functions within worm-centric social and economic structures will also be explored through metaphor and practical examples. Attendees will learn to care for the worms like livestock, and they will see many examples of the various ways red wigglers can be at the foundation of several different kinds of sustainable economy.",University of Louisville,1647,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Grounds,,,,,"vermiculture,compost",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Brian Barnes,EcoReps Director,University of Louisville,1647,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2264,Our Community Composting Project,"The University of Louisville Community Composting Project has been creating compost with and for the community for the past ten years. Sourcing our organic material from local coffee shops, restaurants, and community members, we have turned more than 350 tons of food waste into compost and vermicompost during this time. In return, anyone from the community can take this compost for personal or communal use. This cycle of giving and receiving between the community and university has created a closed loop of waste, benefiting members of each group, as well as bringing them together under common goals and interests. Though there is little monetary exchange within this system, the basis of a healthy economy is ever present. Our composting operation facilitates a regular exchange of goods, services, and, most importantly, ideas between the citizens/businesses of Louisville and the faculty, staff, and students of the university. Members of all groups volunteer organic material and labor to the project each week, during which these individuals interact with each other, imparting knowledge, ideas, and opportunities to each other. The nutrient-rich soil that this process produces is used in personal and community gardens all over the city to then produce fruits and vegetables for others, the waste of which will potentially return to one of our compost heaps. The equitable model for composting that we strive to implement is one in which many members of different groups have come together for the benefit of themselves and the rest of the city. This project has created an alternative economic system based on communication, collaboration, and cooperation that serves to benefit the health and welfare of our community and university members, as well as the overarching social, environmental, and economic conditions we all function within. This is a design and practice that all universities across the nation could use to improve their institutions and surrounding communities.",University of Louisville,1647,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Public Engagement,,,,,"compost,food waste,closed loop,collaboration,community engagement",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Joshua Cagle,Composting Intern,University of Louisville,1647,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2034,Sustainable Economy in Labs: I2SL's Landfill Diversion Working Group Pursues Upstream Dysfunction,"Researcher time is for research! Join us in calling for upstream innovations to build a circular economy and protect valuable scholar time! Achieving sustainability in laboratory settings with regard to waste minimization and landfill diversion requires a level of dedication and creativity that is above and beyond a typical lab user's daily objectives. Researchers want to focus completely on the science at hand, but some find themselves distracted by the amount of waste produced as a by-product of that important work. As America's leading research and teaching institutions make progress toward comprehensive sustainability goals, focus on solid waste materials that are streaming from lab buildings are strengthening, and collaboration between key stakeholders within each institution and affiliated industries is essential. The production and disposal of lab materials used in research, teaching, and science represent a life cycle that begs to become a closed loop. No one entity is accountable for the responsible management of materials; rather, a collective obligation exists and begs to be reckoned with. Members of the International Institute for Sustainable Laboratories (I2SL) Landfill Diversion Working Group (LDWG) will present on progress toward challenges and opportunities over the last two years, with two areas of emphasis. In alignment with the LDWG's efforts to influence upstream product development and the impact on landfill diversion, the session will focus on opportunities and challenges related to the needs and responsibilities of: (1) manufacturers and suppliers toward development and marketing of materials that reduce landfill waste, and (2) end users of lab materials toward reduction of waste output and proper diversion of products from the landfill.",Emory University,3931,University of Georgia,2188,,,,,,,,,Waste,Purchasing,Research,,,,"research labs,green labs,waste diversion",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Kelly O'Day Weisinger,Assistant Director of Sustainability,Emory University,3931,Star Scott,Green Labs Program Coordinator,University of Georgia,2188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1445_ODayWeisinger_1608.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16564/1445_ODayWeisinger_1608.pdf,,,,,,
1935,EcoCoin Program as an Effective Alternative to Banning Plastic Bags,"On a small scale, localized bans and ordinances against single use plastic bags present many challenges: How will it impact local businesses' bottom line? Will customers go elsewhere? Who enforces it? While recyclable, paper alternatives to plastic bags also have significant environmental consequences. The best solution is durable, reusable bags, or simply no bag at all! While momentum is building in some states for broader sweeping legislation against single use plastic bags, programs that entice consumers to choose a better alternative can help serve as a here and now solution. In 2017, UConn's Office of Environmental Policy partnered with Barnes & Noble to implement the EcoCoin program in its on-campus bookstore. In the past year, the program helped prevent over 12,000 single use plastic bags from being used while raising over $600 for local charities. The program is now being expanded to regional campuses and other community retailers. In this session, the audience will learn from UConn's experience how to approach campus vendors to replicate an EcoCoin program that is beneficial to all involved.",University of Connecticut,2131,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Purchasing,,,,,"plastic bags,reusable bags,single-use plastic,waste reduction",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Patrick McKee,Sustainability Program Manager,University of Connecticut,2131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_McKee_1518.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16223/0830_McKee_1518.pptx,,,,,,
2226,Closed-Loop Mechanical Recycling of Polylactic Acid Filament in 3D Printing Labs,"3D Printing has furthered innovation at UC Berkeley by providing access to new research methods and tools. However, considering the benefits of 3D printing, the large amount of plastic waste generated from use creates a problem for the future of the technology's sustainability and feasibility. The Zero Waste Research Center at UC Berkeley is developing a closed-loop mechanical recycling system that recycles failed 3D printed prints and other polylactic acid (PLA) plastic waste into 3D printing filament that can be redistributed to campus maker spaces. Our goal is to achieve cost and resource savings through the development of valuable end products while also diverting PLA waste from the landfill. The research and institutionalization of this closed-loop PLA mechanical recycling process will also serve as a model for the larger-scale project of creating the first Plastics Recycling Research Facility at UC Berkeley. This research facility, located at the Richmond Field Station on UC Berkeley property, will process the University's plastic waste through mechanical recycling procedures, help expand their reuse and recycling programs, and create research and education opportunities for its students. Having purchased an industrial grinder, Filabot extruder, and spooler, we are currently in the research and development stage which is focused on experimenting with and refining our mechanical recycling process. This procedure involves grinding up PLA waste into small pellets then extruding the plastic into an industry-grade filament of consistent diameter. I will utilize visuals of the recycling set-up, data regarding filament properties, and filament samples to convey the research process as well as the impact of this exciting combination of science and sustainability. I will also present challenges faced regarding the bureaucracy that comes with implementing such circular economies, and especially how to approach and solve these problems.","University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,Waste,Research,,,,,"recycling,waste reduction,closed loop,cost savings,research labs",10/28/2019,AASHE,Poster,Lauren Irie,Undergraduate Student,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2040,"On-Campus Composting: How to Start, Evolve, and Overcome Challenges","Is your campus considering starting an on-site composting program, but doesn't know where to start or which system to choose? Or does your campus want to evolve its program or find solutions to its compost challenges? Either way, you are not alone! On-site composting systems are increasingly being recognized as important food waste diversion strategies to meet institutional zero waste goals while revitalizing soils and engaging the campus community in sustainable action and research. This session will combine the diverse experiences and lessons learned from several institutions to inform the field on how to start or grow an on-site composting program, and address current program challenges. Participants will be led through several major stages of the planning and operation stages of a compost program from selecting processing technologies, managing program operations, and applying the finished product. Panelists will share experiences and case studies from their campuses which represent a wide range of climate regions, campus size, and food waste sources. Case studies will highlight relative costs, equipment, personnel, engagement and educational/living-lab potentials across technologies and processes. By the end of the session, participants will leave with a better understanding of the pros and cons of different composting systems, as well as various strategies for tackling key challenges that might arise from organics collection to compost application.

1981,True Zero Waste - The Last 10%,"By many definitions, achieving Zero Waste requires a 90% diversion rate of all discarded materials from being land-filled or incinerated. Diverting the last 10% is complex, challenging, and potentially costly. This session will feature panelists who have experience in diverting the most difficult waste streams and are eager to share their strategies, advice, and results. Zero Waste is a goal set by both the College of Charleston and the Medical University of South Carolina to eliminate the concept of waste from processes on campus. By thinking of the traditional waste stream as materials and resources that can and should be reused, they have begun implementing cyclical processes that close the loop of production and replenish themselves indefinitely - a sustainable economy. Through composting and food waste management plus on-campus programs including several TerraCycle recycling programs, such as lab gloves, commonly consumed personal hygiene/beauty products, office supplies and electronics, these institutions have successfully taken on the task of diverting these items from the landfill. Additionally, there is a focus on averting waste in the first place through more thoughtful sourcing of products and careful analysis of products and systems that are adaptable to long term usage. Lastly, there are important social aspects that result from these Zero Waste efforts. Both institutions have implemented strategies for addressing food insecurity, one through multi-departmental partnerships which allows food leftovers to be donated and the other through fresh food donations from their urban farm. Bring your toughest questions and your own examples to this interactive session. Our panelists will share their successes and also where they have come up short.

Eureka College is a small, liberal arts college with a population of approximately 600 students, that has never engaged in any composting of food scraps. The purpose of the 1-month trial was to determine the financial and operational feasibility of a college-supported composting operation in the campus dining hall through analysis of total waste diverted from our landfill, total cost of implementation, and feedback from primary stakeholders. The Eureka composting trial was designed using Goshen College (Goshen, IN) as a model and feedback from Goshen Director of Sustainability, who also shared compost bin design and management advice.

The mantra is ingrained in us from our early childhood, but the attention naturally goes to the first and last R - like a lost middle child. Today, the rise of the circular economy is changing all of that, with new reuse ideas and schemes, from re-commerce to remanufacturing and beyond. But one thing remains unchecked and unresolved: how to manage and support the transparency of these schemes using today's outdated asset management tools. In this session, we'll discuss a new technology that is standardizing, centralizing & connecting surplus asset management practices and systems onto a shared marketplace platform, an innovation that is critical in order for reuse schemes to be successful and adopted at scale. We'll also examine workspace optimization strategies for underutilized assets and why research waste is a particular problem in higher education.

2021,Illuminating the Invisible: How Institutions Address and Afford Social Sustainability,"Rising income inequality, compounded by the eroding purchasing power of low and minimum-wage jobs, make social sustainability a subject of increasing urgency and importance to the most vulnerable members of our campus communities. However, social sustainability is the least visible and potentially the most contentious dimension of sustainability, since examining it illuminates how an institution relates to and compensates its employees and its contractors. This session drills down into some of the most recent results from the Living Wage Policy Study (justwage.org), a five-year multi-phase research project exploring (1) the prevalence and nature and living wage policies in American higher education, and (2) the potential effects of living wage policies, including financial operating margins, bond ratings, institutional rankings/reputation, and media coverage, among others. In this session, we'll discuss the study's findings on three critical questions: 1. How do institutions illuminate the invisible needs and issues of the most vulnerable employees in the campus community? We'll explore different methods used to raise institution-level awareness about social sustainability on college campuses. 2. How do institutions consider and adopt living wage policies or practices? We'll explore different paths to social sustainability taken by a range of institutions. 3. How do institutions afford/pay for living wage policies/practices, and how do they defend those policies during times of financial pressure? We'll discuss both the expected and hidden costs of social sustainability, and how institutions can protect their employees and contractors. Participants can expect an evidence-based presentation followed by a vigorous discussion of the need for and challenges of addressing social sustainability at their institution. We'll begin with a brief overview of the Living Wage Policy Study, upon which this session is based. The middle portion is a briefing on results from the project regarding how institutions: 1. illuminate the invisible social sustainability needs and issues; 2. consider and/or adopt living wage policies and practices; and 2. are able to afford the financial costs of enacting just employment policies and practices. The latter portion of the session will include small group discussions, prompted to respond to the briefing and their assessment.",Saint Joseph's University,0674,,,,,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Campus Engagement,Diversity & Affordability,,,,"living wage,income equality,social justice",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Ken Weidner,Assistant Professor of Management,Saint Joseph's University,0674,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Weidner_1506.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16509/0915_Weidner_1506.pdf,0915_Weidner_1506_1028_193843.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16509/0915_Weidner_1506_1028_193843.pdf,,,,
1959,Building Personal Resilience in a Wellbeing Economy,"As the climate continues to change, weather events are increasingly affecting people in deeply personal ways. Grief, trauma, depression, hopelessness, fatalism and uneasiness are all symptoms. Recent reports by the APA (American Psychological Association) and researchers call for a corresponding need to adequately respond with resources for developing new skills, aptitudes and approaches to increase personal resilience to a changed world. This session will consider emerging options for building personal resilience in a new economy. We will discuss how deep experiences of nature are needed for early-career young people; how awakening to grief, love and beauty may address climate fatalism; how incorporating eco-spiritual group work could have a place in the new economy; and how building relationships on a shared sense of love for a place is key for climate resiliency planning. Some recent examples will include community-college level coursework offered for early career professionals that incorporates climate resilience at the community level with personal resilience building training. One example is a training module provided by the International Transformational Resilience Coalition (ITRC), a network of over 300 mental health, trauma, resilience, faith, and climate leaders focused on the need to proactively build personal and psycho-social-spiritual resilience for climate disruption. Students entering climate change-related careers will need professional support to avoid burnout and other negative effects in their career. One group that is responding to this need is the American Society of Adaptation Professionals (ASAP), which has developed an interactive one-year cohort program, where participants explore personal and professional resilience; discover various traits resilient individuals can obtain to thrive; and gain the skills needed to enhance their own resilience while also fostering resilience in others.",Verdis Group,8491,Strategic Energy Innovations,7850,,,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Air & Climate,Public Engagement,,,,"mental health,grief,resilience",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Kim Morrow,Senior Associate,Verdis Group,8491,Jacob Pollack,Program Manager,Strategic Energy Innovations,7850,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Morrow_1674.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16285/1400_Morrow_1674.pdf,,,,,,

In an effort to maximize on-campus resources, at no cost to students, the VCU Office of Sustainability proposed to develop and run a free store/bike shop/food pantry for all students, faculty and staff, located within The Mansion. This enterprise is titled The Hub. The Hub combines the already-existing on-campus food pantry with the free store. This has raised visibility of the pantry, allowed more students to access the donations and worked toward the removal of the social stigma of food insecurity. Concurrent with these efforts, we will merge RamBikes into this same space. RamBikes provides free bicycle service and education as well as manages both short- and long-term bike loan programs, at no cost. By coalescing these three efforts, we will create a hub for free resources for the university community. The vision for The Hub is a university-initiated effort that promotes equitable access to basic needs through student empowerment, community collaboration and institutional integration. Our aim is to shift cultural consciousness towards understanding the fulfillment of basic needs, which include food and transportation security as well as access to useful homewares and school supplies, which are guaranteed rights for every person. Attendees of this session will learn how an urban university learned from public outcry and used that experience to gather, promote and provide free resources to the university community. We are committed to making VCU a basic needs-secure campus.",Virginia Commonwealth University,1546,,,,,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Campus Engagement,Waste,,,,"free stores,basic needs,food banks & pantries,affordability",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Erin Stanforth,Director of Sustainability,Virginia Commonwealth University,1546,Sara Barton,Learning Garden Coordinator,Virginia Commonwealth University,1546,Sera Erickson,Bicycle Program Coordinator,Virginia Commonwealth University,1546,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Barton_1265.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16117/0830_Barton_1265.pptx,,,,,,
1933,"What Links Climate Change, Biodiversity, Water, and Food Systems? Population","Human population growth is a main driver of environmental degradation. According to Dr. Wynes (2017) in 'The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions' to have one fewer child is a high-impact action with the potential to contribute to systemic change and substantially reduce annual personal emissions. In the 1970s, with the publication of The Population Bomb, the environmental movement began to talk about population and its impact on the environment. The movement has changed over the decades from one that promoted 'control' to one that advocates for population stabilization through education, reproductive justice and empowerment of women. The Center for Biological Diversity supports others working on this critical issue using a rights-based approach. The Center is addressing family planning access and education at campus health clinics. According to the American College Health Association, 95% of colleges provide condoms at the campus health clinic and 67% provide them for free. However, only 54% of college students report using contraception and 4.5% of female students become pregnant (ACHA 2016 Paper and STI Survey Draft Report and National College Health Assessment II Reference Group Report; 2018). In this session, we will unveil a campus health clinic scorecard and results from a national poll summarizing American's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding the nexus of population, consumption, and wildlife habitat. The Center will be joined by Bellevue College who will talk about their use of our Endangered Species Condoms in the classroom. The condoms and the endangered species featured on the packaging are a fun way to get people's attention and start conversations about how human population growth is impacting wildlife, water, food and the climate. Finally, we will facilitate a discussion about how to integrate this topic into campus sustainability issues using a human rights lens.",Center for Biological Diversity,9526,Bellevue College,4486,,,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Campus Engagement,Waste,,,,"population growth,contraception,reproductive health,climate change,biodiversity",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Kelley Dennings,CBD/SMANA,Center for Biological Diversity,9526,Nancy Lane,Faculty,Bellevue College,4486,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1400_Dennings_1512.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16218/1400_Dennings_1512.pptx,,,,,,
2010,Navigating Employee Turnover: A Conversation with a Human Resources Director,"Workforce trends such as low unemployment, high rates of staff turnover, and multiple generations in the workplace have significant implications for sustainability programs. The increased mobility of senior leadership, staff, and faculty challenge collaboration and change management within higher education. Sustainability professionals seeking broader, deeper relationships with local community organizations may similarly find that frequent turnover thwarts the otherwise promising potential of partnership. High turnover vertically and horizontally within institutions presents challenges across multiple domains: transactional, emotional, capacity, and networks. This dynamic also further strains the complicated relationship and potential for collaboration between longstanding tenured faculty members and newer staff or administrators. Other fields offer valuable strategies for successfully navigating a high-turnover environment. Presenters will discuss current workforce drivers and implications outlined by the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources (CUPA-HR), and will draw on corporate sector techniques for retention of institutional knowledge and continuity of work. In this session, a Director of Sustainability will use storytelling and active dialogue to facilitate participant conversation with an experienced higher education Director of Human Resources. Together with the audience we will: discuss the impact of turnover on sustainability initiatives; identify strategies to recruit and retain staff in our own offices; learn how to support campus allies and our own departments towards successful leadership transitions; explore how to adjust our models for systemic change in the face of shortened collective institutional memory; imagine how to leverage changing workforce trends to benefit programs and institutions.",Davidson College,8012,,,,,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Coordination & Planning,,,Human Resources,,"employee retention,employees,employee recruitment,staff engagement",10/29/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Yancey Fouche,Director of Sustainability,Davidson College,8012,Kim Ball,Administrator,Davidson College,8012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0915_Fouche_1440.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16470/0915_Fouche_1440.pptx,,,,,,
2055,"Climate Anxiety, Environmental Grief, and Pretraumatic Stress on Campus and in the College Classroom","Emerging research in higher education shows that students carry an emotional response of fear, anger, frustration, and sadness. Campus environments and college personnel, including faculty, can learn strategies to acknowledge the emotional toll of our climate crisis without overwhelming students into despair. In this panel, three higher ed scholars researching the impact of climate anxiety, environmental grief, and pretraumatic stress will share their most current research findings and recommendations for pedagogical and campus practices. The goal of the session is to elicit a compilation of best practices for teachers across higher education. Jennifer Atkinson is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Washington, Bothell, where she teaches courses on environmental humanities, environmental ethics, and American literature. Her recent seminar on Environmental Grief & Climate Anxiety has been featured in the Seattle Times, Medium, NBC News, High Country News, and other publications and podcasts. Krista Hiser is the Director for Sustainability across Curriculum for the University of Hawaii ten campus system. She creates professional development resources and curricular mechanisms to transform higher education. She also teaches climate communication and a cli-fi literature course: Cli Fi, Sci Fi, and the Culture of Sustainability. Judy Twedt is a doctoral student in interdisciplinary climate communication at the University of Washington. She composes musical scores from climate data so that audiences can connect with the science on an emotional level.

1939,Can a Campus Become a Cornucopia?,"As an urban campus in a food desert, the College of Charleston (CofC), lacks accessible produce. The only grocery store within a mile of campus caters to a high-income area, while low-income students have no affordable option. Food security initiatives joined together after a survey from Charleston YOUth Count revealed that 30% of students reported themselves as food insecure in 2017. The Food Access Committee is a collective that combines the Office of Sustainability (OoS), the Masters of Environmental Studies Sustainable Agriculture (MESSA) Program, and CofC Dining Services in a partnership to improve food access. Suzanna Ellison, a student who's worked on several farms, and managed the campus urban gardens with MESSA since freshman year, works to connect students to the gardens in several ways: raising awareness of the spaces location, involving students to help grow food, and offering the free produce through the OoS's Stone Soup Collective that distributes free soup. Restrictions to access involve maintaining produce quality, creating accessibility points, and cultivating relationships with long term partners who can remain involved through student transience. Student gardening in an urban environment has many social and environmental challenges. While student-led and staff supported initiatives help, feeding a campus of over 10,000 is dependent on outside production. This how the partnership between CofC Dining Services and the OoS is supplementing food access while still sourcing local. Adelaide Bates, came to CofC after founding a farmers market in a rural food desert and began working as the first farmers market lead intern to connect partnering offices and local food hub, Growfood Carolina, to bring produce to campus for the monthly farmers market. Adelaide, now the Sustainability Coordinator for CofC Dining and the OoS, continues growing the market and new food security initiatives, most recently the beginnings of a locally sourced on-campus grocery.

2101,Feminist Fight Club: An Office Survival Workshop,"Are you ever the only womxn in a room of men? Have you ever had a male colleague take credit for your work? Have you ever been spoken over by a man in a meeting? Do you end up taking on additional work around the office like taking notes, sending out meeting invites, or planning office celebrations? Or are you so humble, you have a hard time owning/celebrating the work that you do? This workshops hopes to address the frustrations, challenges, and anger one may find themselves in patriarchal and male-dominated work spaces, as well as how to build confidence and feel empowered as a non-male identifying individual. The sustainability profession is majority woman identifying individuals, yet universities and colleges are led majority by men, the following presenters believe it is important and critical to explore the barriers and challenges that non-male identifying may experience in a patriarchal workplace/institution. In Feminist Fight Club: A Survival Manual for a Sexist Workplace, author Jessica Bennett, explores gender-based workplace problems and scenarios, while providing tactical strategies for womxn to 'fight back', as well as tools for all genders to learn to be better allies. Using the strategies explored in Feminist Fight Club, University of California, Berkeley staff members Sam Lubow, Housing and Dining Sustainability Manager, and Sharon Daraphonhdeth, Director of the Student Environmental Resource Center, will lead a workshop on the helpful techniques learned from Feminist Fight Club, while engaging participants on a dialogue around confidence and empowerment and strategies on navigating male-dominated work spaces. They will facilitate discussion around the strategies that have been employed in different campuses and how these strategies can allow sustainability professionals to be stronger change makers to improve engagement in campus sustainability programs.","University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,Wellbeing & Work,Diversity & Affordability,,,,,"gender,women,gender equality",10/28/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Samantha Lubow,Sustainability Coordinator,"University of California, Berkeley",4473,Sharon Daraphonhdeth,"Director, Student Environmental Resource Center","University of California, Berkeley",4473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1645_Lubow_1589.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/16805/1645_Lubow_1589.pptx,,,,,,

At the same time that worldviews are calcifying on both sides of America's dualistic political spectrum, psychedelics are quickly being accepted as legitimate medicines. In the case of MDMA, Phase III trials are about to start for the treatment of PTSD. Psilocybin has been studied by Johns Hopkins to see if it helps people with cases of terminal illness deal with their own mortality, and it has also been studied relative to depression and addiction. What could these medicines' researched qualities, including emotional wellness and spiritual connection, contribute to the sustainability movement?

2447,Strengths and Improvables: How to Create and Benefit From a Culture of Feedback,"As sustainability professionals, we often find ourselves doing our best to keep many plates spinning. From events to programs to guest lecturing to sustainability strategic plans and joining meetings all over campus to advance the sustainability cause, we're busy 24/7. We spend so much of our time supporting the sustainability goals of our institutions that we can overlook the health and wellbeing of our own organizations-the relationship with our colleagues and interns, processes and policies (or lack thereof), and the overall culture and operations of our office. With so much on our plates, how do we make time to foster the growth of our staff? Ensuring that processes are followed, expectations are set, and are managed well, are foundational. But what if you have to have a difficult conversation with a low-performing staff member? Or if you need to address a miscommunication? Your staff's roles and responsibilities can feel like a given to you. But if they are not articulated as well as they could be to your team, this can be a source of friction. This workshop is a starting point for you to assess the current state of your office or organization. From their experiences, the presenters will share the challenges and successes they have had in developing their teams in their own organizations as well as common threads that have been identified supporting other organizations.

2508,Talent Talks: Bringing Your Environmental Values to Work,"With corporate recruiting season just around the corner, you might be spending time thinking about what might make you stand out in a crowded marketplace. What you may not know is that companies are doing the same thing, to distinguish themselves from their competitors when it comes to attracting and retaining top talent. And many of those companies are increasingly aware that today's top potential employees are looking for more than a paycheck and a 401k-- they want to work for a company that shares their values. Our Talent Talks program is about unlocking that desire for companies to recruit the best and brightest, and equipping you with the skills and knowledge to make sure your potential employer shares your environmental values, whether you are looking for a summer internship or for your first job as a graduate. When should you ask about a company's environmental policies and practices? What are the right questions to ask to see if this is a company you'd be proud to list on your resume?

1840,The Design Thinking Process: User-Centered Solutions to Complex and Confounding Problems,"After a great first year presenting this material at AASHE 2018, we found that a half-day just isn't long enough to give this topic justice! So we're back to discuss The Design Thinking Process with enough time to really dive into exercises and methods of drawing out effective solutions to the sticky problems we deal with in campus sustainability.  Originating from the Stanford Design School, the Design Thinking Process has exploded in the design fields and has been taking the business world by storm. However, the method has not been largely used in the sustainability world, a place where its unique approach to problem definition and solution generation can be especially helpful.   Often, as sustainability professionals, we frame the problems we face from our own points of view: our recycling rate is not high enough, our bike share programs are not being used enough, etc. However, approaching problems from this point of view can often lead to solutions that don't actually address the underlying issues leading to the problems we have identified. Design Thinking turns this process on its head, approaching problems from the experiences of the users, which leads to (often unexpected) insights about true barriers to success and the most effective solutions to achieve the results we want to see.   We have used the Design Thinking process extensively at the University of Denver, from using it to define our Center for Sustainability's mission statement and identity, to finding new ways to approach residential programming when old programs were not working.   This session will take participants through a series of exercises as we move through the full Design Thinking process from empathizing with our users to prototyping new solutions. This session is intended to be fully immersive and interactive and should provide a solid understanding of a variety of approaches to problem orientation and solution generation.",University of Denver,2186,,,,,,,,,,,Coordination & Planning,Campus Engagement,,,,,"design thinking,solutions focus",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Emily Schosid,Sustainability Program Coordinator,University of Denver,2186,Chad King,Sustainability Director,University of Denver,2186,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Schosid_1160.pptx,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/15892/0830_Schosid_1160.pptx,,,,,,
1841,A Key to Co-Creation: The Development and Utilization of a Social Justice Lens,"As evidenced by this national moment, a lack of critical understanding of social justice issues makes co-creating real sustainability goals near impossible. Conversely, thoughtful attention to social justice issues affords any individual or organization the capacity to rise to the challenge of complex global work across lines of race, gender, class and disability (to name a few). More specifically, doing sustainability work through a social justice lens supports the urgent need for national and global collaboration with respect to climate, environmental and sustainability issues and greatly improves the likelihood of developing deeply rooted and long-term solutions. As such, this cross-disciplinary workshop is designed to take campus sustainability work to a deeper level via the use of a critical 'social justice lens' (SJL) to improve its efficacy, increase its reach and power, and ultimately align it more closely with 21st century climate realities. Based on workshops Dr. Hackman has presented across the country, this interactive session begins by setting forth the core components of a critical SJL, then makes explicit connections for its use and transformative import in this current climate change/sustainability moment, and concludes with the presentation of concrete steps regarding the application of a SJL to sustainability work on our campuses. The session is grounded in social justice education and climate change theory (for a shared framework), but spends the bulk of its time in dialogue, application and integration of the content into participants' specific settings.

It builds off the pre-conference facilitation workshop, 'Facilitation for Organizational Change,' in which participants are introduced to core facilitation strategies and have opportunities to practice multi-meeting stakeholder process. Participants will learn how to adapt an agenda in the middle of a meeting to align meetings with overall process goals, to navigate the most challenging meeting behaviors, and to have a set of tools to create agenda activities that will keep their meeting participants engaged and bought into the important work at hand. This workshop provides participants essential tools to engage campus stakeholders in difficult conversations necessary for productive meetings, create clear outcomes, and avoid group-based decision paralysis.

Whether it is a small staff meeting or a campus-wide strategic planning effort, being a confident and effective facilitator is essential. It not only helps you accomplish your goals, but also provides the necessary structure and process for broader organizational change. So, what does it mean to be a strong facilitator? What are concrete tools one can use to lead a group decision-making process? The first part of this workshop will include facilitation refresher activities designed to guide participants through the important steps in group facilitation. The group will be able to test their knowledge of important tools that can help groups generate new ideas as well as help them converge those ideas into actionable next steps. Through fun and interactive activities, participants will be challenged to apply the tools they learn with these engaging, hands-on experiences. In the second part of the workshop, participants will have ample time to practice facilitating meetings using proven techniques and to receive constructive feedback from the group in a safe environment. There will also be time for group discussion where the group will collectively share new ideas as well as help converge those ideas into actionable next steps. This workshop will cover topics such as behavior theory as it pertains to meetings, the role of a facilitator, types of meetings, basic facilitation tools and techniques, difficult conversations and personalities, adaptive facilitation, nonverbal communication, methods of building group consensus, and a holistic process approach to facilitation.",GreenerU,5968,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,"facilitation,organizational change,sustainability officers,project management",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Dallase Scott,Vice President of Change Management,GreenerU,5968,Lisa Bjerke,Senior Program Manager for Change Management,GreenerU,5968,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Bjerke_1536.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/15903/0830_Bjerke_1536.pdf,,,,,,

Led by an independent NGO and co-created with a community of users and contributors, Sulitest is supported by more than forty international institutions and networks such as UNESCO, UNEP, UNGC PRME, GRLI, IAU and UNDESA. Sulitest offers a set of online tools for raising awareness and improving understanding of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Its best-known tool, the 'Test,' is in an easy-to-use, on-line, multiple choice question format that consists of an international set of 30 questions (the 'International Core Module') randomly selected from an expert-approved database. Each 'Test' question is based on a matrix including an extensive variety of topics - approved by an independent board - and aligned with one or more goals of the Global Agenda, helping to create the largest database mapping citizens' awareness of the SDGs. In addition to the 'International Core Module', optional 'Specialized Modules' of 20-questions each focus on either a specific geographic area, or a specific topic.  The session has two main objectives: presenting the tool and its recent improvements so that academic and non-academic stakeholders who are not aware yet can discover it and start using it; organizing a creative session to work collectively on producing new questions to enrich the test with a 'hackathon' format.",U.S. Partnership for Education for Sustainable Development,2782,,,,,,,,,,,Curriculum,Public Engagement,,,,,"sustainability literacy,digital tools,Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",10/30/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Debra Rowe,President,U.S. Partnership for Education for Sustainable Development,2782,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1846,Crafting Communications Campaigns with Impact,"Communications are crucial for engaging campus communities around sustainability and for encouraging transformative action. Indeed, without compelling communication, it would not be possible to tell the story of higher education's contributions to the movement for a sustainable economy. Yet crafting meaningful and engaging communications campaigns is challenging for many, and different institutions require different approaches. A comprehensive communications strategy requires skill with a range of platforms and outreach methods, not to mention a refined style and tone that reinforces an institution's brand. Ideally, sustainability communications also seek to create meaningful behavior change and measure impact by incorporating behavioral science and psychology research and tracking analytics.  This workshop will help attendees craft communications campaigns that use technology and research-based methods to reach and engage a variety of audiences. The workshop will review best practices and guidelines in communications, with hands-on practice in designing communications and messaging for social media, newsletters, websites/blogs, and signage; incorporating principles from psychology and behavioral science; and understanding communications impact through analytics. The workshop is at the intermediate level, but will offer material for both beginner and advanced participants as well.   After a hands-on exploration of communications concepts, participants will work with the presenters and their colleagues to refine a sustainability campaign for their institution.",Colgate University,4155,University of Michigan,1744,Princeton University,2597,University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,,,,,"communications,Communications Track,outreach campaigns,social media",10/30/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Pamela Gramlich,"Assistant Director, Sustainability; Program Coordinator, Environmental Studies",Colgate University,4155,Jess Lasoff-Santos,PhD Student,University of Michigan,1744,Lisa Nicolaison,Engagement and Communications Coordinator,Princeton University,2597,Nathan Jandl,"Assistant Director, Office of Sustainability",University of Wisconsin-Madison,4058,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Nicolaison_1598.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/15910/0830_Nicolaison_1598.pdf,,,,,,
1847,Sustainable Procurement: Considerations and Best Practices,"Strategic sustainable purchasing programs allow institutional purchasers, and colleges and universities in particular to advance the sustainable design of products and services they purchase while realizing environmental savings for their own organization. This workshop explains foundational aspects of a sustainable purchasing program, viewed through the lens of the procurement professional. The workshop's 'Procurement First' philosophy offers solutions that help campuses balance primary procurement needs while integrating sustainable considerations into the purchasing process. Workshop leaders will survey participants prior to the workshop to customize content so that material speaks to the each school's level of maturity and focus and so that breakout groups can be formed accordingly. This may include referencing policy, laws, processes, or procurements that address sustainability, and facilitating conversation around forthcoming initiatives.  Workshop presenters bring more than a decade of sustainable procurement experience and will share best practices and tactics through five workshop modules: Understanding the sustainable purchasing value add; Organizational considerations and buy-in; Commodity prioritization and specification development; Embedding sustainability into the procurement process; Maintaining a sustainable purchasing program. This session is appropriate for members of the procurement team who want to start or grow their sustainable purchasing program as well as sustainability staff looking to influence their procurement colleagues and set campus-wide policies that empower all school purchasers to make procurement decisions that help grow the sustainable economy.",EPEAT/Green Electronics Council,5179,,,,,,,,,,,Purchasing,Coordination & Planning,,,Purchasing/Procurement,,"procurement,green purchasing",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Andrea Desimone,Purchaser Relations Senior Manager,EPEAT/Green Electronics Council,5179,Jonathan Rifkin,Director of Strategic Partnerships,EPEAT/Green Electronics Council,5179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0830_Desimone_1611.pdf,https://files.aievolution.com/ash1901/events/15913/0830_Desimone_1611.pdf,,,,,,
1848,The World Climate Simulation: A Tool to Motivate Science-Informed Climate Action on Your Campus,"Are you looking for a tool to get students engaged, excited, and motivated to take science-informed action on your campus? This workshop will give you hands-on experience with the World Climate simulation: a tool that has been shown to engage students, inform them about climate change, and motivate them to learn and do more.   Participants in World Climate take on the roles of delegates from different countries or regions and are charged with reaching an agreement to limit warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius. Each delegation offers policies to manage its own greenhouse gas emissions. They also pledge either to support or request money from the Green Climate Fund, which was created to help developing countries cut their emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Each group's decisions are entered into C-ROADS, a climate policy model that has been used to support actual negotiations, immediately showing them the expected climate impacts of their choices.   Through this workshop, you will learn how to facilitate World Climate successfully and tie it to opportunities for student learning and action on your campus. We will also share recent and ongoing research about its impact on learning and motivation. Participants in World Climate show increased knowledge about climate change science and higher emotional engagement with the issue. They come away believing that it is not too late for meaningful action. These emotional responses are linked to a stronger desire to learn and do more, from reducing their personal carbon footprints to taking political action. Importantly, we find that these outcomes are robust across diverse political views and sociodemographic groups, including free-market proponents and underrepresented minorities.",University of Massachusetts Lowell,1729,,,,,,,,,,,Campus Engagement,Public Engagement,Air & Climate,,,,"climate action,student engagement",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Juliette Rooney-Varga,"Director, Associate Professor",University of Massachusetts Lowell,1729,Carolyn McCarthy,Staff,University of Massachusetts Lowell,1729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1849,Lots of Watts: Building an Energy Cohort to Buy Big Renewables,"Cohorts of colleges and universities are aggregating energy loads to achieve economies of scale when sourcing renewable energy. This workshop helps campuses achieve dramatic reductions in greenhouse gases by sourcing cost-effective, large-scale, renewable energy. Renewables cohorts improve project economics, including lower PPA prices and risk-adjusted contract terms. Cohorts also reduce soft costs, gain internal momentum, boost confidence to act, and leverage collaboration. Attendees will learn best practices for pursuing aggregated renewables power purchase agreements (PPAs), understanding the multifold economic, risk-management, reputational and academic benefits that can engage your campus stakeholders in supporting an aggregation strategy. We will examine the benefits of this approach by scrutinizing several examples, including MIT's 60 MW solar aggregation with Boston Medical Center and Post Office Square, and the Pennsylvania Higher Education Cohort (PHEC), with Lehigh University, Lafayette College, Muhlenberg College, and Dickinson College. Aggregation benefits come with challenges, some which can be avoided, and others which need close management to keep progress on track and avoid costly delays. The facilitators include individuals who have played leadership roles in  multiple successful renewables aggregations as well as others who are developing new campus renewables cohorts.",CustomerFirst Renewables,7676,Swarthmore College,3879,Lafayette College,1196,Second Nature,0123,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,2697,,,Energy,Investment & Finance,,,,,"renewable energy,large-scale renewable energy,power purchase agreements (PPAs)",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Chris O'Brien,"Director, Business Development",CustomerFirst Renewables,7676,Aurora Winslade,Director of Sustainability,Swarthmore College,3879,Delicia Nahman,Sustainability Director,Lafayette College,1196,Stephen Muzzy,"Climate Programs, Senior Manager",Second Nature,0123,Joe Higgins,Director of Infrastructure Operations,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,2697,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1851,Whole-Campus Behaviour Change: Lessons from a Decade of Green Impact,"Sustainability professionals know they need to engage their campus communities in sustainability but behavior change continues to be a challenge. Green Impact is a staff engagement and student development program that's been developed in the UK over the last decade. It's been recognized by UNESCO as one of nine education for sustainable development (ESD) global laureate programs and is now being used in Australia, New Zealand and across Europe. This session will share learnings from the Green Impact journey that can be applied on any campus, whether you're starting your behavior change work or want to strengthen your current work. Key questions explored will include: What is the importance of behavior change in the workplace? How can you engage your whole-campus? How can you customize communications to best target different members of staff/parts of your organization? How do social change theories apply within a work environment? How can you communicate with both internal and external stakeholders to build engagement? What tools can be used to monitor and evaluate your impact? What's the business case for engagement and behavior change work? Charlotte is an accomplished trainer, facilitator and course coordinator. Action-based learning, inquiry-based learning and reflection are at the heart of how she structures workshops. Facilitation exercises are used to identify and develop ideas, synthesize multiple perspectives, reach consensus and understand different perspectives. In this session, collaborative, respectful, productive and inclusive ground rules will be established that encourage participation and empowerment.

1853,7th Workshop on Research for Sustainability: Investigating Mass Timber as Green Alternative,"Wood is an age-old construction material, first used around ten centuries ago in the building of Neolithic long houses with crude joints that barely held up a roof. Today wood is being re-imagined, able to hold intense weight loads and withstand fire and seismic shocks. Wood is now engineered into cross laminated timber, laminated veneer lumber and glue laminated timber. Wood pulp can even be used for 3D printing applications. These mass timber innovations are being developed to enhance sustainability in the construction sector by reducing use of materials with high embodied energy like steel and concrete and their. The 7th AASHE workshop on research for sustainability will evaluate the use of  mass timber in the construction industry from a sustainability perspective. This event aims to bring leading scholars and researchers together with architects and engineers to introduce the audience to the latest developments in timber research and to discuss new wood products, processes and concepts and their potential as competitors to concrete or steel. Attendees will also examine the environmental benefits of this renewable material and compare it to conventional construction materials in terms of life cycle environmental impact life cycle cost.",University of Arkansas,4466,,,,,,,,,,,Research,Buildings,,,,,"wood,building materials,sustainable materials",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Tahar Messadi,21st Century FJSOA+D Chair of Sustainability,University of Arkansas,4466,Stephen Boss,Professor Environmental Dynamics & Sustainability,University of Arkansas,4466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1854,Using Endowment Investing to Help Create a Sustainable Economy,"The half trillion dollars in endowment funds invested by higher education institutions in the United States represent a relatively untapped resource with immense economic and social power. The past few years have seen a surge in interest and activity around how endowment investment practices can be better aligned with institutional mission, values, and sustainability goals.   This session will include presentations and moderated discussions among leaders in the higher education sustainability movement, senior administrators, and investment professionals about how to address the challenges higher education institutions face in building campus stakeholder consensus, aligning investment policies with mission, and implementing sustainable investing strategies across the endowment portfolio -- outlining successes to date and how stakeholders can align endowment investments with institutional leadership across academics, operations, and research.   This session will be guided by the Roadmap for Intentionally Designed Endowments - a step by step resource geared toward staff, faculty, students, and other higher education endowment stakeholders on navigating the sustainable investing landscape specific to higher education.   Through facilitated dialogue exercises, participants of this session will share where their institutions stand in terms of sustainable endowment investing, learn how to leverage this framework to enhance endowment investing, and be invited to join and help shape the future of the Intentional Endowments Network.  This session will be facilitated by the Intentional Endowments Network, a peer learning network founded in 2014 that has been leading conversations and providing resources for college and university endowments that are interested in mission-aligned investing.",Lewis & Clark College,4199,Cambridge Associates,7701,Intentional Endowments Network,7689,,,,,,,Investment & Finance,,,,,,"endowment,responsible investing",10/27/2019,AASHE,Presentation,Zoe Abbott Boyd,ESG Program Manger,Lewis & Clark College,4199,Amy Dvorak,Sustainability Director,Lewis & Clark College,4199,Michael Pearce,Managing Director,Cambridge Associates,7701,Kaede Kawauchi,Program Manager,Intentional Endowments Network,7689,Anthony Cortese,Principal,Intentional Endowments Network,7689,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2582,Designing for Change in Higher Education,"The campus sustainability movement and divest-invest campaigns occurring on campuses across the nation have done excellent work articulating what higher education should move away from. But what should colleges and universities move towards? The  UC Community Economies Network is a student-driven initiative to connect individuals and groups across the University of California system who are working to build more just, sustainable, and democratic economies in the neighborhoods and regions surrounding the 10 UC campuses and abroad, where the UC maintains long-term partnerships. As a separate branch of state government, the UC has enormous potential to shift economic policy for the fifth-largest economy in the world.  Using the creation of the UC Community Economies Network as a case study, workshop participants will outline pathways and priorities for creating regenerative economies through community partnerships, both at the campus level and across state systems of higher education. The added challenge of sustaining student-driven campaigns and organizations over time will be a key topic of discussion.
